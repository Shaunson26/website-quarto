[H]{.large-letter}ello! I'm Shaun Nielsen.

I have a diverse professional background encompassing Biostatistics, Data Integration and Engineering, Bioinformatics, Web Development, System Administration. My career spans roles as a Biostatistician and Data Analyst at NSW Health, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of NSW and as a Freelancer in Information Technology.

I have conducted ecological research and worked in public health, leveraging my analytical and technical skills to provide robust data assets that drive insights, inform decision-making and add to our body of knowledge. Additionally, I bridge technical expertise with creative problem-solving by engaging in website development projects.

## Some projects

::: sn-list-items

- Health data pipeline management

Developed and maintained a Windows server cluster at NSW Health for scheduled ETL pipelines, dashboard creation and ad-hock data requests, with automated error reporting and summary e-mail notifications, and task logging for troubleshooting. I introduced version control, modularised pipeline steps, created functions in pipelines and improved documentation for future future personel. 

- Predictive modelling for escalation in therapy of children with IBD

Used statistical learning techniques to build a prediction model for paediatric use of ‘biologics’ in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using blood and stool biomarkers, with researchers and clinicians at the Sydney Children’s Hospital and University of NSW (Australia). See the working prediction model as a shiny app [here](https://shaun-nielsen.shinyapps.io/inflix-predict/).


- Data normalisation and visualisation templates for NSW Arbovirus and Mosquito Monitoring Surveillance Program

Normalised the Arbovirus survey, laboratory and notification data, and prototyped visualisations (geographic maps, bar and line charts, heatmaps), for downstream developer use in creating the “NSW Arbovirus and Mosquito Monitoring Surveillance Program Dashboard” from Environmental Health Branch (NSW Health, Australia).  The data is used in a PowerBI report [here](https://uatweb.datansw.links.com.au/insights/arbovirus).

- Data pipeline formalisation for spatial smoothing of health indicators

Applied software engineering and development principles to generalize, formalize and package the codebase for model based, spatial smoothing pipelines of HealthStats NSW indictors within an R package framework, including the modular functions, documentation, vignettes and unit testing.

- Biostatistics refractive eye surgery 

Biostatistical consultant - designed the Statistical Analysis Protocol for a project analysing visual outcomes, efficacy and safety of a new generation laser eye machines with researchers at the University of NSW (Australia), Shroff Eye Centre, New Delhi (India) and Johnson & Johnson Vision (Singapore). 

- Web application exploring local climate projections and politican voting on climate policies 

Developed and deployed an MVP web application for local climate projection and politician voting analysis with researchers from the University of Sydney (Australia). Integrated and processed data from multiple data APIs, created a fast and accurate address search database, managed the server deployment and used continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices.
