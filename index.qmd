[H]{.large-letter}ello! I'm Shaun Nielsen.

I have a diverse professional background encompassing Biostatistics, Data Integration and Engineering, Web Development, and System Administration. My career spans roles as a Biostatistician and Data Analyst at NSW Health, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of NSW and as a Freelancer in Information Technology.

I have conducted ecological research and worked in public health, leveraging my analytical and technical skills to provide robust data assets that drive insights, inform decision-making and add to our body of knowledge. Additionally, I bridge technical expertise with creative problem-solving by engaging in website development projects.

## Some projects

::: sn-list-items
- Predictive modelling for escalation in therapy of children with IBD

Used statistical learning techniques to predict escalation in therapy from blood,
stool and demographic biomarkers/predictors for children with IBD in collaboration with
researchers and clinicians from The Sydney Children's hospital. See the working prediction
model as a shiny app [here](https://shaun-nielsen.shinyapps.io/inflix-predict/).


- Data standardisation and normalisation from Arbovirus field records

Standardised data from mosquito trapping and chicken antibody data across sites and
sampling dates in NSW from historical records and for future data for efficient 
reporting for NSW Arbovirus and Mosquito Monitoring Surveillance Program. The data
is used in PowerBI reports [here](https://uatweb.datansw.links.com.au/insights/arbovirus).

- Data pipeline formalisation for spatial smoothing of health indicators

- Biostatistics of results from refractive eye surgery 

...

- Web app construction for personalized climate projections and politician behaviour
