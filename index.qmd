Hello! I'm Shaun Nielsen and I'm a Data Scientist.

I enjoy doing data related things such as Biostatistics, Integration and Engineering as well as Web Development and System Administration. 

I have worked as a freelancer, as a Bio-statistician and Data Analyst at NSW Health, and as a Bioinformatician and Researcher at the University of NSW. 

My career has taken me from ecological research (marine, agricultural and human gut) to
data intelligence for NSW Health's COVID-19 public health response to creating data pipelines and creating prediction models as well as website development.
