15/2/23, 5:41 am - Jono: She loves digging in to City. It's in her DNA
15/2/23, 5:41 am - Gerrard: City cheated the entire league in my opinion

16/2/23, 4:14 am - Jono: I think mentally just taking a bit of time to adapt to Chelsea's system. He is slower than i thought though.
16/2/23, 4:16 am - Jono: I daresay his influence on the World Cup gives him a few mentality points. He's no way in hell worth even half what they paid though. Benfica are raking it in
16/2/23, 4:16 am - Gerrard: El Hadji Diouf
16/2/23, 4:16 am - Jono: That's a reach

21/4/23, 9:52 pm - Jono: Us at Palace levels
21/4/23, 10:35 pm - Jono: How embarrassing it will be if Arsenal let it slip against a team wearing jerseys as horrific as the saints are today…. Jesus fuck

22/4/23, 1:27 am - Pero: Trossard hitting the cross bar so close
22/4/23, 2:17 am - Gerrard: I think I'll watch the 9min highlights of today's game 😁
22/4/23, 2:35 pm - Gerrard: https://bleacherreport.com/post/uk-national/98541b48-856e-4fc2-aa2f-948d3991dabb

26/4/23, 11:06 pm - Gerrard: Arsenal too weak today
26/4/23, 11:07 pm - Gerrard: Don't like the captain's effort on that 3rd City goal
26/4/23, 11:08 pm - Gerrard: Can't believe your boys let City win the title, very disappointing
26/4/23, 11:15 pm - Pero: We still 1st
26/4/23, 11:16 pm - Jono: All today proves is that Liverpool winning one and getting close twice to this cheating city team is one of the all time great feats
26/4/23, 11:23 pm - Pero: Same liverpool team battling for conference league spot this season. Maybe it was a lucky year when they won it
26/4/23, 11:26 pm - Jono: I’m just glad we’ll now not be the only team to have not won the league from leading it at Christmas

30/4/23, 12:45 pm - Louie: The ref also refs at the indoor comp at Homebush. He probably one of the best refs I’ve played with, solid understanding of the rules, doesn’t needless interrupt the game, knows when to play advantage and allows a bit of rough play. He is a well respected ref in the comp and didn’t deserve this. This wanker deserves as much jail time as possible.
30/4/23, 12:47 pm - Jono: Yeah I've heard he's one of the good ones. Bloke who hit him also got into a fight with a mate of mine during a trial match against this team a few months back.
30/4/23, 12:51 pm - Louie: Definitely a life time ban from all forms of soccer. If his club knew he had a history of this, then they should cop a penalty of some sort as well.

10/8/23, 6:29 pm - Pero: I didn't think it was Anthony Lay, I can't remember his name but he was such a piece of shit he used to roll his own friends outside of school and then come to school the next day pretending nothing happened

14/8/23, 11:59 am - Jono: Unbelievable call hey
14/8/23, 11:59 am - Jono: Not surprised though
14/8/23, 11:59 am - Gerrard: Even Gary Neville was saying handball
14/8/23, 12:00 pm - Jono: Commentators one second were saying absolute handball then convinced themselves it wasn’t 5 seconds later because it’s Liverpool
14/8/23, 12:16 pm - Jono: I was internally bitching about Darwin when he was fucking around late in the game then 5 seconds later almost pulls off a Sturridge worldy from nothing
14/8/23, 12:16 pm - Gerrard: Needs a haircut
14/8/23, 12:16 pm - Jono: Can’t believe the cunt didn’t control the ball from that keeper error
14/8/23, 12:16 pm - Jono: People blaming Macca for the weight of the pass….
14/8/23, 12:17 pm - Jono: Bro
14/8/23, 12:17 pm - Gerrard: Bruh
14/8/23, 12:17 pm - Jono: You’re a pro
14/8/23, 12:17 pm - Jono: Strikers instincts
14/8/23, 12:17 pm - Gerrard: Your mate
14/8/23, 12:17 pm - Jono: Haaland would’ve just volleyed it first touch into the top corner
14/8/23, 12:17 pm - Gerrard: Why don't you marry him
14/8/23, 12:18 pm - Jono: I was never convinced by Darwin pre LFC… drank the kool-aid of excitement when we got him but yeah, it’s watered down now
14/8/23, 12:19 pm - Jono: I’ll just break up with the premier league instead…
14/8/23, 12:19 pm - Gerrard: Yeah saw the City highlights and thought fuck it
14/8/23, 12:20 pm - Jono: I was correct in being so uninterested this season
14/8/23, 12:25 pm - Gerrard: Aleague!
14/8/23, 12:26 pm - Jono: Yeah I’m at that point
14/8/23, 12:26 pm - Jono: James wants to go to games too
14/8/23, 12:26 pm - Gerrard: Yeah boi
14/8/23, 12:27 pm - Gerrard: He can watch a Newcastle team that have a chance at winning something
14/8/23, 12:36 pm - Chris: No thanks. I'd rather the saudi league.
14/8/23, 12:37 pm - Pero: Hand was at the body probably why they didn't give it a pen
14/8/23, 12:38 pm - Jono: That would make sense if without it hitting his hand it was gonna hit his chest
14/8/23, 12:38 pm - Chris: It wasn't but it also wasn't intentional. And with all the rule changes I don't know what's what anymore.
14/8/23, 12:38 pm - Jono: Most replays suggest it was gonna go across him
14/8/23, 12:39 pm - Jono: And if it’s on it’s way to goal
14/8/23, 12:39 pm - Jono: It doesn’t matter if it’s intentional or not
14/8/23, 12:39 pm - Jono: But agreed the rule changes every fucking week
14/8/23, 12:40 pm - Jono: Cunts are getting hacked to shit and somehow being the only one getting a yellow just got lifting their hand to gesture for a card to be given
14/8/23, 12:40 pm - Chris: Also what happened to Wenger's offside rule change? I thought that was gonna happen
14/8/23, 12:40 pm - Jono: Just for*
14/8/23, 12:41 pm - Jono: Nuh clubs voted against it apparently
14/8/23, 12:41 pm - Jono: Most freaking out knowing their defensive stocks are shit as it is
14/8/23, 12:41 pm - Jono: LFC included

14/8/23, 12:45 pm - Jono: Looks like it nowadays
14/8/23, 12:45 pm - Jono: Still trips me out Goran Ivanisevic sits in Djokavic’s box
14/8/23, 12:56 pm - Pero: Too many croats in city which is terribly disappointing

14/8/23, 11:55 pm - Louie: Unbiased view: anywhere else on the field that’s a foul. Only reason I reckon they wouldn’t have given it, is because Onana had his eye on the ball the whole time. But even then it’s a stretch.
14/8/23, 11:55 pm - Louie: Can’t complain if it was given but it’s wasn’t, so GGMU!!!!!!!

17/8/23, 10:05 am - Pero: They would be scrubbing a while with all the dirty and sweaty rug being served
17/8/23, 10:06 am - Pero: I counted 5/11 of matilda line up ate rug before the match
17/8/23, 10:07 am - Pero: How many in the English lineup eat rug ? They had some dirty tactics
17/8/23, 10:14 am - Gerrard: Wouldn't want to munch English rug, if they don't look after their teeth imagine that shrubbery
17/8/23, 10:20 am - James: You wouldn't be picky now don't lie
17/8/23, 10:22 am - James: Don't know but I read somewhere that an US player is lessing off with Kerr (gross) but she used to rub snatches with one of the England players
17/8/23, 10:34 am - Pero: Tri-rug affair
17/8/23, 10:35 am - Gerrard: Raso in trouble too
17/8/23, 10:35 am - Gerrard: One refused to shake her hand
17/8/23, 10:36 am - Pero: She didn't shake Raso's hand ?
17/8/23, 10:38 am - Gerrard: I think Raso was photographed with some Canuck ones ex a bit too soon and there was dramas
17/8/23, 10:40 am - Pero: Ahh ha go get that minge Raso
17/8/23, 10:40 am - Gerrard: Smash the gash

18/8/23, 2:22 am - James: Let one in five minutes later
18/8/23, 2:22 am - James: Then another
18/8/23, 2:22 am - James: Then you were out
18/8/23, 2:23 am - James: If it wasn't for the weather the English would have took the ashes too
18/8/23, 2:23 am - Chris: But they didn't
18/8/23, 2:23 am - Chris: So here we are. One a piece
18/8/23, 2:25 am - James: Na think you are ahead because of that icon photo that bought a nation to its feet
18/8/23, 2:28 am - Chris: This will be the first time more people watch the 3rd place play off than the final. No one cares about England
18/8/23, 2:29 am - Gerrard: Though I may watch it for the chance of English tears
18/8/23, 2:30 am - Chris: Might catch the last 15 if I can be bothered
18/8/23, 2:30 am - Gerrard: Check the score forst
18/8/23, 2:30 am - Gerrard: First
18/8/23, 2:31 am - James: I care

18/8/23, 2:32 am - James: And anyway, at the end of the day you'll always have that iconic photo of Sam Kerr
18/8/23, 2:32 am - Gerrard: Biggest lie ever told
18/8/23, 2:33 am - James: Having it in your louvre
18/8/23, 2:34 am - Gerrard: Also as Liverpool fans we've got 6 CL trophies to think about, and you've got Alan Shearer to think about
18/8/23, 2:34 am - Gerrard: We're all winners here
18/8/23, 2:34 am - Gerrard: Up the lads
18/8/23, 2:34 am - James: What has Newcastle got to do with any of this. You are just like Klopp
18/8/23, 2:34 am - Gerrard: Everyone's a winner baby
18/8/23, 2:35 am - James: If you're a winner then I'd hate to be a loser
18/8/23, 2:35 am - Gerrard: We all feel the love
18/8/23, 2:35 am - Gerrard: But you are a loser
18/8/23, 2:35 am - James: These grief stages are all over the shop
18/8/23, 2:35 am - Gerrard: When have any team you support won anything?
18/8/23, 2:35 am - Gerrard: Championship doesn't count
18/8/23, 2:36 am - Gerrard: Had to be quick there
18/8/23, 2:36 am - Gerrard: Almost left that open
18/8/23, 2:45 am - James: What does that have to do with me?
18/8/23, 2:46 am - Gerrard: Great fan
18/8/23, 2:46 am - Gerrard: No connection to the club he supports
18/8/23, 2:46 am - Gerrard: Typing
18/8/23, 2:46 am - Gerrard: Typing
18/8/23, 2:46 am - Gerrard: Typing
18/8/23, 2:46 am - James: What does a bunch of Aussies supporting an English team who were successful before you were born have to do with you being a winner
18/8/23, 2:46 am - Gerrard: Bet it'll be good
18/8/23, 2:46 am - Gerrard: I was wring
18/8/23, 2:46 am - Gerrard: Wrong
18/8/23, 2:47 am - Gerrard: Going again though
18/8/23, 2:47 am - James: I have more connection with Newcastle than you with anything English
18/8/23, 2:47 am - James: But you are a winner
18/8/23, 2:47 am - Gerrard: This one will be.... Nah again not it
18/8/23, 2:47 am - Gerrard: Whiffing on these sledges
18/8/23, 2:47 am - James: Rodwell was right. I have broken you 🤣
18/8/23, 2:48 am - Gerrard: Whiff
18/8/23, 2:48 am - James: Only one game into the season
18/8/23, 2:48 am - Gerrard: Whiff
18/8/23, 2:48 am - Gerrard: Should remind yourself this, so much talking after one game

19/8/23, 12:32 pm - Gerrard: Pero's making lists of gay people and has watched every Hilter doco on Netflix.......
19/8/23, 12:34 pm - Pero: They say Aussies and Brazil have the most in the whole comp
19/8/23, 12:47 pm - Chris: A shame we went out with a whimper. Feels like the girls gave all they had in the France game.
19/8/23, 12:47 pm - Gerrard: Manager's fault
19/8/23, 12:48 pm - Chris: I wonder if Kerr had a negative effect. I feel we missed a lot with Kennedy out. Just team dynamics maybe.
19/8/23, 12:50 pm - Chris: I feel like when Kerr was on, raso and foord weren't as involved. Maybe they were but it's just the vibe I got.
19/8/23, 12:51 pm - Gerrard: The English manager's tactics/formation killed the Raso and Foord play
19/8/23, 12:52 pm - Chris: Did the swede managers tactic kill it too?
19/8/23, 12:53 pm - Gerrard: Didn't watch the loser medal award match
19/8/23, 12:57 pm - Gerrard: Harry Kane goal and assist
19/8/23, 1:08 pm - Gerrard added Dave and Liam
19/8/23, 1:09 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/aBxVnmdRDEI?si=Bi4b7detaciv2GYd
19/8/23, 1:20 pm - Pero: There was no link between midfield and kerr/fowler. Swede's too strong in the end
19/8/23, 1:21 pm - Pero: It's hard to beat the Swedish keeper aswell
19/8/23, 1:26 pm - Gerrard: 10/10
19/8/23, 2:11 pm - Jono: I’d love to beat her
19/8/23, 2:23 pm - Gerrard: Alright Greenwood
19/8/23, 4:02 pm - Gerrard: Lol
19/8/23, 5:26 pm - Jono: Our Hungarian
19/8/23, 5:26 pm - Jono: Is good
19/8/23, 5:26 pm - Jono: Won’t bother with the name
19/8/23, 5:26 pm - Gerrard: The great 8
19/8/23, 5:26 pm - Jono: He’ll win us the league
19/8/23, 5:27 pm - Gerrard: What year?
19/8/23, 5:27 pm - Jono: Every?
19/8/23, 5:36 pm - Jono: So many mingin away strips
19/8/23, 5:36 pm - Gerrard: Wow
19/8/23, 5:37 pm - Jono: This Bournemouth one is horrific
19/8/23, 5:45 pm - Dave: Liverpool are title contenders, what a result with ten men. Szlob the man
19/8/23, 5:46 pm - Gerrard: 3 Diaz
2 Slob
1 Endo
19/8/23, 5:46 pm - Gerrard: And then I'm taking Allison for granted also
19/8/23, 5:49 pm - Dave: Alisson always number 1, turns up rain or shine
19/8/23, 5:49 pm - Dave: Statement win to concede that early on, get a red and still come away with a solid 3 points
19/8/23, 5:49 pm - Gerrard: Red was a yellow, legit
19/8/23, 5:50 pm - Gerrard: Ref and VAR not having a great start to the season
19/8/23, 5:52 pm - Dave: Saw a questionable Szlob dive given as well. Failed experiment, should release audio for every controversial decision
19/8/23, 5:53 pm - Gerrard: He did the double leg flick up but did get kicked, silly bugger defender
19/8/23, 5:54 pm - Gerrard: Allison best keeper in the world (except that one fuck up)
19/8/23, 5:56 pm - Dave: Only saw it from one angle, semi watching game whilst trying to get out door
19/8/23, 5:58 pm - Dave: Agree. Actually think we just signed the second best keeper in the prem, really rate Raya. He played in the closed door friendly against Luton a few days ago so Arteta already getting him some action
19/8/23, 5:58 pm - Gerrard: You're quick with the twitter posts about diving though ain't ya
19/8/23, 5:58 pm - Gerrard: But Ramsdale starts right?
19/8/23, 6:00 pm - Dave: The algorithm feeds me anti liverpool, United and city posts, so it doesn’t take much of a search
19/8/23, 6:01 pm - Dave: I think he’s a better keeper than ramsdale. Will see how it pans out, I think ramsdale may end up losing his spot to be honest
19/8/23, 6:02 pm - Dave: Arteta is ruthless, love it
19/8/23, 6:05 pm - Gerrard: Why does all of United's players look like mincers?
19/8/23, 6:06 pm - Gerrard: Who are all these interviewers and commentators???
There was a fucking women talking through the whole game.
19/8/23, 6:09 pm - Gerrard: Gotta rescind that red eh
19/8/23, 10:36 pm - Jono: Angeball beating Manure still not enough @61409710717 ?

20/8/23, 5:08 am - Shaun: Thought this too

20/8/23, 5:41 am - Jono: I think when I was younger I was off Jim Carrey so didn’t really get into his stuff
20/8/23, 5:42 am - Gerrard: I was that for Will Farrell
20/8/23, 5:43 am - Gerrard: Jim Carrey is a legand
20/8/23, 5:43 am - Gerrard: Legend
20/8/23, 5:43 am - Jono: Agreed. Took ages for me to come to that conclusion

20/8/23, 2:27 pm - James: I'd still take Sven in drag over Southgate
20/8/23, 2:28 pm - Chris: But southgate always looks so dapper
20/8/23, 2:33 pm - Pero: The trophy looks like a nutri bullet or blender

20/8/23, 2:47 pm - James: Any way of live streaming the Spanish dressing room right now?
20/8/23, 2:53 pm - Gerrard: You seem really different today
20/8/23, 2:54 pm - James: Was I gay before?
20/8/23, 2:54 pm - Gerrard: Just the messaging this last week vs now is extremely different
20/8/23, 2:55 pm - James: You think too much

21/8/23, 12:37 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 why were the English team so dirty?
21/8/23, 12:39 am - Dave: I was told the Spanish team were time wasting, conning the ref into decisions and the English team played too honest and laid it on thick with gamesmanship
21/8/23, 12:40 am - Dave: Don’t shoot the messenger, I didn’t watch it. Wasn’t getting up at 3am for that
21/8/23, 12:40 am - Shaun: why Caitlin Foord got a black eye?
21/8/23, 12:40 am - Gerrard: You didn't watch it......?
England's biggest game ever and you didn't watch it?!

21/8/23, 12:41 am - Shaun: crazy
21/8/23, 12:41 am - Dave: No. 3am to watch women’s football, you’re alright thanks
21/8/23, 12:44 am - Dave: Now there’s more interest in it and money is flowing into the development, I’ll probably start watching it in the near future. Am sure it’s improved a lot since the last game I watched
21/8/23, 12:47 am - Gerrard: They won the bloody Euros not long ago
21/8/23, 12:47 am - Gerrard: Again something the men couldn't do
21/8/23, 12:48 am - Gerrard: English need to respect their women more
21/8/23, 12:51 am - Dave: Ah yeah, something the Australians are famed for doing

21/8/23, 12:53 am - Dave: Globally renowned for being the most misogynistic men

21/8/23, 1:17 am - Gerrard: If we win on Saturday I'm definitely kissing the CFA prez
21/8/23, 1:58 am - Pero: Ouch ! What did balkans ever to do but enhance the Aussie culture. Misogynistic lebos would come to mind first ?
21/8/23, 1:59 am - Gerrard: I put Italians first
21/8/23, 1:59 am - Jono: Balkans cancelled out all their flaws thanks to the humble cevapi
21/8/23, 2:00 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 you're not used to joking around and subtlety, this is a safe space for jokes unlike the other chat
21/8/23, 2:03 am - Dave: There’s only one member that rage quits the chat every other week.. 👀

21/8/23, 3:25 am - Pero: Geez did he pass after the game?
21/8/23, 3:25 am - Jono: Before the game apparently
21/8/23, 3:25 am - Jono: But they didn't tell her
21/8/23, 3:26 am - Jono: Family didn't want her to know
21/8/23, 3:26 am - Pero: Far out
21/8/23, 4:10 am - Gerrard: Rough turn around on that joy

21/8/23, 4:28 am - Jono: Fucking weird rabbit hole now
21/8/23, 4:28 am - Jono: Father is that old Italian designer
21/8/23, 4:28 am - Gerrard: Why do you know all the ages of celebrity's children?
21/8/23, 4:28 am - Jono: Confusing now

23/8/23, 3:18 am - Dave: Everyone laughed at Owen when he said he’d be 100m plus in todays market. Prime Owen would be 150m+ easy in this market
23/8/23, 3:19 am - Gerrard: Whoa
23/8/23, 3:19 am - Gerrard: Now you're being ridiculous
23/8/23, 3:19 am - Dave: Whoa what? He was unbelievable
23/8/23, 3:19 am - Gerrard: We don't even mention his name in here
23/8/23, 3:19 am - Jono: Post 98 World Cup absolutely
23/8/23, 3:20 am - Jono: Poms were gagging
23/8/23, 3:20 am - Jono: Coz of that THAT goal
23/8/23, 3:20 am - Gerrard: We refer to him as traitorous manc dog dumb fuck, ok @14244893404

23/8/23, 5:43 am - Dave: https://talksport.com/football/1319791/arsenal-brighton-moises-caicedo-transfer-danny-murphy/amp/
23/8/23, 5:43 am - Gerrard: Might have won the league if they had, steal at 70m
23/8/23, 5:44 am - Dave: Wouldn’t pay more than 70m for caicedo. So no, we won’t pay it. Only Chelsea and liverpool pay 115m for average players from the Brighton cartel
23/8/23, 5:45 am - James: Wow
23/8/23, 5:45 am - Jono: Solly March is better than Caicedo
23/8/23, 5:45 am - Dave: Agree
23/8/23, 5:45 am - Jono: Criminally underrated footballer
23/8/23, 5:47 am - Dave: Focus your energy on being nice to your players on social media, trouble in paradise over in the Newcastle camp
23/8/23, 5:49 am - Jono: What is it with Brunos
23/8/23, 5:49 am - Jono: They're all fruitloops
23/8/23, 5:49 am - Jono: And polished turds
23/8/23, 5:50 am - Gerrard: Offft
23/8/23, 5:50 am - Gerrard: All I know is you didn't win and needed a DM 🤷🏼‍♂️
23/8/23, 5:50 am - James: Bruno G and F both walk into that Varpool midfield
23/8/23, 5:51 am - Jono: We have the great Hungarian now
23/8/23, 5:51 am - Gerrard: Fergie's fav
23/8/23, 5:51 am - Jono: About to become PFA POTY
23/8/23, 5:51 am - Dave: Didn’t need a dm. Needed another quality CB, Saliba injury lost us the league imo
23/8/23, 5:52 am - Gerrard: So it's Timber's injurys fault this year?
23/8/23, 5:52 am - Dave: He’s class, really rate him
23/8/23, 5:53 am - Dave: He’s out for 7 months plus. ACL. So we need another defender, yes. One week left, clock is ticking
23/8/23, 5:53 am - James: 🤣
23/8/23, 5:54 am - James: You have Tierney
23/8/23, 5:54 am - James: 🤣
23/8/23, 5:54 am - Gerrard: Did you see my fantasy draft backline?
23/8/23, 5:54 am - Gerrard: Newcastle needed him
23/8/23, 5:54 am - Gerrard: Shame
23/8/23, 5:55 am - James: Varpool do. Tierney would walk into that defence
23/8/23, 5:55 am - Dave: Your number one transfer choice? But arsenal didn’t accept your pitiful loan offer to keep FFP at bay
23/8/23, 5:55 am - James: You signed Raya on loan because of FFP 🤣
23/8/23, 5:55 am - James: Nobody wants Tierney
23/8/23, 5:56 am - James: Scottish cunt
23/8/23, 5:56 am - Gerrard: Like a houso trying to shop in the Tiffany's store - don't even let them in lol
23/8/23, 5:56 am - Dave: And? Brentford snapped it up, small club. You don’t come to the lions of the league with your begging hand out <This message was edited>
23/8/23, 5:57 am - James: A Liverpool fan said this
23/8/23, 5:57 am - Jono: Raya signing will come back to haunt Arsenal
23/8/23, 5:57 am - James: Everyone, just in case you missed it

23/8/23, 5:58 am - James: Ramsdale is a head case
23/8/23, 5:58 am - Gerrard: Oh my gawd he really does think it
23/8/23, 5:58 am - James: He'll fuck up even more now
23/8/23, 5:58 am - Dave: Had the best game he’s had in a long time against palace, think he does well with the pressure
23/8/23, 5:58 am - Jono: Gonna be funny when Newcastle are drawn against us in Rd of 16 Europa
23/8/23, 5:58 am - Gerrard: Remember Leceister got into the CL one year....
23/8/23, 5:59 am - Dave: He’ll be on the bench the moment he makes a mistake imo. Arteta wants Raya, been a target for a long time. And Raya is a better keeper
23/8/23, 5:59 am - James: Is the rumour circulating true that both Caicado and Lavia rejected Varpool because they're busy on Thursday nights?
23/8/23, 6:00 am - Gerrard: Ooooo I've rattled him, lashing out any way he can, such a cutie

23/8/23, 6:27 am - Gerrard: Trying to buddy up to an Arsenal support because no cares about Newcastle
23/8/23, 6:27 am - Gerrard: *supporter

23/8/23, 6:51 am - Gerrard: Ok fuck Ange too
23/8/23, 6:52 am - Dave: Brighton can stay in there because they’re the best run club in the league and have a soft spot for them
23/8/23, 6:53 am - Gerrard: Also never seen Brighton fans attack their players on social media after 1 loss
23/8/23, 6:54 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 should I add Nottingham Forest because of their CL cups?
23/8/23, 6:54 am - Dave: <Media omitted>
23/8/23, 6:54 am - Dave: Haven’t got a chance of second, so no
23/8/23, 6:55 am - Gerrard: Ok so only big clubs with a chance, sorted
23/8/23, 6:55 am - Dave: Neither do Chelsea or United to be honest, fuck them out of it as well
23/8/23, 6:55 am - James: @14244893404 is it insulting he puts Liverpool alongside Arsenal?

23/8/23, 7:50 am - Gerrard: Silver for the win
23/8/23, 7:50 am - James: One bite is all it takes
23/8/23, 7:51 am - Gerrard: See guys, he thinks about Liverpool more than his own team.
23/8/23, 7:51 am - James: Liverpool synonymous with biting?
23/8/23, 7:51 am - James: You said it not me
23/8/23, 7:52 am - Gerrard: Genius

23/8/23, 11:04 pm - Dave: Think the Saudis are pretty progressive now, there was a recent case where they didn’t stone a woman to death for adultery and instead only gave her 3 years in prison ❤️
23/8/23, 11:15 pm - James: Getting there one stone at a time 🔥

25/8/23, 1:04 am - Gerrard: Rodwell the Twitter King is back
25/8/23, 1:04 am - Dave: And tax free in Saudi Arabia, they lose 50% of it in England. Mad. None of us will be able to compete in a couple of years
25/8/23, 1:05 am - Dave: EPL will be a farmers league and Saudi pro league will be new prem lol
25/8/23, 1:05 am - Gerrard: Will Arsenal win a farmers league title?
25/8/23, 1:05 am - James: Meltdown when they loan him to Newcastle next summer
25/8/23, 1:06 am - Dave: Hurting you seeing all these messages this early in the day?
25/8/23, 1:06 am - James: Going Saudi just like Hendo
25/8/23, 1:06 am - James: And Slippy
25/8/23, 1:06 am - James: And Firmino
25/8/23, 1:06 am - Dave: Bet you were waking up in cold sweats thinking it was just a nightmare Salah going to Saudi
25/8/23, 1:06 am - James: And fowler
25/8/23, 1:06 am - Gerrard: God, always trying to bring Newcastle in a convo, no cares about Newcastle bro
25/8/23, 1:07 am - James: My name is James
25/8/23, 1:07 am - Gerrard: Weak sauce
25/8/23, 1:07 am - Dave: Actually wild how many liverpool players have been poached. Liverpool are the new Southampton
25/8/23, 1:07 am - James: @14244893404 Is Jez having a meltdown already
25/8/23, 1:07 am - James: It's only 9am Friday
25/8/23, 1:07 am - Gerrard: Nice try
25/8/23, 1:07 am - Gerrard: Daddy Rodwell
25/8/23, 1:08 am - Dave: Saudi came for Gabriel and edu said they wouldn’t even give them a figure
25/8/23, 1:08 am - Dave: 🔴⚪️
25/8/23, 1:08 am - Gerrard: I was thinking after Fabinho, fuck and look into another teams lineup lol
25/8/23, 1:09 am - Gerrard: We're just so well known around the world
25/8/23, 1:09 am - James: Gabriel is shit
25/8/23, 1:09 am - Dave: To be fair, you should take the giant bag for salah and just rebuild
25/8/23, 1:09 am - James: Fuck Gabriel off
25/8/23, 1:09 am - Dave: He’s going to be done in a year or two
25/8/23, 1:09 am - Gerrard: Can't believe no one was trying to pick up any Newcastle players this window
25/8/23, 1:09 am - James: The Saudis you mean
25/8/23, 1:10 am - Gerrard: All I ever hear is how great they are
25/8/23, 1:10 am - James: Yeah really weird that
25/8/23, 1:10 am - Dave: Offered 100m for him
25/8/23, 1:10 am - Dave: Must be shit
25/8/23, 1:10 am - James: Take it
25/8/23, 1:10 am - James: Insane
25/8/23, 1:11 am - James: I thought that's what they were meant to be doing this summer 🤣
25/8/23, 1:11 am - Gerrard: But only in these two group chats, strange
25/8/23, 1:11 am - Dave: And replace him with who? Every club we approach this late in the window will rip our pants down
25/8/23, 1:11 am - James: Rebuild has been fire so far
25/8/23, 1:11 am - Gerrard: Joe Gomez for 80m
25/8/23, 1:12 am - James: @14244893404 would you take Konate?
25/8/23, 1:12 am - James: Only one in their backline worth a wank tbf
25/8/23, 1:12 am - Dave: Or maguire for 60
25/8/23, 1:12 am - Dave: Yes
25/8/23, 1:12 am - Gerrard: Daddy I need help trying to get a rise
25/8/23, 1:13 am - Gerrard: That didn't go the way you wanted eh
25/8/23, 1:13 am - Gerrard: New angle loading....
25/8/23, 1:13 am - James: Judging by my next comment it was
25/8/23, 1:13 am - James: Having a mare again
25/8/23, 1:13 am - James: Think Jez has only just woke up
25/8/23, 1:13 am - Dave: Konate is class. Not sure if I’d take him over Gabriel but if Gabriel was out the door I’d take konate in a heartbeat
25/8/23, 1:14 am - Gerrard: It's ok I'm sure you'll recover soon
25/8/23, 1:14 am - James: Needs his coco pops first
25/8/23, 1:14 am - James: Yeah. I think he'd jump at the chance to go to Arsenal
25/8/23, 1:14 am - Gerrard: You're not getting the results you're after today, try again tomorrow
25/8/23, 1:14 am - Dave: Like rats off a sinking ship
25/8/23, 1:16 am - Gerrard: Give it til Monday and if Newcastle win your shittalking will be rejuvenated
25/8/23, 1:16 am - Gerrard: 🤞🏻
25/8/23, 1:17 am - Dave: Might go down the liverpool boozer in long beach for that game actually. Will be a good one to watch
25/8/23, 1:17 am - Gerrard: Who's Arsenal got this week?
25/8/23, 1:18 am - Dave: Fulham
25/8/23, 1:18 am - Gerrard: Points
25/8/23, 1:18 am - James: What's the predictions Newcastle v Liverpool?
25/8/23, 1:18 am - Dave: Not necessarily. Wouldn’t say we’ve come out of the gate firing this season. Good to see Jesus back
25/8/23, 1:19 am - Gerrard: Fucking Timber though
25/8/23, 1:20 am - Gerrard: You see who I had in that draft?
Timber James Debruyne Stones Ramsey, all injured
25/8/23, 1:20 am - Dave: Yeah, that injury really upset me. Thought he was going to be an integral part of our campaign. ACL can really fuck players permanently - look at van djik, shell of the player he once was
25/8/23, 1:21 am - Gerrard: Haven't you heard, he's back to old VVD now
25/8/23, 1:21 am - Gerrard: You been living under a rock mate?
25/8/23, 1:21 am - Dave: Just arsenals luck isn’t it. Drop 40m on a player, tears ACL on debut and ends up being abou diaby 2.0
25/8/23, 1:22 am - Dave: Ah yeah, that old chestnut
25/8/23, 1:23 am - Gerrard: Liverpool internet shooting that about
25/8/23, 1:23 am - Gerrard: Two games in
25/8/23, 1:24 am - Dave: If Eddie isn’t a bitch, 3-1 Newcastle. 

I think he’ll play cautiously though and it’ll be a really boring draw
25/8/23, 1:28 am - James: I don't think he will play cautious. He never has at home 🤣

I think draw. Probably a Desmond. Early season one
25/8/23, 1:29 am - Dave: If the Newcastle that showed up against Villa shows up on Sunday, it’s going to be a rough day for Liverpool
25/8/23, 1:31 am - James: I would love to see Luton win at Chelsea tomorrow morning 🤣
25/8/23, 1:46 am - Pero: Geezus Salah going back to his roots
25/8/23, 1:47 am - Pero: Livo need to resign lovren
25/8/23, 2:06 am - Gerrard: He's Egyptian lol
25/8/23, 2:07 am - Gerrard: If Rice cost 100m, Salah 300m?
25/8/23, 2:10 am - Dave: Comparing apples to oranges
25/8/23, 2:11 am - Pero: Same ancestory
25/8/23, 2:11 am - Gerrard: Havertz 60m, Salah 500m
25/8/23, 2:12 am - Gerrard: More Macedonian genes in Egypt
25/8/23, 2:12 am - Chris: Dreaming but sell salah buy mbappe?
25/8/23, 2:12 am - Dave: Think it’s a great deal whatever they agree on. Huge for Saudi Arabia, they get the biggest Muslim footballer in the world and he’s still in his prime. He’ll tear that league up for at least 3 years. Liverpool get a huge bag to rebuild
25/8/23, 2:13 am - Gerrard: Ew
25/8/23, 2:13 am - Gerrard: But Mane was better....
25/8/23, 2:13 am - Dave: Homophobic
25/8/23, 2:13 am - Gerrard: It won't go in a rebuild, straight into FSG pockets
25/8/23, 2:14 am - Gerrard: He's not gay
25/8/23, 2:14 am - Gerrard: I just don't like the french

25/8/23, 11:46 am - Jono: Except the Saudi owned clubs I suppose lol
25/8/23, 11:47 am - James: Disagree. They're not part of uefa and their rules unfortunately. The day they say 'you have to abide by ffp' etc the Saudis will say 'OK, we want to be in the CL then'.
25/8/23, 11:48 am - James: I would imagine, the end will be ffp being ditched or the Saudi clubs will be invited in euro competitions
25/8/23, 11:55 am - James: My point is basically, we don't want the latter because nobody can compete with the Saudi league and if they are invited in then damn
25/8/23, 1:08 pm - Gerrard: 💯

27/8/23, 7:29 pm - Dave: 2-1 and liverpool had ten men since 30 mins 😂😂😂
27/8/23, 7:29 pm - Dave: Howe, wow
27/8/23, 7:30 pm - Jono: Absolute nonce football team
27/8/23, 7:30 pm - Jono: They’ll be out in the group stages
27/8/23, 7:33 pm - Jono: <Media omitted>
27/8/23, 7:33 pm - Jono: Hang it in the Louvre
27/8/23, 7:33 pm - Dave: Howe isn’t good enough. Imagine thinking protecting a lead at st James park against ten men for over an hour is the answer
27/8/23, 7:33 pm - Jono: Wake up @61452662705 lol
27/8/23, 7:34 pm - Dave: YNWA playing over and over in this liverpool bar I’m in, think I’m hanging up the arsenal shirt. I’m being brainwashed
27/8/23, 7:34 pm - Jono: That’s a huge win
27/8/23, 7:34 pm - Jono: We put on a 14 year old at centre back at one stage lol
27/8/23, 7:34 pm - Dave: You could feel the equaliser coming after they took Gordon off and killed the press
27/8/23, 7:35 pm - Dave: Outrageous to get a winner
27/8/23, 7:35 pm - Dave: Congrats lads
27/8/23, 7:35 pm - Jono: Our Hungarian is fucking incredible
27/8/23, 7:35 pm - Jono: Big time. I was shocked he got taken off. Looked the most likely to kill the game
27/8/23, 7:38 pm - Jono: https://x.com/cf_compss/status/1695851822219489524?s=48
27/8/23, 7:40 pm - Dave: Howe killed the lead. Hilarious
27/8/23, 7:40 pm - Dave: Literally threw it away, not good enough
27/8/23, 7:42 pm - Jono: He won’t last if the owners want instant European success
27/8/23, 7:50 pm - Jono: Alisson’s first half save was unbelievable
27/8/23, 9:35 pm - James: Glad I didn't stay up and watch it 🤣
27/8/23, 9:35 pm - James: What happened. All I'm seeing Howe getting sledged
27/8/23, 9:47 pm - Dave: Howe totally fucked it
27/8/23, 10:15 pm - James: If I was Harvey Barnes or Eddie Howe I wouldn't be visiting any Saudi Embassies any time soon

27/8/23, 11:37 pm - Liam: 10 men
27/8/23, 11:37 pm - Liam: At home
27/8/23, 11:37 pm - Liam: Damaging
27/8/23, 11:38 pm - Liam: Nick pope up for corners 😧
27/8/23, 11:39 pm - Liam: Desperate and pathetic @61452662705
27/8/23, 11:41 pm - James: Did he get his head to it?
27/8/23, 11:44 pm - Jono: Not even close
27/8/23, 11:46 pm - Jono: Can also confirm Bruno G is just as much a fraud as Bruno F
27/8/23, 11:46 pm - Jono: He was fucking mingin
27/8/23, 11:47 pm - Jono: Bruno Mars would do a better job
27/8/23, 11:49 pm - Chris: Newcastle are so shit. Really not much else to say
27/8/23, 11:53 pm - Jono: <Media omitted>
27/8/23, 11:53 pm - Jono: When I learn to spell his name I’ll be getting his strip
27/8/23, 11:55 pm - James: All I'm hearing from the two scouse lads at work is Liverpool got battered and Alisson produced a worldie again. Also Anthony Gordon is class?
27/8/23, 11:56 pm - Jono: We were just holding off after the send off but weren’t completely battered. Aside from Almiron’s two shots I never felt too worried we’d concede again
27/8/23, 11:56 pm - Jono: Gordon was the most dangerous so was surprised he got taken off
27/8/23, 11:56 pm - James: And Howe for some reason took Tonali and Gordon off for no reason
27/8/23, 11:57 pm - Jono: That’s Howe for ya
27/8/23, 11:57 pm - Jono: Still a lot to learn
27/8/23, 11:58 pm - Jono: Joelinton was fatigued but would’ve been better to keep on than Bruno G who looked also fatigued and pure shit
28/8/23, 12:00 am - Dave: Neutral here. Could have gone either way until van djik sent off, although I think it was slightly in newcastles favour. 

Down to ten men, Newcastle were all over liverpool for about 30 mins hammering them until Howe decided to go down the “defensive, protect the lead path” and subbed Gordon and Tonali. All liverpool after that, they dicked Newcastle in that last 30 mins and it could have been 3-1 Liverpool. Joke, howe lost the game, piss poor
28/8/23, 12:01 am - Dave: Sloppy United
28/8/23, 12:02 am - James: Why you don't take off your core players.
28/8/23, 12:02 am - Jono: They definitely were hammering us with a high press but felt they couldn’t put any effective crosses in when using the width. So it was only those individual bursts from Almiron and Gordon that got me a little nervous
28/8/23, 12:03 am - Jono: Isak showed nada
28/8/23, 12:03 am - Jono: And neither did Wilson when he came on
28/8/23, 12:03 am - Dave: Gordon was your biggest threat and howe took him off, mind blowing
28/8/23, 12:03 am - Jono: (In 2nd half)
28/8/23, 12:03 am - Dave: Almiron looked class as well, had a worldy
28/8/23, 12:03 am - Dave: Isak looked shite
28/8/23, 12:04 am - James: He took Isak, Tonali, Gordon and Botman off
28/8/23, 12:04 am - Jono: Trippier just had a whinge most of the game
28/8/23, 12:04 am - James: Who else
28/8/23, 12:04 am - Dave: Almiron unlucky not to get one. Had two grey shots
28/8/23, 12:04 am - Jono: He could’ve done a lot more
28/8/23, 12:04 am - Jono: Joelinton
28/8/23, 12:04 am - Dave: Your defence is way too slow as well @61452662705. You need some speed back there
28/8/23, 12:05 am - Jono: Anderson came on for him
28/8/23, 12:05 am - James: Not necessarily and they have livramento and Hall who are fast but probably won't get a game
28/8/23, 12:06 am - Jono: Haha so much depth
28/8/23, 12:06 am - James: Yeah so you don't take two of three midfielders off when in control and also take off who was the best player on the pitch  at the time in gordon
28/8/23, 12:06 am - James: They're both very good players
28/8/23, 12:06 am - Jono: We had to bring on an academy player so Klopp can prove a point to FSG (and still not get any love probably)
28/8/23, 12:07 am - Jono: I know. I didn’t even realise you had Livramento
28/8/23, 12:07 am - James: If he played well then it won't help his cause 🤣
28/8/23, 12:09 am - James: Fail to believe that 🤣
28/8/23, 12:09 am - James: Roadrunner
28/8/23, 12:15 am - James: Was he actually shite? He's been a bit of a bitch recently
28/8/23, 12:22 am - Jono: Yeah lost a lot of ball and whatever passes he landed were just easy ones
28/8/23, 12:36 am - Dave: Hit the post and alisson parried a shit of his off onto the crossbar. Had a great game
28/8/23, 12:50 am - James: He threw a shit at him?
28/8/23, 1:00 am - Dave: A literal shit
28/8/23, 1:02 am - Jono: <Media omitted>
28/8/23, 1:52 am - Jono: Salah’s pass to Nuñez 🤌
28/8/23, 2:18 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I just skimmed over the chat, where is the giant cunt that you've been the last few weeks?
I don't recognise this version of you.
28/8/23, 2:19 am - Jono: Retreating harder than Eddie
28/8/23, 2:21 am - Gerrard: Just for the LOLs eh
28/8/23, 2:21 am - James: Nothing changed because you snatched a win out of nowhere. I still think you're a shambles and nobody wants to play for Liverpool
28/8/23, 2:21 am - Gerrard: Newy eh
28/8/23, 2:22 am - Jono: A lot of snatches on the NUFC coaching staff too
28/8/23, 2:22 am - Gerrard: "Best defence in the league" vs that waste of money Nunez.
28/8/23, 2:22 am - James: Oh
28/8/23, 2:22 am - Jono: They’ll go nowhere without some backbone about them playing 50+ games a year
28/8/23, 2:22 am - James: Liverpool are back this week
28/8/23, 2:22 am - Gerrard: I'd say he's repaid that 80m just fucking with James' day.
28/8/23, 2:22 am - James: Let's see how long that lasts 🤣
28/8/23, 2:23 am - Gerrard: Perfect spend.
28/8/23, 2:23 am - Gerrard: Well Newcastle back lasted about 3months
28/8/23, 2:23 am - Jono: The kiss and wink here was as clinical as the first goal
28/8/23, 2:24 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
28/8/23, 2:24 am - James: Let's see how you get on this season
28/8/23, 2:24 am - Gerrard: 🪇
28/8/23, 2:24 am - James: Were you at the game Jez?
28/8/23, 2:24 am - Gerrard: "See you in the future mate"
28/8/23, 2:24 am - James: Black and white suits you 🥰
28/8/23, 2:24 am - Gerrard: Whiff
28/8/23, 2:25 am - Gerrard: What a wonderful day
28/8/23, 2:25 am - James: Opposed to 'we did this in the past'
28/8/23, 2:25 am - Gerrard: Proper 🪇
28/8/23, 2:26 am - Gerrard: Isak the Diver? 
Daddy @14244893404
28/8/23, 2:26 am - Jono: We should’ve been down to 9 men. Still would’ve got a result
28/8/23, 2:26 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 how good was our Midfield
28/8/23, 2:26 am - Gerrard: Endo 👌🏻
28/8/23, 2:26 am - Jono: Not sure if I’ve told anyone on here yet
28/8/23, 2:27 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 how immense was our shambles defence
28/8/23, 2:27 am - Jono: But the Hungarian is incredible
28/8/23, 2:27 am - Gerrard: Joe Gomez 👌🏻
28/8/23, 2:28 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 how good was our flopp striker
28/8/23, 2:28 am - Jono: I’ll reserve my Joe Gomez praise for when he has a streak of great games 😅
28/8/23, 2:28 am - Gerrard: Is he right footed or left?
28/8/23, 2:28 am - Jono: Macca also was 🤌
28/8/23, 2:29 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 how good was Klopp the Flopp after the red card
28/8/23, 2:29 am - Gerrard: Perfect tactics and subs
28/8/23, 2:29 am - Jono: True manager
28/8/23, 2:29 am - James: 🤢
28/8/23, 2:30 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
28/8/23, 2:30 am - Jono: <Media omitted>
28/8/23, 2:31 am - Jono changed this group's icon
28/8/23, 2:33 am - Gerrard: I think I prefer Liverpool being in crisis and a shambles, with Newcastle flying
28/8/23, 2:33 am - Jono: On top of the red card, we also sacrificed our most in form player
28/8/23, 2:34 am - Jono: To bring on a defender
28/8/23, 2:34 am - Jono: All the cards were dealt for Geordies to belt us 5-nil
28/8/23, 2:34 am - Gerrard: Refs and VAR trying to fuck us still
28/8/23, 2:35 am - Gerrard: Now normally I don't look at the table this early in the season, but James attitude to this season has inspired me.
28/8/23, 2:35 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
28/8/23, 3:25 am - Dave: LOL
28/8/23, 3:26 am - Liam: Chelsea are above newy. DAMAGING

28/8/23, 4:14 am - James: Toxic
28/8/23, 4:15 am - Chris: Not a fan of that cheeky klopp smile?
28/8/23, 4:23 am - Jono: Old mate chose violence and Klopp went die Gewalt
28/8/23, 4:29 am - Gerrard: A lot of the YouTube panel vids were saying that Klopp was doing the whole league a favour telling that assistant to shut the fuck up, must be a thing
28/8/23, 4:32 am - Jono: He talks a lot of shit that guy - always pop ups. Even more than our Pep L
28/8/23, 4:32 am - Jono: Which takes a lot of effort to do
28/8/23, 4:33 am - James: Wait, Arteta?
28/8/23, 4:33 am - James: Surely Flopp is the biggest whinger in the league or am I missing something
28/8/23, 4:39 am - Gerrard: You're missing a lot there bud
28/8/23, 4:47 am - Gerrard: I'm hearing Matip and Gomez were solid.
Down a man and defending against Frogman, Thierry Fake Henry, Flash in the pan Gordon, Relegation Barnes and Championship Wilson - that's impressive.
What throwback.
28/8/23, 4:47 am - Gerrard: *a throwback
28/8/23, 5:06 am - James: So what you're saying is winning wasn't that impressive then?
28/8/23, 5:07 am - Gerrard: Whiff
28/8/23, 5:07 am - James: It's either how shit you've become over the last two seasons or how great we have become in that time?
28/8/23, 5:07 am - James: <Media omitted>
28/8/23, 5:07 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
28/8/23, 5:10 am - James: Has your £100m striker arrived now because of this morning?
28/8/23, 5:10 am - Gerrard: Well worth that to ruin your day
28/8/23, 5:10 am - Dave: That’s class. And I can’t stand klopp, but that’s funny as
28/8/23, 5:20 am - Dave: Skinned “the best lb in the league” twice for almost identical goals. Remember you saying tierney was way too shit to replace the 2 fingered giant.. talk about karma. Should have signed him
28/8/23, 5:20 am - Gerrard: Ooooooh yeah Tierney would've helped Newy today
28/8/23, 5:22 am - James: Tierney is shit hence why he now plays for Sociedad
28/8/23, 5:22 am - Gerrard: I'm getting a feeling that today isn't about how great Liverpool were OR how bad a manager Howe is, I think it was karma or fate after the amount of shittalk Jimmy has done in the last few weeks.
28/8/23, 5:24 am - James: Nothing has changed
28/8/23, 5:25 am - James: Nobody wants to play for you
28/8/23, 5:25 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
28/8/23, 5:25 am - James: You have no money
28/8/23, 5:25 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
28/8/23, 5:26 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
28/8/23, 5:29 am - Dave: If you’d coughed up for him rather than pushing for a loan, he would have been yours and he would have been the difference between a loss and a win today. Shame
28/8/23, 5:31 am - Dave: I actually think howe is a quality manager. Just don’t think he has the experience managing a big club at a top level, case and point today. Today was Klopp Vs Howe and Klopps experience shone through
28/8/23, 5:32 am - Dave: Difficult to argue with 😂 maybe they will after today
28/8/23, 7:56 am - Jono: <Media omitted>
28/8/23, 8:12 am - James: Send them all off

28/8/23, 9:03 am - James: Looks like a plastic. Plastics searching out plastics in here?
28/8/23, 9:08 am - Gerrard: Plastic calling others plastics searching out plastics
28/8/23, 9:11 am - Jono: He looked pretty Geordie to me… cunty
28/8/23, 9:12 am - James: Toxic
28/8/23, 9:12 am - James: Like plastic

28/8/23, 11:35 am - Gerrard: I feel bad for the youtube guys who have to edit their Liverpool wins over Newy highlight reel vids, Liverpool comeback to win against Newy highlight reel vids, and Liverpool beat Newy in injury time highlight reel vids.
28/8/23, 12:33 pm - Jono: https://x.com/chloebloxam/status/1696073900453462040?s=48
28/8/23, 12:45 pm - Gerrard: That atmosphere at StJames is incredible
28/8/23, 12:47 pm - Jono: Big ol stadium for a mentally weak team
28/8/23, 12:48 pm - Jono: That grandstand though has to be one of the tallest around. Looks fucking way up high from the back seats
28/8/23, 1:11 pm - Pero: Poonez had a great start to the season last year aswell, and then he got his nickname
28/8/23, 1:12 pm - Jono: Was was suspended for 3 games at this point lol
28/8/23, 1:12 pm - Jono: He started terribly from memory (aside from the community shield goal)
28/8/23, 1:13 pm - Pero: I remember there was huge hype when he started last season
28/8/23, 1:19 pm - Gerrard: Read the room Pero
28/8/23, 1:21 pm - Pero: My mistake he must of been shit all season then
28/8/23, 1:29 pm - Jono: <Media omitted>
28/8/23, 2:11 pm - Jono: <Media omitted>
28/8/23, 2:21 pm - Jono: Two Newcastle players committted 4 fouls each - and neither got a yellow.
28/8/23, 2:21 pm - Jono: LFC have only had 1 player in the last 2 and a bit seasons who has done the same and not got carded
28/8/23, 2:28 pm - Jono: https://x.com/rovers/status/1696089990436925560?s=48
28/8/23, 3:00 pm - Gerrard: Negative football, a loss for Newy is a victory for football.

29/8/23, 8:18 am - Gerrard: I was gonna recommend watching that Pitchside coverage, hilarious seeing them hammer that Newy producer
29/8/23, 8:19 am - Gerrard: Banger after Banger with this guy, what's the British version of the Tony Awards - he's a shoe in
29/8/23, 9:37 am - Dave: He’s class, he quit his job as a PE teacher to make Darwin nunez vids full time

30/8/23, 1:58 am - James: Fluke
30/8/23, 2:28 am - Gerrard: Tottenham fans turning on Ange, that was quick
30/8/23, 3:05 am - Dave: Are they? 😂
30/8/23, 3:06 am - Dave: Is #angeout trending with #howeout?
30/8/23, 3:08 am - Gerrard: I doubt AngeOUT is as big as HowieOUT
30/8/23, 3:09 am - Dave: Strangely seen a lot of hate for Almiron as well, thought he had a worldie
30/8/23, 3:10 am - Dave: Maybe it’s because he hit the woodwork twice?
30/8/23, 3:12 am - Gerrard: Might be goldfish memory, what have you done for me lately, with these fans
30/8/23, 3:12 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
30/8/23, 3:13 am - Gerrard: And no offence to Arsenal but Allison is my best keeper every year.
30/8/23, 3:13 am - Liam: Ya a lot of Almiron hate
30/8/23, 3:14 am - Gerrard: Poor Frogboy
30/8/23, 3:14 am - Liam: And kane on the right lol
30/8/23, 3:15 am - Liam: True Gordie was laying into him
30/8/23, 3:15 am - Dave: Totally agree. Not sure what rammers is doing there. Alisson should have got it, you’d have been in a whole world more pain last season without him
30/8/23, 3:15 am - Gerrard: Lol fark didn't realise
30/8/23, 3:15 am - Dave: He’s such a cunt that bloke
30/8/23, 3:15 am - Liam: Hate Almiron
30/8/23, 3:15 am - Gerrard: Typical Newy fan
30/8/23, 3:16 am - Dave: Worse than jonathon Morley and Robbie from AFTV
30/8/23, 3:16 am - Liam: Hey! Love Robbie
30/8/23, 3:16 am - Dave: At least you can laugh at these two for their delusion
30/8/23, 3:17 am - Dave: Bet you got a poster of Ty on your wall as well
30/8/23, 3:17 am - Liam: What a picture of the greatest arsenal fan of all time? You don’t?
30/8/23, 3:18 am - Dave: Ty statue lit up by the lava lamp next to the bed
30/8/23, 3:18 am - Dave: Even Robbie had enough of him the other day
30/8/23, 3:19 am - Liam: Enough of him makes him lots of money!!!!

30/8/23, 3:22 am - Gerrard: Damn, Don Robbie put his foot down
30/8/23, 3:22 am - Gerrard: Ty gets angry at any team that takes points of Arsenal
30/8/23, 3:23 am - Dave: Lol. Takes it so personally doesn’t he, like he won the points himself
30/8/23, 3:23 am - Gerrard: I only know one person who's as arrogant a fan as Ty
30/8/23, 3:54 am - James: This chat is as shit as the other one
30/8/23, 4:03 am - Gerrard: Shit, I didn't even say his name and it summoned him

30/8/23, 6:25 am - James: This is class. Boys getting stuck in ✊
30/8/23, 6:27 am - James: This guy sucks. Kane, gerrard and carragher impressions good though. Easy to do when you sound like a spastic chewing a wasp
30/8/23, 6:28 am - Gerrard: I hope they don't forget their roots and get back to this, 2nd biggest team in Newy

30/8/23, 10:19 pm - James: Funny that video was done before he cost you the title last season 🤣
30/8/23, 10:38 pm - Dave: He didn’t cost us the title, depth cost us the title
30/8/23, 10:54 pm - Liam: Last year was a massive success. It was the most exciting time of my life. Saka gave me that ❤️
30/8/23, 10:57 pm - Dave: Everton going through by the skin of their teeth. So shit
31/8/23, 12:05 am - Gerrard: Feels like he gets no love inside the club with that reaction
31/8/23, 12:29 am - James: Just racism and hate

31/8/23, 12:35 am - Gerrard: Bigger club

31/8/23, 3:44 am - James: Current players want to go 🇸🇦
Players your linked with either don't want to join or would rather sit on Chelsea's bench 🔵
And ex 'legends' also want 🇸🇦
31/8/23, 3:44 am - Gerrard: Obsessed-much

1/9/23, 12:14 am - James: Better than getting squished
1/9/23, 12:15 am - James: Only Varpool fans kill other fans though init?

1/9/23, 12:19 am - Dave: He did didn’t he
1/9/23, 12:19 am - Dave: I forgot that
1/9/23, 12:19 am - Dave: “European football is European football”
1/9/23, 12:19 am - James: That's why they signed class players like caciado and Lavia
1/9/23, 12:19 am - James: Oh wait
1/9/23, 12:20 am - James: I mean some Jap nobody heard of and some goofy Dutch fella Bayern bought for £5m and sold to Varpool a year later for £40
1/9/23, 12:35 am - Gerrard: Same same but different
1/9/23, 12:35 am - Gerrard: 🤣 still makes me laughing using players we didn't sign as sledges
1/9/23, 12:37 am - Gerrard: Is it me or does it sound racist coming from Newy fan?
1/9/23, 12:40 am - James: Sledging players you signed too 😮

1/9/23, 3:26 am - Gerrard: Pumped
1/9/23, 3:27 am - Gerrard: Like Newy is gonna get pumped in CL
1/9/23, 3:27 am - James: So you're as good as West Ham?
1/9/23, 3:29 am - Gerrard: Fuck yeah, European champions
1/9/23, 3:30 am - Gerrard: Not league cup runners up
1/9/23, 3:37 am - James: Hope you don't draw Brighton at some stage 😮
1/9/23, 3:37 am - James: Antonio or Nunez?
1/9/23, 3:38 am - Gerrard: You worried about this weekend?
1/9/23, 3:38 am - James: Na
1/9/23, 3:38 am - James: You got Villa haven't you
1/9/23, 3:39 am - Gerrard: Yeah and if they lost to Newy 5-1 we'll be fine
1/9/23, 3:39 am - Gerrard: Huge game for Howie and Newy this weekend, make or break stuff
1/9/23, 3:39 am - Gerrard: Wish you all the best for it
1/9/23, 3:40 am - James: Big weekend for klippity
1/9/23, 3:40 am - James: Can he follow up the fluke last week this week against Emery
1/9/23, 3:40 am - James: Be fun watching Trent v Diaby

1/9/23, 3:08 pm - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
1/9/23, 4:14 pm - Dave: I’m sorry, but your club is insane not to take 150m for a 31 year old
1/9/23, 4:17 pm - Dave: It’s not like you’re title challenging.
He is your biggest asset and you’re one injury or shit season away from not getting an offer anywhere close to that. Take the money and rebuild, look what Klopp did with Coutinho money a few years back
1/9/23, 9:11 pm - James: I'm sorry @61409710717 🤣
1/9/23, 9:15 pm - James: https://twitter.com/IanDoyleSport/status/1697584658140004856?s=08
1/9/23, 9:16 pm - James: @14244893404 read that. Liverpool fans are such a weird bunch
1/9/23, 9:49 pm - Dave: I’m confused? He thinks PIF are trying to weaken Liverpool to benefit Newcastle?
1/9/23, 9:51 pm - James: How they've managed to make this all about them again is bewildering
1/9/23, 9:52 pm - Dave: Does 150m for a 31 year old not benefit them?
1/9/23, 10:07 pm - James: Does £40m for Fabinho or £12m for Henderson
1/9/23, 10:08 pm - Dave: Well honestly
1/9/23, 10:08 pm - Dave: As a neutral I was questioning the Saudi link and gerrard. Looks suspiciously like gerrard is helping his team offload dead wood for exorbitant prices <This message was edited>
1/9/23, 10:09 pm - James: And apparently they're only buying Liverpool players
1/9/23, 10:10 pm - Dave: Semi expecting an announcement that Gabriel is off there in the next couple of hours
1/9/23, 10:11 pm - Dave: Hasn’t started last couple of games since all this chatter about 100m for him
1/9/23, 10:25 pm - James: PIF don't own that club I don't think
1/9/23, 10:26 pm - James: So Varpool fans won't want to hear that theory
1/9/23, 10:54 pm - Dave: Listening to hammers fans singing “we’re going to win the league” and “we’re top of the league” is jokes 😂
1/9/23, 10:54 pm - Dave: Luton are awful, not a prem team
1/9/23, 10:56 pm - Chris: Should have had a pen at the end there. Pretty clear hand ball
1/9/23, 11:05 pm - Dave: For who? Missed it
1/9/23, 11:05 pm - Chris: Luton
1/9/23, 11:06 pm - Chris: Ward prowse jumped defending a corner and hit his arm. Made himself bigger. Can't see how they let that go
1/9/23, 11:42 pm - James: Like Arsenal last season tbf
1/9/23, 11:48 pm - Dave: We were top for 96% of the season
1/9/23, 11:48 pm - Dave: Not 1 game
1/9/23, 11:49 pm - Dave: So inconsistent
1/9/23, 11:50 pm - James: <Media omitted>

2/9/23, 12:11 am - Dave: Can’t see them getting 15 points this season

2/9/23, 2:30 am - Dave: Who are the other 3 teams?
2/9/23, 2:31 am - Dave: Actually I lie, I think I went to toulouse once
2/9/23, 2:31 am - James: Same as CL

2/9/23, 3:58 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
2/9/23, 3:58 am - Gerrard: Now Newy fans are attacking each other, poor form
2/9/23, 4:04 am - James: Australian attacking Australians
2/9/23, 4:04 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 @61452662705 just checking what would the chat be if Salah did go for 175 or 200?
2/9/23, 4:05 am - James: I'd think it was insane and you had the deal of the century
2/9/23, 4:06 am - Gerrard: Don't see it as weakening the current season, not being able to spend the cash until January?
2/9/23, 4:07 am - Gerrard: I don't understand the lateness of it all.
2/9/23, 4:13 am - Dave: Snap their hand off
2/9/23, 4:13 am - Dave: I would be astounded if he hasn’t gone by January transfer window
2/9/23, 4:13 am - Dave: Chat would be, “good business liverpool”
2/9/23, 4:17 am - Dave: Well I guess it’s a question of how much qualifying for champions league is worth to liverpool financially. I genuinely don’t know the £ amount it is worth. Selling Salah could be difference between you getting top 4 or not so I guess they’ll be taking that into consideration
2/9/23, 4:17 am - Gerrard: I don't trust you guys
2/9/23, 4:17 am - Dave: But that offer for a 31 year old forward that relies on his pace is fucking wild, I’d be taking that every day of the week
2/9/23, 4:18 am - Gerrard: Yeah rather confirm before offloading
2/9/23, 4:18 am - Gerrard: Relies on his pace, nice backhander
2/9/23, 4:19 am - James: Poor club tbf
2/9/23, 4:19 am - Gerrard: Still upset about last game
2/9/23, 4:21 am - Jono: I laugh at how normal it seems for a non LFC fans to sell your best and most influential player the day the window shuts with no replacement in mind. Saudis were silly to wait this long tbh and shows their lack of experience in managing these kinds of deals. They’ll get him in Jan or next summer… most likely next summer and likely for the same amount. Wouldn’t be surprised if a deal is struck before this window closes to set it up for end of the season for a lower figure to mitigate risk at Saudi end
2/9/23, 4:21 am - Jono: The club can then prepare for a season long farewell of a club legend and move on more appropriately
2/9/23, 4:22 am - Jono: And line up who we need - common sense
2/9/23, 4:22 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
2/9/23, 4:23 am - Gerrard: Teams with no loyalty and CL trophies don't get it bro
2/9/23, 4:26 am - James: Liverpool never sell their best players!? 🤣
2/9/23, 4:29 am - Dave: How’s that a backhander. He’s world class, one of the best wingers the prem has ever seen. But without his pace, what you going to do with him
2/9/23, 4:29 am - Gerrard: Casuals who only know football through playing FIFA
2/9/23, 4:30 am - Dave: Did Liverpool sell Owen? Or did he leave on a free?
2/9/23, 4:35 am - Jono: Sold for 8.5 million
2/9/23, 4:36 am - Jono: But by then his form had dipped anyway and he wanted out. Diff to Salah who is happy to stay
2/9/23, 4:37 am - Jono: We bought Cisse, Luis Garcia, Xavi Alonso and Morientes that window…

One of them flopped but at least we had attacking coverage despite Owen’s sale
2/9/23, 4:39 am - James: Mane
2/9/23, 4:39 am - James: Coutinho
2/9/23, 4:39 am - James: Wjialdum (refused new contract went to PSG)
2/9/23, 4:39 am - James: Torres
2/9/23, 4:39 am - James: Just off the top of my head
2/9/23, 4:39 am - Jono: Did they all go the day the window shut? That’s my argument here
2/9/23, 4:40 am - Jono: And all except Gini wanted out
2/9/23, 4:40 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 yeah I think Jimmy doesn't understand what we're discussing
2/9/23, 4:41 am - Gerrard: Poor kid's still shellshock
2/9/23, 4:41 am - James: @14244893404 I think Liverpool have kept players such as Alisson because they have been very good for the last five years. Last season, extremely poor so I don't think they can afford another bad season this season otherwise players like that would look to go elsewhere.
2/9/23, 4:41 am - Jono: We sell players, just not irrationally without any planning around it (unless they were intent on leaving)
2/9/23, 4:41 am - James: @14244893404 think Jez has the hots for Big Mo
2/9/23, 4:42 am - James: Don't think there was much planning the last two years hence the shite midfield and defence with zero replacement lined up. This summer it's been a throw shit at a wall and see what sticks in regard to the 'rebuild'
2/9/23, 4:42 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 how are you gonna be if Newy wins tonight vs if Newy loses tonight?
Which one will be better for the group chat?
2/9/23, 4:43 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 he still think we had a bad transfer window lol
2/9/23, 4:43 am - James: It really doesn't bother me four games in. If you lose to villa will you ban me again?
2/9/23, 4:43 am - Jono: Still beat you cunts
2/9/23, 4:43 am - James: You haven't a clue who you've signed 🤣
2/9/23, 4:44 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
2/9/23, 4:44 am - James: 'we beat Newcastle trophy'
2/9/23, 4:44 am - Gerrard: Reigning champs yo
2/9/23, 4:44 am - Gerrard: Money in the bank
2/9/23, 4:44 am - James: Imagine I told you two things are ago that's what you'd be celebrating now 🤣
2/9/23, 4:44 am - James: *years
2/9/23, 4:45 am - James: Like us. But we have real money we like to spend 🇸🇦
2/9/23, 4:45 am - Jono: Our Hungarian will be PFA player of the year… he’s phenomenal.
2/9/23, 4:45 am - James: I like him tbf.
2/9/23, 4:48 am - Jono: He’s better than any of your midfielders imo 

Bruno G proved he’s a gimp and Miggy just making the most of his short man syndrome with a rich vein of form. 

Let’s just see how Newy go with an inexperienced manager first year in the big time in a long while. Watching closely 👀
2/9/23, 4:49 am - Dave: He’s got lovely hair 🥰
2/9/23, 4:50 am - Dave: Have to agree with that
2/9/23, 4:50 am - James: Terrifying
2/9/23, 4:51 am - Dave: “The Newcastle double”. It’s coming back this season. @61452662705 Are Liverpool are your bogie team?
2/9/23, 4:52 am - James: Hold on, I'll actually respond now I've stopped laughing.

You think a Hungarian from Leipzig is better than an Italy international midfielder who won Serie A and was AC Milan captain
2/9/23, 4:52 am - James: Four games in the delusion has began from Varpool fans
2/9/23, 4:53 am - Dave: Won 2, drawn 1. Good start 🤷🏼‍♂️
2/9/23, 4:53 am - James: It's weird how Newcastle really get under their skin. Klopp for example. Can't shut up about Newcastle
2/9/23, 4:54 am - James: Ballon D'Ors all round incoming
2/9/23, 4:54 am - Jono: I’d have liked 1 or 2 more defenders this window but perhaps Klopp sees value in blooding one or two of our young defenders and put his focus on midfielders. 

Caicedo and Lavia were fuck ups but overall happy with what we’ve pulled together. 

Oh yeah the greasy Italian - forgot about him. Shows how little he did the other night.
2/9/23, 4:55 am - James: That's enough cages rattled for today 🤣
2/9/23, 4:55 am - Gerrard: Jimmy is creating a theatre performance here
2/9/23, 4:56 am - James: Jez, babe, don't ban me
2/9/23, 4:56 am - Jono: Pretty content with that. Villa will be tough but confident we won’t do a Newy at home
2/9/23, 4:57 am - James: Usually it's just Jez that bites
2/9/23, 4:58 am - James: Think I'm going to cum
2/9/23, 4:58 am - Gerrard: I just love the guy who's completely rattled every day in here is the first to accuse everyone else as being rattled lol
2/9/23, 4:58 am - Jono: Not many teams have won the league the last 6 seasons with 3 losses
2/9/23, 4:59 am - Jono: You’re 12 hours away from it
2/9/23, 4:59 am - Dave: Do you think you’ve got enough depth and quality in midfield this season to compete with the top 4?
2/9/23, 5:00 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
2/9/23, 5:00 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
2/9/23, 5:00 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
2/9/23, 5:00 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
2/9/23, 5:01 am - Jono: I honestly do. I like our squad. And Jones, Elliott always handle things pretty smoothly off the bench or when they start.
2/9/23, 5:01 am - Gerrard: I notice the team with all the money spent less than Liverpool and Arsenal
2/9/23, 5:06 am - Jono: I’d have preferred more depth in the backline particularly RB / CB - that’s my only concern but every squad has its flaws.
2/9/23, 5:07 am - Jono: Except City
2/9/23, 5:07 am - Jono: They’ll win the league by about 30 points
2/9/23, 5:08 am - Gerrard: Yeah RB
2/9/23, 5:09 am - Gerrard: 20
2/9/23, 5:09 am - Jono: I see they’ve signed their next Kalvin Phillips
2/9/23, 5:11 am - Gerrard: The boycotter
2/9/23, 5:12 am - Jono: So now Phillips only needs to polish one of Rodri’s boots
2/9/23, 5:12 am - Jono: While Nunes polishes the other
2/9/23, 5:12 am - Dave: I think Szlob is going to be instrumental in your campaign this season, if he gets injured I think it’ll be a struggle
2/9/23, 5:13 am - Dave: FFP breathing hot down their necks, on their best behaviour
2/9/23, 5:13 am - Jono: Yeah agreed - he’s gonna boss it assuming he stays fit most of the season
2/9/23, 5:13 am - Dave: Surprised they haven’t done a Chelsea and signed everyone up on 42 year contracts
2/9/23, 5:15 am - Gerrard: Trying the loan from Saudi approach?
2/9/23, 5:20 am - Dave: Yeah James said that’s going to start happening
2/9/23, 5:20 am - Dave: Makes sense
2/9/23, 5:20 am - Gerrard: Newy are everything wrong with football at the moment, shame
2/9/23, 5:23 am - James: Varpool started it in the 60s, 70s and 80s
2/9/23, 5:23 am - James: Varpool started the rot
2/9/23, 5:23 am - James: Got all English clubs banned from Europe too
2/9/23, 5:23 am - James: Cunt club. Cunt fans
2/9/23, 5:44 am - Gerrard: 🪇
2/9/23, 5:44 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/pGnNTb7iyhg?si=klmU6-J43fQ3Lqdn
Newy and Arsenal first two up
2/9/23, 6:24 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
2/9/23, 6:40 am - James: Good player. No buy option
2/9/23, 6:41 am - Dave: Ouch. Burn and botman did so well defending against a rapid forward last weekend
2/9/23, 6:41 am - James: Iwobi and Mupay got the fuck outta Everton under the radar
2/9/23, 6:41 am - Dave: Did they?

2/9/23, 6:42 am - James: If Pauliha was available why didn't Varpool go for him?
2/9/23, 6:42 am - James: His move to Bayern fell through
2/9/23, 6:43 am - James: And bayern shipped out Ravenberch or whatever his name is because he was a failure and they were getting the lad from Fulham
2/9/23, 6:43 am - James: Brentford

2/9/23, 5:49 pm - Jono: Chelsea 🤣
2/9/23, 6:07 pm - Dave: So good
2/9/23, 6:09 pm - Dave: Best part of my morning was spamming screenshots of city to everyone drawing with Fulham 1-1 at half time with only 2 shots thinking they were going to drop points
2/9/23, 7:59 pm - Dave: Newcastle lol
2/9/23, 8:00 pm - Dave: “Best defence in the league” getting their pants ripped down by a 17 year old hat trick

2/9/23, 10:39 pm - Jono: Think the players got the wrong memo wearing the Saudi kits
2/9/23, 10:39 pm - Jono: Play hard for the Saudis
2/9/23, 10:40 pm - Jono: Don’t play like the Saudis
2/9/23, 10:55 pm - Dave: Total shell of the team they were last season. Howe beheading incoming
2/9/23, 10:56 pm - Jono: And they’re only playing once a week… wait till europe kicks in lol
2/9/23, 10:59 pm - Jono: Serie A champion and Italian international getting subbed off 57 minutes in. Superstar eh
2/9/23, 11:00 pm - Dave: #howeout trending
2/9/23, 11:02 pm - Chris: Howe fearing the chop
3/9/23, 12:53 am - Liam: Pope is a liability
3/9/23, 1:07 am - Dave: A lot of people are saying that
3/9/23, 1:10 am - Liam: Thierry Isak went missing again.
3/9/23, 1:19 am - Jono: Hang on, needed stop crying of laughter at this ridiculous statement.

You telling me an English international benchwarmer and all round top lad is a liability?!
3/9/23, 1:21 am - Jono: Eddie How-ut
3/9/23, 1:21 am - Shaun: @61404060785 I just fixed your fantasy team. Your line up was illegal
3/9/23, 1:22 am - Jono: What happened lol
3/9/23, 1:22 am - Jono: I haven’t touched it in weeks
3/9/23, 1:22 am - Shaun: You had 2 G and 4 F fielded.. Yeh I don't understand how
3/9/23, 1:23 am - Shaun: You were receiving no points 🤷‍♂️
3/9/23, 1:48 am - Chris: Why fix it? 😆
3/9/23, 1:48 am - Jono: I gave up pretty quickly on that shitty app and weird point scoring system
3/9/23, 1:49 am - Chris: You couldn't wait till after this round? I'm versing him this week
3/9/23, 1:50 am - Chris: Jono, you had Ferguson on your bench. Hattrick hero and you benched him
3/9/23, 1:51 am - Jono: I struggle to have any love for anyone with that surname
3/9/23, 1:54 am - Gerrard: Have they lost the right to claim this now?
3/9/23, 1:56 am - Liam: Anyone heard from James. I would love to hear his match analysis
3/9/23, 1:56 am - Gerrard: Just wanted to answer this one again,
Yes, Yes I do.
3/9/23, 1:56 am - Jono: @61452662705 bro

3/9/23, 2:00 am - Dave: @61452662705
3/9/23, 2:00 am - Jono: As illegal as the transactions from Citeh and Saudi FC?
3/9/23, 2:01 am - Jono: Imagine cheating and still being shite
3/9/23, 2:02 am - Gerrard: Gonna cook a nice bacon and egg brekkie and watch the highlights of the 14th best team in the league @61452662705
3/9/23, 2:02 am - Jono: The new Leicester
3/9/23, 2:02 am - Jono: Without the league title

3/9/23, 2:46 am - Gerrard: How about now?
3/9/23, 2:49 am - Gerrard: Nick Pope 😱
3/9/23, 2:50 am - Gerrard: Trippier defending 😱
3/9/23, 2:55 am - Gerrard: Fuck, Howie looks worried
3/9/23, 3:01 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/tPZC4AvbB1s?si=10Hm9t4faGwI7gPg
3/9/23, 3:02 am - Liam: @61452662705 I’m worried sick, please let us know you are ok?
3/9/23, 3:21 am - Gerrard: Well hopefully he's sleeping because he stayed up to watch it live
3/9/23, 3:54 am - James: <Media omitted>
3/9/23, 3:54 am - Liam: Howe out?
3/9/23, 3:55 am - Dave: Pulled him from my FPL team
3/9/23, 3:55 am - Dave: Dog shit
3/9/23, 3:55 am - James: No chance
3/9/23, 3:55 am - Liam: Who shall we blame?
3/9/23, 3:56 am - James: Nobody. Praise Brighton and the Irish lad they'll sell to Chelsea for £150m next summer
3/9/23, 3:56 am - James: Actually, pope
3/9/23, 3:56 am - James: And that shocking green kit
3/9/23, 3:58 am - Gerrard: Someone check on Ash and the dogs
3/9/23, 3:59 am - Liam: Awful keeper
3/9/23, 4:05 am - Dave: You admitting he’s barely scraping top 5 English keepers now?
3/9/23, 4:14 am - James: Pickford has got the save of the season two weeks in a row now
3/9/23, 4:33 am - Liam: He’s got to go!
3/9/23, 5:20 am - Dave: Pickford is best English keeper
3/9/23, 5:20 am - Dave: Followed by ramsdale
3/9/23, 5:23 am - Dave: Newcastle should have bolstered that defence this window. So slow and look tired
3/9/23, 5:53 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
3/9/23, 5:54 am - Gerrard: Not willing to back a championship manager
3/9/23, 5:56 am - Dave: Tonali and Barnes are decent signings
3/9/23, 6:11 am - Gerrard: Haven't seen enough of Tonali to see anything from him, Barnes is a good squad player - better than Froggie
3/9/23, 6:12 am - Dave: I’ve seen enough of Tonali to know he’s a good addition to that Newcastle squad. Don’t think he will be a net negative you know? World beater? Who knows..
3/9/23, 6:16 am - Gerrard: They saying Bruno G and Tonali can't play together
3/9/23, 6:18 am - Dave: I’m just going off the first game I saw Tonali play
3/9/23, 6:18 am - Dave: Though he looked decent. Not working out with Bruno?
3/9/23, 6:18 am - Dave: @61452662705 ?
3/9/23, 6:37 am - Gerrard: I think Liverpool and Newy freaky Friday'd their defences
3/9/23, 6:38 am - Gerrard: Newy conceded 7 in 4, no cleansheets, that Ferguson 2nd was like Moses parting the red sea
3/9/23, 6:56 am - James: Yep
3/9/23, 6:56 am - James: Ask again after game 10
3/9/23, 6:58 am - Gerrard: Countdown to Round 10
3/9/23, 7:44 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/sw4J07YXzzA?si=LxY0RAs9SL6tUkI-
3/9/23, 7:48 am - Gerrard: Don Robbie ain't credible is he
3/9/23, 7:49 am - Dave: What would be your 11 @61409710717 ?
3/9/23, 7:49 am - Gerrard: Who starts for both teams?
3/9/23, 7:50 am - Gerrard: Currently
3/9/23, 7:50 am - Dave: Yep
3/9/23, 7:50 am - Gerrard: I'm asking who does for each team currently
3/9/23, 7:50 am - Gerrard: I don't know either of your teams
3/9/23, 7:52 am - Gerrard: Robbie has no clue
3/9/23, 12:29 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/F8QuipJalmE?si=7Ny7SQuvnqxj9C58
3/9/23, 12:31 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/7laeS6EDOvY?si=OQnZd9bUdK3Nqvx2
Sorry shared the wrong one
3/9/23, 12:44 pm - Jono: The only things I agreed with Robbie on here is 
A) Bruno is a moaning cunt 
B) Martinelli is by far a better footballer than Rashy
3/9/23, 1:16 pm - Gerrard: Wow
3/9/23, 1:20 pm - Jono: What’s the shock?

I’ve always been clear Martinelli is a baller (Klopp agrees)
And Bruno is a modern day hitler
3/9/23, 1:25 pm - Gerrard: Martinelli will be a gun but I never see him play, Arteta fuckin him
3/9/23, 1:25 pm - Jono: He’s started off a bit slow this season
3/9/23, 1:26 pm - Jono: Agree Arteta just needs to let him ball
3/9/23, 1:37 pm - Jono: @61422023136 did you guys not make the over 35 final?
3/9/23, 2:04 pm - Gerrard: Wow
3/9/23, 2:06 pm - Jono: Sore point?
3/9/23, 2:08 pm - Chris: The judgy tone of it. Hard to tell in text but that's what it looks like.
3/9/23, 2:10 pm - Jono: Gez always making a mountain out of a molehill
3/9/23, 2:14 pm - Gerrard: So it wasn't just me then
3/9/23, 2:20 pm - Chris: I don't thing jono meant for it to sound that way. Let's not go nuts here.
3/9/23, 2:25 pm - Jono: I was just genuinely asking as I saw a post from an o35 final that wasn’t Oran park
3/9/23, 2:25 pm - Gerrard: Lol
3/9/23, 2:31 pm - Pero: Nope unfortunetly not. We finished 1st with only 1 defeat. Then lost both semi's
3/9/23, 2:34 pm - Pero: Injuries fucked us
3/9/23, 2:44 pm - Jono: Ah damn that sucks
3/9/23, 2:46 pm - Chris: Damn, unlucky bro. You had a better season than me. You lost as many as we won 😆
3/9/23, 3:03 pm - Jono: There’s my Hungarian again
3/9/23, 3:03 pm - Jono: What did I tell ya
3/9/23, 3:04 pm - Chris: What a hit
3/9/23, 3:04 pm - Jono: Wtf was VAR looking at there
3/9/23, 3:04 pm - Jono: Just admiring how good the goal was probably
3/9/23, 3:05 pm - Chris: Salah offside but if they gave city the goal then they need consistency right....
3/9/23, 3:22 pm - Jono: Looked offside
3/9/23, 3:22 pm - Jono: Phew
3/9/23, 3:23 pm - Jono: We’re on fire
3/9/23, 3:23 pm - Gerrard: Old Nunez is BACK!
3/9/23, 3:23 pm - Gerrard: Loves a post
3/9/23, 3:23 pm - Jono: Just wanted to fuck all the twats who bought Cash after his points haul last week
3/9/23, 3:24 pm - Gerrard: But you see the difference between Salah with the ball and Diaz with the ball?
3/9/23, 3:25 pm - Jono: It’s hard to notice much when you’re so turned on by your teams performance
3/9/23, 3:25 pm - Jono: TMI apologies
3/9/23, 3:26 pm - Jono: Joel mate
3/9/23, 3:46 pm - Gerrard: ......
3/9/23, 3:46 pm - Gerrard: What's with Allison's hipster haircut?
3/9/23, 3:47 pm - Jono: George Michaelesque
3/9/23, 3:47 pm - Jono: Fast love era
3/9/23, 3:48 pm - Jono: CJ quality today
3/9/23, 3:53 pm - Gerrard: When did Villa change their crest?
3/9/23, 3:56 pm - Jono: Off season
3/9/23, 3:59 pm - Jono: Schmiechel trying passionately to convince people Salah was offside…. Shock horror
3/9/23, 4:01 pm - Jono: <Media omitted>
3/9/23, 4:09 pm - Gerrard: Nunez 🤣
3/9/23, 4:10 pm - Gerrard: He only scores against Newy
3/9/23, 4:10 pm - Jono: Haha that’s something I’d totally do
3/9/23, 4:10 pm - Jono: Trent’s long ball
3/9/23, 4:10 pm - Jono: Mamma mia
3/9/23, 4:16 pm - Dave: 3-0
3/9/23, 4:16 pm - Dave: What happened to villa, thought they’d do well this season
3/9/23, 4:17 pm - Jono: Backline decimated
3/9/23, 4:17 pm - Jono: And we’re back baby
3/9/23, 4:23 pm - Gerrard: Hey Nunez only scores against Newy
3/9/23, 4:33 pm - Gerrard: Havertz starting 😬
3/9/23, 4:34 pm - Jono: Hope TAA’s ok
3/9/23, 4:43 pm - Gerrard: These refs are rubbish
3/9/23, 4:43 pm - Gerrard: What is with the refs this year?
3/9/23, 4:44 pm - Jono: Howard Webb?
3/9/23, 4:44 pm - Jono: Didn’t he take over as head
3/9/23, 4:53 pm - Dave: Just happy they’ve got the normal back 4 again
3/9/23, 4:54 pm - Dave: Was dreading seeing partey playing as inverted right back. May as well have no one there defensively
3/9/23, 4:56 pm - Gerrard: You're safe for another week
3/9/23, 4:56 pm - Jono: Already 7 points ahead of the Toon
3/9/23, 4:57 pm - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
3/9/23, 4:57 pm - Gerrard: All hail

3/9/23, 4:59 pm - Gerrard: Fuck, Chelsea are above Newy
3/9/23, 5:57 pm - James: What a goal
3/9/23, 5:58 pm - James: *goals
3/9/23, 5:59 pm - Dave: What a goal…

4/9/23, 12:31 am - Dave: iPhone pro pro pro jumbo. Couldn’t sneak burnley in
4/9/23, 12:32 am - Jono: You should swap phones with @61452662705 so he feels better about his team

4/9/23, 1:36 am - Liam: Had a poor start to the season
4/9/23, 1:36 am - Liam: Scored a Worldie first game
4/9/23, 1:37 am - Liam: Hasn’t been great since
4/9/23, 2:32 am - Anthony: https://www.facebook.com/reel/1533540904051307?s=yWDuG2&fs=e&mibextid=Nif5oz
4/9/23, 2:35 am - James: Hello darkness my old friend
4/9/23, 2:53 am - Dave: <Media omitted>
4/9/23, 2:55 am - James: Bad isn't he
4/9/23, 3:16 am - Gerrard: Are we saying VARsenal after that United 2nd?
4/9/23, 3:18 am - Liam: Offside is offside
4/9/23, 3:22 am - Louie: It’s was close. If it weren’t for the Varchester claims in the Wolves game, VAR would have allowed that 😂
4/9/23, 3:24 am - Dave: You joking?
4/9/23, 3:24 am - Dave: Did you see the pen we missed out on earlier
4/9/23, 3:24 am - Liam: 100% pen
4/9/23, 3:25 am - Dave: Fucking joke
4/9/23, 3:25 am - Gerrard: Do you mean Havertz dive or another one?
4/9/23, 3:25 am - Gerrard: I heard they drew the line wrong
4/9/23, 3:25 am - Liam: Lucky it wasn’t a red. Took the poor kids legs out
4/9/23, 3:26 am - Dave: There was no shadow of a doubt that was a penalty
4/9/23, 3:26 am - Gerrard: But it was overturned, normally an overturn only happens with a clear and obvious error
4/9/23, 3:26 am - Dave: Pissed me right off that. The offside was close. If we’d got the pen and that was the equaliser I think they would have given the goal
4/9/23, 3:26 am - Liam: Did the ref call a pen?
Was there contact?
Was it clear and obvious?
4/9/23, 3:27 am - Dave: Did you watch it?
4/9/23, 3:27 am - Gerrard: Yeah saw the slow mo
4/9/23, 3:28 am - Dave: And what did you think? Honestly
4/9/23, 3:28 am - Gerrard: Havertz yellow card
4/9/23, 3:28 am - Dave: And bear in mind I totally agreed VVD wasn’t a red last weekend
4/9/23, 3:28 am - Gerrard: VVD was a red
4/9/23, 3:28 am - Dave: So let’s cut the shit for a second 😂
4/9/23, 3:29 am - Gerrard: I hate United
4/9/23, 3:29 am - Gerrard: Happy they lost
4/9/23, 3:29 am - Dave: ?? How, he got the ball
4/9/23, 3:29 am - Gerrard: But you gotta be honest
4/9/23, 3:30 am - Dave: I am being honest. That was a pen
4/9/23, 3:31 am - James: Arsenal cheat last night?
4/9/23, 3:31 am - Gerrard: I say a real man wouldn't have fallen over from a small nick just before VVD got the ball, but Isak sold it to the ref and then if the ref says it's a foul then it's a red as a goalscoring opportunity.
Liverpool didn't appeal it.
4/9/23, 3:31 am - James: Only saw first half
4/9/23, 3:31 am - Gerrard: Weird that you thought that.
4/9/23, 3:32 am - James: By going through the player 😂
4/9/23, 3:32 am - Gerrard: Everyone I've heard and my reaction was that the VAR then ref got it right
4/9/23, 3:32 am - James: If it wasn't a red dick van dyke would have played yesterday
4/9/23, 3:33 am - James: Varpool look better without him tbf
4/9/23, 3:34 am - Gerrard: Jimmy is piping up today because he's thought we've all moved on from the garbage fire that Newy is 🤣
We never forget.
4/9/23, 3:34 am - James: Ten Hag looking like he's on borrowed time
4/9/23, 3:34 am - Gerrard: Howie goes first
4/9/23, 3:34 am - James: Howe goes nowhere
4/9/23, 3:34 am - Gerrard: Beheaded and buried at the centre circle
4/9/23, 3:35 am - James: I will eagerly look forward to your fixtures away to Citeh and Brighton
4/9/23, 3:37 am - Jono: And Toon at Anfield
4/9/23, 3:38 am - Jono: Just watching the mini match now of Arsenal Mancs
4/9/23, 3:38 am - Jono: Gooners 1st goal.... miiiiint
4/9/23, 3:38 am - Jono: Ramsdale should've moved further across for Rashford's goal. Poor keeping... could easily have saved that
4/9/23, 3:39 am - James: How do you watch Europa League in aus?
4/9/23, 3:39 am - James: Varpool v LASK will be 🔥
4/9/23, 3:43 am - Jono: I'm just laughing at Schmeichel's reactions from the game. Especially after the embarrassing opinion that Szob's goal should've been an offside
4/9/23, 3:44 am - Jono: Newcastle remind me of the Socceroos - excited just to be at the World Cup
4/9/23, 3:44 am - Jono: Circa 2005
4/9/23, 3:45 am - Dave: Agree
4/9/23, 3:46 am - James: Varpool fans win a few games and they're given it the biggun. Awfully quiet when they don't win
4/9/23, 3:46 am - James: Would you like a wager
4/9/23, 3:47 am - James: I'll do it for the whole season. Howe still manager this time next season
4/9/23, 3:47 am - James: Low key self sledge. Like it
4/9/23, 3:47 am - Jono: Was the pen for Havertz given and then overturned?
4/9/23, 3:56 am - Dave: Howe will go before ten hag. I’d put money on that
4/9/23, 3:57 am - Dave: Yep
4/9/23, 3:57 am - Jono: Should’ve stayed a pen
4/9/23, 3:57 am - Jono: Not enough evidence to overturn it
4/9/23, 3:57 am - James: $100
4/9/23, 3:57 am - Dave: 🤝
4/9/23, 3:57 am - Jono: Though Kai did milk it
4/9/23, 3:57 am - Dave: Like any player would in the box
4/9/23, 3:58 am - Dave: Wreckless, they got away with murder there. Two of them sandwiching Havertz
4/9/23, 3:59 am - Dave: I love arsenal United, it’s always the most entertaining game of our season
4/9/23, 4:11 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
4/9/23, 4:12 am - Gerrard: Pot, kettle.
4/9/23, 4:13 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
4/9/23, 4:14 am - Gerrard: I thought it was Fulham at home
4/9/23, 4:15 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
4/9/23, 4:16 am - Jono: I thought Klopp was the only delusional manager ?
4/9/23, 4:17 am - Gerrard: They're all delusional
4/9/23, 4:17 am - Jono: Exactly
4/9/23, 4:18 am - Gerrard: Except for Howie, on the inside that hamster on the wheel fully understands what trouble he's in and is freaking out
4/9/23, 4:26 am - James: Ten Hag deffo more likeable than Flopp
4/9/23, 4:26 am - James: Less of a bitch
4/9/23, 4:48 am - Gerrard: Little fella still got some fight in him
4/9/23, 4:49 am - Gerrard: If Newy don't get a result against Brentford......
4/9/23, 4:52 am - James: I never go away. Unlike Varpool lads in here who disappear entirely last season...
4/9/23, 4:52 am - James: Don't ban me

4/9/23, 5:58 am - Jono: Just watched Bruno’s interview. Actually clean and measured. No complaints about the offside… I’m in shock. Ten Hag rattled clearly
4/9/23, 6:01 am - James: They got gifted the win vs wolves. Wolves smashed them and should have had a pen. Lost to spurs. Were 2-0 down at home to forest and only got back into it because of a red card and now lost to Arsenal
4/9/23, 6:01 am - James: He'll be gone by end of the year
4/9/23, 6:03 am - Chris: Was. There's a new king now. Not bad for a defender
4/9/23, 6:10 am - Dave: You see the comments
4/9/23, 6:10 am - Dave: Getting totally roasted by everyone

4/9/23, 6:22 am - Gerrard: Guys
4/9/23, 6:24 am - Gerrard: You wanted VAR to be better and when it does you criticise it, come on
4/9/23, 6:28 am - Liam: Implementation
4/9/23, 6:28 am - Liam: Contact
4/9/23, 6:29 am - Liam: Pen was giving by the ref
4/9/23, 6:29 am - Liam: Not clear and obvious
4/9/23, 6:29 am - Liam: Stick with the on field decision
4/9/23, 6:30 am - Liam: We just want consistency
4/9/23, 6:41 am - James: Like pen versus Newcastle last season
4/9/23, 6:41 am - James: Yeah like that pen last season
4/9/23, 6:43 am - James: Like Fergie
4/9/23, 6:43 am - James: He's perfect for them
4/9/23, 7:10 am - James: <Media omitted>
4/9/23, 7:14 am - Gerrard: Looks odd eh
4/9/23, 7:14 am - Dave: What’s odd?
4/9/23, 7:14 am - Gerrard: Looks like the lines were incorrectly done
4/9/23, 7:14 am - Dave: Clearly off. Gabby Masterclass
4/9/23, 7:14 am - James: Terrible defending either way
4/9/23, 7:15 am - James: Looks in line
4/9/23, 7:15 am - James: Very harsh
4/9/23, 7:15 am - Gerrard: I mean it's not as obvious as Havertz diving for a pen but ok
4/9/23, 7:16 am - Gerrard: I really do think Havertz should've got a yellow, no shittalk
4/9/23, 7:16 am - Dave: Can you draw a line on that photo so I can see how it’s done properly?
4/9/23, 7:16 am - Liam: If he did a salah And made more contact you would be saying pen
4/9/23, 7:17 am - Gerrard: Gimme that sentence again please sir
4/9/23, 7:17 am - James: Mugging you off @61478754484
4/9/23, 7:18 am - Gerrard: Honestly sounded like something missing to me
4/9/23, 7:18 am - James: Saying your a dyslexic spaz essentially
4/9/23, 7:18 am - James: *you're 😂
4/9/23, 7:18 am - Gerrard: I was being respectful about it Jimmy
4/9/23, 7:18 am - Liam: Respectful and polite
4/9/23, 7:18 am - James: Sounds patronising @61478754484
4/9/23, 7:19 am - James: Where's the automated offside thing
4/9/23, 7:19 am - Gerrard: Trying so hard to make us forget we all hate Newcastle together
4/9/23, 7:19 am - James: They use in CL
4/9/23, 7:20 am - James: Obsessed
4/9/23, 7:20 am - Dave: I had a disagreement with my liverpool mate at the pub today, got pretty heated. He said “liverpool are back and are going to title challenge, they’ll finish a minimum of 10 points clear of Arsenal and will get at least second” Thoughts?
4/9/23, 7:20 am - Liam: Havertz should of made more contact, if he did this it would look more like a pen. World class players do this, like salah.
4/9/23, 7:20 am - James: I'll get you next seasons Adidas strip @61409710717
4/9/23, 7:20 am - Gerrard: Pretty heated, how much saliva did you get on him?
4/9/23, 7:20 am - James: Or would you like this seasons one so you can have a shirt with a CL badge on it?
4/9/23, 7:20 am - Gerrard: And Szlob
4/9/23, 7:20 am - James: Saying Salah is a diver @61409710717
4/9/23, 7:20 am - Dave: Skipped the kissing, straight to shagging
4/9/23, 7:21 am - Gerrard: 😂
4/9/23, 7:21 am - James: They're so deluded
4/9/23, 7:21 am - James: 'we are back'
4/9/23, 7:21 am - Dave: He had a proper meltdown because I said “even liverpool”
4/9/23, 7:21 am - James: They 'were back' a lot last season too lols
4/9/23, 7:21 am - Gerrard: Again...... Pot, Kettle
4/9/23, 7:21 am - Dave: Triggered him
4/9/23, 7:21 am - James: Varpool fans get triggered so easy
4/9/23, 7:22 am - Dave: “Oh you think Arsenal are a better team than liverpool now because you’ve had one good season” 

Umm.. yes. That’s how it works. Lol
4/9/23, 7:22 am - James: Miles better 😂
4/9/23, 7:22 am - Dave: I was like, if liverpool beat us this season and finish above us.. guess what my little friend.. you’ll be the better team again 🤗
4/9/23, 7:22 am - James: Think they're the shit because some mong from Hungary scored a goal for them
4/9/23, 7:23 am - Dave: “But we’re better than you over 5 years”
4/9/23, 7:23 am - James: Apparently they're winning the title this season
4/9/23, 7:23 am - Dave: That wasn’t the debate lol
4/9/23, 7:23 am - James: They love the past. Did he talk about the trophies they won 60 years ago
4/9/23, 7:25 am - Dave: Actually yes.. started pointing at all the UCL stars on his shirt from the 70s
4/9/23, 7:25 am - James: How old is he
4/9/23, 7:25 am - Dave: 49
4/9/23, 7:25 am - James: Does he know about the Moore family? Unlike Jez
4/9/23, 7:25 am - Gerrard: Nah you gotta take a 5 yr average at least innit
4/9/23, 7:26 am - Gerrard: 😱
4/9/23, 7:26 am - James: He aware of how Varpool spend hundreds of millions in today's money back in the day to get them out of div 2
4/9/23, 7:26 am - Dave: He’s a real fan to be fair. Die hard. Goes down the liverpool pub every game at all hours of the morning and has a borderline aneurysm if you even question klopps tactics
4/9/23, 7:27 am - James: Jez doesn't even stay up for games from the comfort of his bed
4/9/23, 7:27 am - Gerrard: Dude I might need to change your name again to Pot, Kettle
4/9/23, 7:27 am - James: Less plasticy then fair play
4/9/23, 7:27 am - Gerrard: Toxic
4/9/23, 7:28 am - Dave: That wasn’t a swipe at you, don’t be so insecure
4/9/23, 7:28 am - James: @61409710717 Rodwell says you ain't a real fan
4/9/23, 7:28 am - James: Varpool fans are quite insecure tbf
4/9/23, 7:28 am - Gerrard: I'm calling your mate Toxic not you boo 😘
4/9/23, 7:28 am - Gerrard: I'm devo
4/9/23, 7:28 am - James: @61478754484 Jez saying you're a spacka and @14244893404 Jez saying you're toxic
4/9/23, 7:29 am - Gerrard: Scandal
4/9/23, 7:31 am - Gerrard: All fans should be able to participate in civic discourse in a polite and open manner while being confident in their point of view so much without letting others opinion affect their mental health.
One love.
4/9/23, 7:37 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/KN0W4PwqHD4?si=2viOwnrCNrdMNzEP
4/9/23, 8:06 am - Dave: Miss sitters
4/9/23, 8:22 am - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/shorts/YHeEaKtRxJ8?si=zBRRhi7DSUagPAZa
4/9/23, 8:36 am - James: Must be chuffed you bought Szlob instead of Mount
4/9/23, 8:37 am - James: Getting over £100m for Mount and Havertz is impressive
4/9/23, 10:01 am - Gerrard: Say what you will about Havertz and Arteta's choices, they're joint 2nd in the league
4/9/23, 10:05 am - Liam: 100% szlob looks like a great signing. Need to see more from Havertz, but we got to give him time.
4/9/23, 10:06 am - Gerrard: Patience is a virtue @61478754484, some toxic fans just react over each game like it's the end of the world and attack their players on twitter
4/9/23, 10:07 am - James: OK Havertz is shit
4/9/23, 10:07 am - Liam: Yes, he hasn’t been great.
4/9/23, 10:08 am - Liam: Only 4 games
4/9/23, 10:08 am - Gerrard: I would say Havertz has more wins with Arsenal than a certain Italian midfielder has at a certain club.
4/9/23, 10:09 am - Gerrard: You gotta win games to win titles, right, that's the main indicator, right?
4/9/23, 10:11 am - Liam: I just watched the Liverpool highlights. Klopp is a genius
4/9/23, 10:12 am - James: Only four games when it suits the topic of discussion
4/9/23, 10:12 am - James: Obsessed
4/9/23, 10:14 am - Liam: Ya individual player performances is a bit different to losing 3 of your first 4 league games.
4/9/23, 10:15 am - Liam: Trent solid, passing masterclass. 🤌🏼
4/9/23, 10:16 am - Gerrard: I think it's more worrying about HOW they lost
4/9/23, 10:18 am - James: So who's fault is it? Howe?
4/9/23, 10:18 am - James: Or individual players not performing or making mistakes
4/9/23, 10:19 am - Liam: Ya he’s the manager, that’s how this works.
4/9/23, 10:20 am - Jono: Acknowledging greatness. Well done Liam
4/9/23, 10:20 am - Jono: Feed him Liam
4/9/23, 10:20 am - James: I don't think that's exactly correct
4/9/23, 10:21 am - James: Liam going to start singing YNWA again 🤢
4/9/23, 10:21 am - Liam: New look midfield looks very impressive 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 king klopp 👑
4/9/23, 10:21 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
4/9/23, 10:21 am - Gerrard: Game recognises game
4/9/23, 10:22 am - Jono: Trent shoutout great too. He was ballin
4/9/23, 10:22 am - James: <Media omitted>
4/9/23, 10:24 am - Jono: Ramsdale also is 12 times the keeper Onana is
4/9/23, 10:25 am - Jono: The big fella was right to pick him over Onana
4/9/23, 10:25 am - Jono: In that combined 11
4/9/23, 10:26 am - Gerrard: I was about to say Saliba is on course to get up to prime VVD, like 2nd to Messi in the Ballon Dor vote VVD
4/9/23, 10:27 am - Gerrard: Sky's the limit
4/9/23, 10:27 am - Jono: Decent football too against 11 players. It’s funny how well good teams can play against 11.
4/9/23, 10:28 am - James: <Media omitted>
4/9/23, 10:28 am - Liam: If saliba becomes half the player VVD is…. I will be over the moon!
4/9/23, 10:28 am - Gerrard: And I'm so happy to see Marty O doing well, after those years wasted at Madrid, glad to see him fulfilling his potential - I wanted him at Liverpool back in the day.
4/9/23, 10:30 am - Gerrard: Hey three cheers for the Arsenal boys in here, glad you're out of those rough years and you're enjoying watching your team again.
4/9/23, 10:30 am - Jono: I’m naming my new dog Zinchenko
4/9/23, 10:31 am - Gerrard: Zinnie for a girl dog goes well
4/9/23, 10:33 am - Jono: Also appreciating praise on our Hungarian king 

2024 PFA player of the year
4/9/23, 10:33 am - Jono: @61409710717 I think it’s love
4/9/23, 10:35 am - Gerrard: I mean it is crazy how quickly he's integrated
4/9/23, 10:35 am - Gerrard: Just oozing talent
4/9/23, 10:35 am - Jono: Playing 90 minutes too
4/9/23, 10:36 am - Gerrard: Didn't look tired
4/9/23, 10:36 am - Jono: Unlike other big name transfers
4/9/23, 10:36 am - Jono: When the chips are down
4/9/23, 10:37 am - Gerrard: I think the manager has a lot to do with these types of things
4/9/23, 10:38 am - Gerrard: Communicating a clear identity for the team and how these new players fit into it
4/9/23, 11:25 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
4/9/23, 11:27 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
4/9/23, 12:11 pm - Jono: Big cock in the Forest
4/9/23, 12:18 pm - Pero: It'll be a good game when forrest play livo
4/9/23, 12:22 pm - Gerrard: Not a dry eye in sight
4/9/23, 12:31 pm - Jono: Just saw Havertz air swing 🤣🤣🤣
4/9/23, 12:31 pm - Jono: We’ve all been there
4/9/23, 12:49 pm - Pero: Yeh it was a doozy. I reckon he is the guy that kills it at training but match day pressure gets to him. Give him a bit more time he'll start to flow
4/9/23, 12:49 pm - Pero: Will Trent be the centre back now ? Suits him
4/9/23, 1:09 pm - Gerrard: We got Joey Gomez, a revelation last two games
4/9/23, 2:19 pm - Jono: <Media omitted>
4/9/23, 2:37 pm - Pero: Scumbag
4/9/23, 3:16 pm - Dave: Onana is becoming a bit of a liability, hasn’t had the best start has he
4/9/23, 3:17 pm - Dave: Think Saliba has all the ingredients to become a world class defender, he’s so good for his age. Also really rate timber as well so I’m excited to see what he does when he recovers
4/9/23, 3:22 pm - Dave: Agree, was saying this yesterday. Arteta wouldn’t be starting him if he was playing like this in training. Doesn’t help himself though does he, that air swing was paiiiiinful 😂
5/9/23, 12:19 am - Jono: Dropped from national team
5/9/23, 12:19 am - Jono: Man U incoming
5/9/23, 12:26 am - Louie: Our RW position is cursed
5/9/23, 1:11 am - Chris: Nah, it's just the type of player that wants to play for utd.
5/9/23, 1:12 am - Chris: 100% Bruno has done it too. Just hasn't come out yet
5/9/23, 1:15 am - Gerrard: Bruno couldn't beat a fly, pissweak
5/9/23, 1:32 am - Dave: Nonce more his thing?
5/9/23, 1:32 am - Dave: Bruno could be stood outside the school gates with his wanger out and United would find a way of defending him
5/9/23, 1:47 am - Chris: Happy bday @61409710717
5/9/23, 1:47 am - Gerrard: Thanks bruva

5/9/23, 5:58 am - Dave: Right, imagine if he hadn’t pulled it off. Such a big brain move under pressure, knew in that split second he wasn’t going to be able to track back and set up the trap
5/9/23, 6:08 am - Gerrard: I think he reacted too late
5/9/23, 6:09 am - Gerrard: But good thing VAR has the slower frame rates
5/9/23, 6:12 am - Dave: Should have done a vvd and swiped garnacho’s legs?
5/9/23, 6:12 am - Gerrard: Hey man gotta do what a man's gotta do

5/9/23, 9:57 am - Jono: Gez what’s the ceiling to respect his achievements?
5/9/23, 9:57 am - Jono: Out of curiosity
5/9/23, 10:17 am - Gerrard: What is with you not understanding this when I say it?
I don't like him as a human being.
5/9/23, 10:17 am - Gerrard: Why do you keep drawing lines between this and his skills as a manager?
5/9/23, 10:23 am - Jono: I’ve never heard you say you respect his achievements
5/9/23, 10:24 am - Jono: So I just asked what it would take
5/9/23, 10:24 am - Jono: DW I’m just yanking your chain
5/9/23, 10:25 am - Jono: 🫶🏽

6/9/23, 6:20 am - Gerrard: This morning
6/9/23, 6:52 am - James: Jez following the U21s now?

6/9/23, 7:07 am - James: <Media omitted>
6/9/23, 7:07 am - James: Salford as well. Gaz Neville
6/9/23, 7:07 am - Dave: Got some top talent coming up through the ranks then
6/9/23, 7:08 am - James: Legitimately heard 'we are back' from the mouth of an Irish lad to my scouse mate at work today
6/9/23, 7:08 am - James: Tbf he replied 'wait till the end of the season before you say that'
6/9/23, 7:09 am - James: Then he ruined that bit of common sense by saying to me he thinks Varpool finish second this season
6/9/23, 7:10 am - Dave: I heard that more than once on Sunday. Got told “Arsenal are shit and liverpool and city are in a different league of their own”
6/9/23, 7:11 am - Dave: No different to saying Newcastle are fucked now and Eddie’s going to be sacked I guess. We’re all as delusional as each other
6/9/23, 7:12 am - Jono: Balon D'or for the Hungarian
6/9/23, 7:12 am - Jono: Into 1 or trophies
6/9/23, 7:12 am - Jono: 1 or 2
6/9/23, 7:12 am - James: Some way more vocal than others though. I had to tell him that's why all other fan bases hate you. Because it's just constant delusion
6/9/23, 7:13 am - James: A lot of entitlement too
6/9/23, 7:13 am - Jono: Speaking of delusion
6/9/23, 7:13 am - James: You still confident Ten Hag out stays Howe?
6/9/23, 7:13 am - Jono: <Media omitted>
6/9/23, 7:14 am - Dave: I didn’t realise how bad ten hags away record was, it’s fucking woeful. United get their pants ripped down by every big club
6/9/23, 7:14 am - James: Doesn't qualify as delusion. Newcastle are in the CL and a champs league team. I'd say it's more just stupid
6/9/23, 7:14 am - Dave: I think he’ll go before howe
6/9/23, 7:14 am - James: Lost all away to top 9?
6/9/23, 7:15 am - James: But they beat everyone below
6/9/23, 7:15 am - Dave: <Media omitted>

6/9/23, 7:16 am - Dave: <Media omitted>
6/9/23, 7:16 am - James: Liverpools ref
6/9/23, 7:17 am - James: He's from wirral
6/9/23, 7:17 am - James: Done us over at anfield last season. Whole family are scousers
6/9/23, 7:17 am - James: And after his 'helping a mate' comments about Chelsea, Spurs last season I'd say it's deffo something to do with it
6/9/23, 7:18 am - James: It was Howard Webb who was a manc wasn't it?
6/9/23, 7:18 am - Dave: Always thought he was in bed with United
6/9/23, 7:19 am - Dave: Ahhhh that’s who I’m getting mixed up with
6/9/23, 7:19 am - James: Nah Mike Dean is a bin dipper
6/9/23, 7:19 am - Dave: Regardless, ten hag has officials coming out and speaking out against his bullshit rants. This is good
6/9/23, 7:20 am - Dave: A mate of mine reckons hag is next on the list as well. Said when managers start bitching about players publicly it’s usually when they’ve had a talking to from the owners
6/9/23, 7:20 am - Jono: I've had Manc fans tell me this is all Klopp's fault because he bitched about Mancs getting the rub of the green
6/9/23, 7:20 am - Jono: And it has nothing to do with the team at all
6/9/23, 7:21 am - Dave: Always comes back to Klopp,
He’s the root of all evil
6/9/23, 7:21 am - Jono: I said the exact thing to the Manc mate who cried Klopp
6/9/23, 7:22 am - Jono: It never ends well when there's a player calling out the manager's accusation
6/9/23, 7:22 am - James: https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/van-dijk-liverpool-premier-league-30872300
6/9/23, 7:22 am - Jono: They're in such denial that their inconsistency is form based
6/9/23, 7:24 am - Jono: Phew thought he'd get more weeks
6/9/23, 7:24 am - Jono: Not that we need him when Go-Go-Gomez and Matip are bossin it

6/9/23, 7:26 am - James: <Media omitted>
6/9/23, 7:27 am - James: Doesn't Henderson come above Gerrrard in the 'best captain' ranks because he won a title and a CL?
6/9/23, 7:27 am - Jono: "How you eh..say, rape, in eh-spanish?"
6/9/23, 7:27 am - James: That's a genuine question Jono?
6/9/23, 7:27 am - James: They don't mind that stuff and racism. It's all good
6/9/23, 7:28 am - Dave: The PR campaign has started with the dirty rapist. Seen all the pro Greenwood videos popping up on my timelines. United want him back
6/9/23, 7:28 am - James: He's on loan
6/9/23, 7:28 am - James: They didn't even get rid of him
6/9/23, 7:28 am - Dave: I know, still paying 20% of his wages
6/9/23, 7:29 am - Jono: Best captains apply to more than trophies... "Most successful" i would say yeah Hendo.
Stevie was the 'best' captain though
6/9/23, 7:29 am - Jono: in the PL era
6/9/23, 7:29 am - Dave: Hendo needs to shut the fuck up and collect his bag. “Oh no one wanted me at liverpool” 🙄🙄🙄 The £700k a week had nothing to do with it
6/9/23, 7:30 am - Dave: Klopp is the most loyal manager in the prem, he would have played hendo until his fucking legs dropped off
6/9/23, 7:30 am - Dave: Milner was about to take his pension and still got regular game time
6/9/23, 7:30 am - James: Comes across like a nob. Have you heard Toneys interview on that podcast?
6/9/23, 7:30 am - Jono: Yeah Hendo has really fucked himself here PR wise
6/9/23, 7:30 am - James: Toney comes across like a twat
6/9/23, 7:30 am - James: Still doesn't own up to anything
6/9/23, 7:31 am - James: And pleads ignorance 😂
6/9/23, 7:31 am - Dave: He’s chatting total pony and needs to just accept he’s a money hungry cunt and has thrown away all his supposed morals for some tax free cash
6/9/23, 7:31 am - James: Respect
6/9/23, 7:31 am - Jono: Hendo's quote above takes Klopp's reference completely out of context to a journo question asking Klopp if he could've done better with incomings this transfer window
6/9/23, 7:32 am - James: If you say yeah I'm happy with the transfer window it can be spun as 'I'm happy we sold Henderson'
6/9/23, 7:32 am - Jono: And lets be real, of course Klopp is happier with a midfield that doesn't have an average age of around 30
6/9/23, 7:33 am - James: Still don't believe Fabinho isn't at least 40
6/9/23, 7:33 am - Jono: Based on how Klopp plays - its impossible to generate the work rate from players 30 or above. Unless they're bionic like Salah, CR, Messi etc
6/9/23, 7:33 am - Dave: Think he realises that and is scrambling on the back foot. No one cares if he’s just honest and says “yeah, I took the golden handshake contract, big dogs gotta eat” 

Instead of all this shite about how he’s going to make a difference in Saudi. Try wearing your 🌈 armband out there and report back to us
6/9/23, 7:34 am - Dave: Do you think salah is gone by Jan window? Heard Saudi offering 200m+ now
6/9/23, 7:35 am - Jono: Not January - I'm fairly certain a deal will be struck for him to leave at end of season
6/9/23, 7:36 am - Jono: And from there we buy a player not long after to come in from next summer too
6/9/23, 7:36 am - Jono: We'd struggle to replace him in January
6/9/23, 7:36 am - Jono: Not that his replaceable anyway
6/9/23, 7:36 am - James: I heard they just bid £250m
6/9/23, 7:38 am - James: 'make a difference' 😂 he wouldn't dare wear that rainbow armband or laces let alone talk about the gay community to the Saudis

6/9/23, 7:57 am - Gerrard: I hear someone say he didn't feel wanted - after Klopp argued with the club to get him resigned last year
6/9/23, 7:57 am - Gerrard: Not wanted though
6/9/23, 7:59 am - Gerrard: A lot of add-ons, like that Arsenal meme for Rice.
If they win the Club World Cup.
6/9/23, 8:01 am - Dave: Would be taking a trip up to the top of “gay mountain”

7/9/23, 1:28 pm - James: I question the timing of the transfer. Why didn't they just sign him at the start of the summer 🤔

9/9/23, 2:08 pm - Gerrard: @61404060785 I know what to get you for your birthday
9/9/23, 2:09 pm - Jono: Go on

9/9/23, 2:10 pm - Gerrard: Make it a Christmas pressie
9/9/23, 2:11 pm - Jono: Nuh the jumper from the other day is better. Such a dreamy face

10/9/23, 6:47 am - Dave: Hendo should have picked him up as well. Shit show from players that shouldn’t have been in the squad. Another southgate special
10/9/23, 6:51 am - Gerrard: I feel bad for you guys, at least United fans could get rid of him
10/9/23, 6:53 am - Gerrard: You guys are two sacking from getting him out of your lives
10/9/23, 6:53 am - Gerrard: *sacking
10/9/23, 6:53 am - Gerrard: *sackings
10/9/23, 6:53 am - Dave: Maguire isn’t the problem. Its old Gareth. Blows my mind the FA are still backing him. He’s literally beaten no one. We’ve been gifted the easiest runs the past 3 comps and every time we’ve played a traditionally big side, we crumbled due to Southgates wank tactics
10/9/23, 6:55 am - Gerrard: You've mulled over a few times I see
10/9/23, 6:55 am - Gerrard: *over this

10/9/23, 6:57 am - Dave: I just don’t get how he hasn’t been found out. Been saying this for years and today was the first time I’ve seen people starting to properly turn on him. Legends of the game speaking out about his bizarre decisions and comments
10/9/23, 6:58 am - Gerrard: I believe it's the lluminati
10/9/23, 6:59 am - Gerrard: They need the English people to stay unhappy and depressed as they're worried the Empire could make a resurgence
10/9/23, 7:12 am - James: Why is anti gay still in the team
10/9/23, 7:15 am - Dave: He was dog shit today. Can tell he’s been playing against farmers
10/9/23, 7:23 am - Gerrard: Another Southgate masterclass decision
10/9/23, 7:24 am - Gerrard: Took a backhander from FIP

10/9/23, 9:13 am - Chris: It's only because if ali was in then it wouldn't be a competition.
10/9/23, 9:25 am - James: It's disgraceful Ramsdale was nominated
10/9/23, 9:26 am - James: Varpool would have been 10th without Alissson
11/9/23, 12:49 am - Dave: To be fair, not hard to pad out Alissons stats with that leaky defence of yours. Poor cunt was getting peppered the entire season
11/9/23, 12:52 am - James: Goals prevented stat 🤯
11/9/23, 12:53 am - James: He'll do well in Saudi
11/9/23, 12:55 am - Dave: Well that’s what I mean. If you’re getting hammered every game you’re going to *prevent more goals*
11/9/23, 12:56 am - Dave: Like Pickford, poor lad spends half the game pulling the ball out the back of the net but my god, his stats look outstanding
11/9/23, 12:57 am - James: Same as ball winning midfielders or no 6s. Look better when they play for shit teams who don't have the ball much 💃
11/9/23, 12:57 am - James: He's started the season strong again
11/9/23, 12:59 am - Dave: Oh he’s class. Still best keeper in the league imo
11/9/23, 1:00 am - Dave: But playing for liverpool is a stat padder
11/9/23, 1:02 am - Dave: I’m guessing Ederson should be playing in league one then. What a shit keeper!! 😂😂😂
11/9/23, 1:02 am - James: I wonder why a more successful club hasn't come in for him. One that has more of a chance of winning major trophies. <This message was edited>

12/9/23, 10:58 pm - Jono: Referencing a friendly almost as bad as Gez referencing an U21s game
12/9/23, 11:00 pm - Dave: On the decline unfortunately, was good a couple of years ago
12/9/23, 11:00 pm - Dave: Southgate 101 again. Super sub Maguire for a world class own goal
12/9/23, 11:03 pm - James: Scotland v England is never a friendly
12/9/23, 11:03 pm - James: Downfall started just before he got schooled with the elbow by that assistant ref

13/9/23, 5:47 am - Dave: Liverpool fans be like… Na that doesn’t count back then - unless we’re talking about trophies. Then you can all count my champions league stars on my shirt from the 70s
13/9/23, 10:26 am - Gerrard: It's all mindgames Bob
13/9/23, 10:27 am - Gerrard: Good to see the English still hating on Liverpool in here

16/9/23, 5:17 pm - Pero: Danny W sticking it back to them
16/9/23, 5:18 pm - Dave: Aren’t they title challenging anymore?
16/9/23, 5:22 pm - Jono: I’m particularly pleased as most Manc fans have found a way to blame Klopp for their bad start due to ref bias through his complaints last season
16/9/23, 5:22 pm - Jono: What a club
16/9/23, 5:26 pm - Jono: Hope someone breaks Hannibal’s leg
16/9/23, 5:48 pm - Jono: Love the United fans were all about to leave and hung around  after they scored only to watch 10 minutes of their shite
16/9/23, 5:48 pm - Jono: Minutes more*
16/9/23, 5:51 pm - Dave: Brighton dominating at old Trafford
16/9/23, 5:51 pm - Dave: Imagine telling Ferguson that ten years ago
16/9/23, 5:52 pm - Dave: What a time to be alive
16/9/23, 5:53 pm - Dave: Did big Ange just collect his manager of the month award and decide to press the reset button?
16/9/23, 5:53 pm - Jono: The Spurs august MOTM curse continues
16/9/23, 5:54 pm - Jono: 3rd manager now

17/9/23, 2:45 am - James: That Onana is poo. Should have kept De Gea
17/9/23, 2:45 am - Dave: “If only the glazers would back the managers”
17/9/23, 2:45 am - James: Thought Ten Hag was awesome?
17/9/23, 2:46 am - Dave: I heard ten hag was an elite manager and eras come to an end??
17/9/23, 2:47 am - James: First time? What about keeping two wife beaters on the books?
17/9/23, 2:48 am - Dave: My mate just text me saying ten hag has demanded sancho make a public apology to him if he ever wants to play for United again?! Is this true 😂😂

18/9/23, 3:35 pm - Dave: Hate to say it because I like Rammers but Raya is quality, felt so much more comfortable with him in goal. A lot better at collecting those crosses and high balls. Can’t hurt having two great keepers fighting for their spot 🤷🏼‍♂️
18/9/23, 3:46 pm - Gerrard: 😱
18/9/23, 3:46 pm - Gerrard: Feels like when youse turned on Wenger again
18/9/23, 4:30 pm - Dave: Have to get the balance of loyalty right. Otherwise you end up with a manager begging 38 year olds to sign another 4 year contract 🤷🏼‍♂️
18/9/23, 4:55 pm - Gerrard: You're reaching like James mate lol
18/9/23, 4:55 pm - Dave: Would you have Ramsdale at Liverpool?

18/9/23, 10:17 pm - Dave: I give Arsenal a 3% chance this season 🥰
18/9/23, 10:18 pm - Dave: We just have to hope Pep takes up heroine
18/9/23, 10:19 pm - Dave: @61452662705 why am I hearing  rumours that Barcelona are replacing lewandowski with Isak?
18/9/23, 10:19 pm - Jono: Isak can’t even make the starting line up for the mid table toon
18/9/23, 10:21 pm - Dave: Ouch
18/9/23, 10:22 pm - Gerrard: Too modest
18/9/23, 10:24 pm - Gerrard: Hilarious that Chelsea and United are getting raked for having 5/6pts while Newcastle are ok 6pts and no one is mentioning anything because that's exactly where they should be 🤣
18/9/23, 10:24 pm - Gerrard: *on 6pts

18/9/23, 11:42 pm - Jono: Might as well just take severed heads to games
18/9/23, 11:42 pm - Dave: They don’t know the rules because they’ve never been before 🥺😢
18/9/23, 11:43 pm - Jono: Their fans are slip n sliding on concrete in Milan in torrential rain
18/9/23, 11:52 pm - James: Our prince can't control the weather 🇸🇦
18/9/23, 11:58 pm - James: Who's Varpool got on Thursday?

19/9/23, 12:16 am - Dave: 7 years*
19/9/23, 12:17 am - Jono: Got an easy one this week. Four letters 

LASK
19/9/23, 12:18 am - Dave: Arsenal hold club record for being most consistent champions league contenders in England* 

19 consecutive tournaments competing is better than a title to be honest
19/9/23, 12:19 am - Jono: You mean consecutive European competition participants?
19/9/23, 12:26 am - James: Varpool record for top four finishes is pathetic considering how big they proclaim to be
19/9/23, 12:30 am - Jono: Again, this reminds me of Australia glorifying making the World Cup
19/9/23, 12:30 am - Jono: We all know how high our ceilings are I suppose
19/9/23, 12:30 am - Dave: UCL
19/9/23, 12:31 am - Dave: 1998-2017
19/9/23, 12:32 am - Jono: Great achievement
19/9/23, 12:32 am - Jono: Shame they didn’t win one
19/9/23, 12:38 am - James: Can't all get the luck of a pandemic and facing spurs in a final
19/9/23, 12:42 am - Jono: In all honesty though I’d enjoy seeing this current Arsenal squad giving it a nudge in Europe. Can’t see it happening but would be preferenced over a predictable winner
19/9/23, 12:53 am - Dave: Like the England teams fixture schedules the past three tournaments, but klopp actually knows how to win
19/9/23, 2:55 am - James: <Media omitted>

19/9/23, 7:02 am - Dave: Was that when you came back from a 4-0 aggregate against Barca?
19/9/23, 7:05 am - James: What happened last season in the CL?
19/9/23, 7:05 am - James: I remember Napoli and Real Madrid games
19/9/23, 7:05 am - James: Lots of goals
19/9/23, 7:05 am - James: For them
19/9/23, 7:06 am - James: That hair is holding on isn't it. Reckon it'll be gone by seasons end?

19/9/23, 2:46 pm - Gerrard: Poor cunt, let him go home
19/9/23, 4:03 pm - Gerrard: Imagine he does a runner after the game in Milan, like those Iraqi footballers after that Socceroos match in Australia
19/9/23, 5:05 pm - Dave: Do the Subway Socceroos only play war torn countries and tropical islands to improve their global rankings?
19/9/23, 5:06 pm - Gerrard: You're sounding very English by talking down on smaller nations.
This Is England stuff.
19/9/23, 5:09 pm - Dave: I feel Australian yesterday when I liked big Ange’s press conferences 

Today, I feel English
19/9/23, 5:10 pm - Gerrard: Romper Stomper to This Is England in 24hrs, amazing

19/9/23, 11:53 pm - Dave: I remember how comforting this group was when England lost the euros final ❤️
19/9/23, 11:54 pm - Dave: Did well to get a point there. I just looked at the stats lol
19/9/23, 11:57 pm - James: Watch highlights. Pot shots from outside the area. They had one clear header second half. Only real save was their keeper last minute
20/9/23, 12:07 am - James: I remember getting banned
20/9/23, 2:58 am - James: Anyone here going to watch LASK Linz vs Liverpool?
20/9/23, 3:21 am - Jono: <Media omitted>

You watched your mob in the championship yeah?
20/9/23, 3:31 am - Jono: Swings and roundabouts - will be fun to watch and see what team is out there. Guessing he'll rest a number of stars.
20/9/23, 3:43 am - James: Every championship club would beat LASK 5-0
20/9/23, 3:43 am - James: Nah Flopp said Europa is the same as CL
20/9/23, 3:44 am - Jono: English delusion and ignorance strikes yet again
20/9/23, 3:46 am - Jono: He'll play a decent forward line minus Salah imo
Mids rotation (Elliot, Endo and the new Dutchie)
Backs probs Virgil back and rest Robbo & Matip
20/9/23, 3:51 am - James: Sounds like excuses already

20/9/23, 6:25 am - James: Would you be disappointed if Arsenal fell into that riff raff competition @14244893404
20/9/23, 6:25 am - James: All the shit teams in it atm. Gets better when CL teams go in
20/9/23, 6:26 am - James: I'd rather not be in Europe at all tbh. CL only
20/9/23, 6:34 am - Dave: 100%. Europa is just a distraction from league campaign. I hated it last year when I was delusional enough to think we had a slim chance of winning the league
20/9/23, 6:44 am - James: Harder to go all the way in the Caraboo Cup than Europa
20/9/23, 7:01 am - Dave: Ah fuck that, I’d rather win Europa than carabao
20/9/23, 7:02 am - Jono: Hammers seemed pretty happy with the conference league
20/9/23, 7:02 am - Dave: At least your champions of Europe
20/9/23, 7:02 am - Dave: Just second tier champions of the shit teams of Europe 😂
20/9/23, 7:09 am - Jono: Guarantee Geordies would close the city down and parade the team if they won Europa
20/9/23, 7:10 am - Jono: We did it for Cup double which I agree was embarrassing but I think they had no choice but to run with it given they booked Calvin Harris 🤣
20/9/23, 8:35 am - Gerrard: Even Newy?
20/9/23, 8:36 am - Gerrard: Should've won it
20/9/23, 12:15 pm - Shaun: Tonne of people with Berlin jerseys on the Madrid train

21/9/23, 12:10 am - Jono: <Media omitted>
21/9/23, 1:35 am - James: Varpool 'fan' calling manure a real team.
21/9/23, 1:56 am - Jono: Must’ve been on some dodgy Croatian acid
21/9/23, 1:58 am - James: I think that's just 24/7 judging by his general football takes overall
21/9/23, 8:30 am - Dave: <Media omitted>
21/9/23, 8:35 am - James: You being racist

21/9/23, 4:20 pm - Dave: Grinning like a Cheshire Cat
21/9/23, 6:48 pm - Gerrard: Super racist
21/9/23, 6:48 pm - Gerrard: <Media omitted>

21/9/23, 7:05 pm - Gerrard: Nunez only scores against Newy
21/9/23, 7:23 pm - Dave: Are you losing to LASK 😂😂😂😂
21/9/23, 7:36 pm - Gerrard: Good hit to be fair
21/9/23, 7:36 pm - Gerrard: Playing well but might be time to get the big boys on
21/9/23, 7:37 pm - Gerrard: Also for the record, I detest zonal marking on set pieces
21/9/23, 7:40 pm - Dave: Are the big boys not on now?
21/9/23, 7:41 pm - Gerrard: Diaz Konate VVD on
21/9/23, 7:41 pm - Gerrard: Nunez if you feel like counting him lol
21/9/23, 7:41 pm - Gerrard: He's started a DM at RB too
21/9/23, 7:41 pm - Dave: Your starting line up is on apart from alisson Robbo and Trent no?
21/9/23, 7:42 pm - Dave: I guess no slob
21/9/23, 7:42 pm - Gerrard: The whole midfield is second string, RB and LB, GK is the backup.
Playing a reserve kid in place of Salah.
21/9/23, 7:43 pm - Dave: Got you
21/9/23, 7:43 pm - Dave: You think Klopp is throwing the game?
21/9/23, 7:43 pm - Gerrard: They playing ok, just not getting shots on

21/9/23, 7:43 pm - Gerrard: Nunez had a header off the line
21/9/23, 7:43 pm - Gerrard: Some blocked shots
21/9/23, 7:44 pm - Dave: Such an “almost” striker isn’t he. He’s got to have the highest percentage of line saves and woodwork shots in the prem <This message was edited>
21/9/23, 7:44 pm - Gerrard: Shearer loves him
21/9/23, 7:44 pm - Dave: He’s got it all except for putting the ball in the back of the net 😂😂
21/9/23, 7:45 pm - Gerrard: Only against Newy
21/9/23, 7:45 pm - Dave: Like a handicapped Halaand
21/9/23, 7:45 pm - Gerrard: Fucking fast though
21/9/23, 7:45 pm - Gerrard: Slob and Salah on please
21/9/23, 7:46 pm - Gerrard: Gravenburger looks good though
21/9/23, 7:46 pm - Dave: That’s what I mean
21/9/23, 7:47 pm - Dave: Strength, speed, exploits gaps really well and causes huge issues for back lines. Just fucks most shots when he’s in front of goal
21/9/23, 7:50 pm - Gerrard: Can only score bangers against Newy
21/9/23, 7:54 pm - Gerrard: Think I'm gonna give up watching football if it's gonna be park the bus every game, I'll just watch the big games
21/9/23, 7:55 pm - Gerrard: When's Livo v Arsenal?
21/9/23, 7:57 pm - Gerrard: Omg he's taking a pen

21/9/23, 8:32 pm - Gerrard: Not worth just seeing your boys
21/9/23, 8:41 pm - Dave: You going to stop off in LA on way back to Sydney? May as well have a layover here. Break up trip, it’s on the way
21/9/23, 8:44 pm - Gerrard: I don't visit 3rd world countries
21/9/23, 8:44 pm - Gerrard: Everyone better score their goals against Livo in the first half
21/9/23, 8:44 pm - Gerrard: 2nd half kings lol
21/9/23, 8:52 pm - Gerrard: <Media omitted>

21/9/23, 9:33 pm - Gerrard: *you tell me
21/9/23, 9:34 pm - Gerrard: Tam says east coast USA and Canada was shantytowns and junkies shooting up in the streets
21/9/23, 9:34 pm - Gerrard: They go where the weather is better so they don't freeze to death at night
21/9/23, 9:36 pm - Dave: California alone has double the GDP of Australia. 

No such thing as a homeless person in LA because taxpayers money is so well utilised
21/9/23, 9:36 pm - Gerrard: A shot at his adopted homeland now, @61478754484 , he's changed
21/9/23, 9:37 pm - Dave: Yeah, make they all make their way down here. Homeless paradise

22/9/23, 3:13 am - James: Jesus that was bad
22/9/23, 3:29 am - Jono: As bad as Bruno G vs Liverpool?
22/9/23, 3:30 am - Chris: That was bad. He looked gassed before kick off.
22/9/23, 4:03 am - Louie: He’s not the only one with this attitude
22/9/23, 4:33 am - James: <Media omitted>
22/9/23, 4:34 am - Jono: I sometimes think that CBS show just stage lines like that to go viral
22/9/23, 4:34 am - Jono: They do it so much
22/9/23, 4:34 am - Jono: Funny mob

24/9/23, 3:51 pm - Gerrard: Stop saying things like this
24/9/23, 3:56 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 how's the Arsenal going?
24/9/23, 3:57 pm - Dave: Look a bit tired to be honest. Definitely the better team and had some great chances, but not capitalising on spurs mistakes and looked a bit sloppy at times
24/9/23, 3:57 pm - Dave: Arsenal for 90% of last season would have decimated this spurs side by now
24/9/23, 3:57 pm - Gerrard: I saw Saka mocking Madison during his goal celebration
24/9/23, 3:58 pm - Gerrard: But which is the true Arsenal, the 90 or the 10?

24/9/23, 3:59 pm - Gerrard: Poor form
24/9/23, 4:00 pm - Jono: They’re close mates apparently
24/9/23, 4:00 pm - Jono: But still
24/9/23, 4:01 pm - Gerrard: Poor form celebrating an own goal like that
24/9/23, 4:01 pm - Jono: In other news Chelsea are still absolute dog shit
24/9/23, 4:01 pm - Gerrard: It's 0-0
24/9/23, 4:02 pm - Gerrard: Can you please stop jinxing shit
24/9/23, 4:02 pm - Jono: Been watching it - Villa will win

24/9/23, 5:04 pm - Jono: Never were tbh… city will smoke the rest
24/9/23, 5:04 pm - Dave: Whatever slight chance we had, was decimated today 😂
24/9/23, 5:05 pm - Jono: We’re just watching the battle for 2nd
24/9/23, 5:05 pm - Dave: I would have given us a ~3% chance before the season started 😂
24/9/23, 5:06 pm - Dave: We’ll just have to win the champions league 🙄

24/9/23, 11:34 pm - Dave: Shit game
24/9/23, 11:34 pm - James: Not going to challenge this season then
24/9/23, 11:35 pm - James: 'challenge'
24/9/23, 11:35 pm - Gerrard: Own goal assist and a pen?
24/9/23, 11:35 pm - James: Spurs better side?
24/9/23, 11:35 pm - James: Stats indicate that
24/9/23, 11:47 pm - Gerrard: You guys are gonna kill the Championship next year
24/9/23, 11:48 pm - James: Spurs away is it next?
24/9/23, 11:48 pm - James: Wheels will be coming off
24/9/23, 11:52 pm - Gerrard: Poor Howie

25/9/23, 2:26 am - James: <Media omitted>
25/9/23, 2:35 am - Dave: He had a great game. Shame to see him come off, Jorginho mistake cost us 3 points
25/9/23, 2:35 am - Jono: He was garbage hey (Rice)
25/9/23, 2:36 am - Jono: Lol
25/9/23, 2:36 am - Dave: You’re awfully chatty after beating a championship team @61452662705
25/9/23, 2:36 am - James: Easy to blame Jorginho init
25/9/23, 2:36 am - James: Typical
25/9/23, 2:36 am - Jono: I dunno I thought he wasn’t offering up much
25/9/23, 2:36 am - James: Won't blame anyone else
25/9/23, 2:36 am - Dave: Today was on Arteta
25/9/23, 2:36 am - Jono: So makes sense he had a niggle
25/9/23, 2:36 am - Dave: Not rice <This message was edited>
25/9/23, 2:36 am - James: Not good enough?
25/9/23, 2:37 am - James: Arteta out?
25/9/23, 2:37 am - Dave: Behave
25/9/23, 2:37 am - James: Can't be playing like that against spurs
25/9/23, 2:37 am - James: We beat them 6-1
25/9/23, 2:37 am - Dave: Everyone had an off day. We looked dominant first 20 mins
25/9/23, 2:37 am - Jono: Probably went too hard on Wednesday night
25/9/23, 2:37 am - James: Against psv?
25/9/23, 2:37 am - Jono: Need to ease up a bit
25/9/23, 2:38 am - Dave: Then I don’t know what happened, Eddie was on the pitch way too long. Should have come off, looked so shit. Arteta took Jesus off and brought Nelson on rather than Eddie off
25/9/23, 2:38 am - Dave: Odegaard was totally MIA today
25/9/23, 2:38 am - James: Humbled? @61404060785?
25/9/23, 2:39 am - Dave: Eddie isn’t good enough full stop
25/9/23, 2:39 am - James: I haven't seen the match yet
25/9/23, 2:39 am - Dave: Definitely looked tired, clearly not used to playing European football anymore
25/9/23, 2:39 am - James: Blaming Eddie now
25/9/23, 2:39 am - Dave: Should have enough depth though
25/9/23, 2:39 am - Dave: I don’t know
25/9/23, 2:39 am - Dave: Rough game
25/9/23, 2:39 am - Jono: It’s a marathon not a sprint 

Arsenal getting their dicks wet hearing the UCL anthem
25/9/23, 2:39 am - James: Always the unsexy names get the bashing
25/9/23, 2:39 am - Jono: And eyes not on the prize yday
25/9/23, 2:39 am - James: How was havertz
25/9/23, 2:39 am - James: Great signing him
25/9/23, 2:40 am - Dave: I thought he was great
25/9/23, 2:40 am - James: Great player
25/9/23, 2:40 am - Dave: Had a good game
25/9/23, 2:40 am - Jono: Played well but still can’t shoot
25/9/23, 2:40 am - Dave: And had a good game in internationals and against PSV
25/9/23, 2:40 am - James: It's a race for four positions 2-5
25/9/23, 2:46 am - Dave: Brighton, arsenal, liverpool and spurs battling it out
25/9/23, 2:46 am - James: As if Saka celebrates that OG
25/9/23, 2:46 am - James: Good to see him humbled
25/9/23, 2:47 am - James: Maddison showed who the real boy is
25/9/23, 2:47 am - Jono: Newcastle doing what we did last season… an early season flogging to put a facade on their inability to compete for top 4
25/9/23, 2:47 am - James: Foden streets ahead of him too
25/9/23, 2:48 am - James: Newcastle top 5 easy
25/9/23, 2:48 am - James: No you were just pants last season
25/9/23, 2:48 am - Dave: Liverpool vs cherries all over again
25/9/23, 2:48 am - Dave: Back to business as usual next weekend
25/9/23, 2:49 am - James: Expect Varpool to drop off shortly
25/9/23, 2:49 am - Dave: Behave
25/9/23, 2:49 am - Dave: Not seeing any sign of it yet 😬
25/9/23, 2:49 am - Jono: Based on this theory then you’re also pants this season
25/9/23, 2:49 am - Jono: “Top 5 easy” 

We finished 5th
25/9/23, 2:49 am - James: Based on having more points than we did at the same stage last season?
25/9/23, 2:50 am - James: Having already played citeh and Brighton away
25/9/23, 2:50 am - Jono: And us at home ☺️
25/9/23, 2:50 am - James: Yeah shame it didn't get you CL lol
25/9/23, 2:50 am - James: Top five does now
25/9/23, 2:50 am - Jono: Never forget
25/9/23, 2:50 am - Jono: Is 5th ucl? Fuck lol
25/9/23, 2:51 am - James: All I saw was you get battered and get away with one last ten minutes. Alisson the hero again. Let's see what happens as the season goes on
25/9/23, 2:51 am - James: Not looking good in that defence and midfield depth wise
25/9/23, 2:51 am - Jono: Geez lol
25/9/23, 2:52 am - James: Got a lot of Thursday / Sunday games to play
25/9/23, 2:52 am - James: Europa is a cruel mistress
25/9/23, 2:52 am - Jono: We’ll play 11 Ben Doaks in a few weeks
25/9/23, 2:52 am - James: But your manager says it's on par with CL so
25/9/23, 2:52 am - Dave: <Media omitted>
25/9/23, 2:53 am - Jono: It’s like watching a really lame comedian
25/9/23, 2:54 am - James: I'm not joking unfortunately
25/9/23, 2:55 am - James: Was that Saka getting burned by madders for the equaliser?
25/9/23, 2:55 am - Jono: Yes
25/9/23, 2:56 am - Jono: Hence this quote
25/9/23, 2:56 am - Jono: Doubt it’s legit tho
25/9/23, 2:56 am - James: That was never a pen
25/9/23, 2:57 am - James: He couldn't do anything
25/9/23, 2:57 am - Dave: Oh fuck off
25/9/23, 2:57 am - Dave: You have to be joking lol
25/9/23, 2:57 am - Dave: Most clear cut pen in the world
25/9/23, 2:57 am - Jono: Haha mic drop
25/9/23, 2:57 am - Jono: Have a nap Jimmy
25/9/23, 2:58 am - James: So rattled in here
25/9/23, 2:58 am - James: I'll ease off
25/9/23, 2:58 am - Jono: Easy pen
25/9/23, 2:58 am - James: Don't wanna be banned again
25/9/23, 5:09 am - Dave: <Media omitted>
25/9/23, 5:33 am - Liam: Eddie
25/9/23, 5:34 am - Liam: Can only be Eddie
25/9/23, 5:35 am - James: You gave him number 14 😭
25/9/23, 5:37 am - Liam: #artetaOUT!
25/9/23, 5:38 am - James: Humbled
25/9/23, 5:51 am - Dave: Our number 1 striker

25/9/23, 6:19 am - James: <Media omitted>
25/9/23, 6:21 am - Dave: Spurs nearly lost to Sheffield and city nearly drew with Sheffield. You know what this means James. 

Newcastle are winning the league
25/9/23, 6:24 am - James: Didn't sheffield lose both those games in added time?
25/9/23, 6:25 am - Jono: They’re not losing another game
25/9/23, 6:28 am - Dave: Yep. Just proves how unbelievably strong strong and dominant Newcastle are. Best team in the league
25/9/23, 6:28 am - Dave: 💯
25/9/23, 6:29 am - Jono: Until they lose
25/9/23, 6:30 am - James: None of those teams have Anthony Gordon 💫
25/9/23, 6:31 am - James: Would you take Wilson or Isak @14244893404
25/9/23, 6:32 am - Dave: For a season? Wilson
25/9/23, 6:32 am - James: 42 in 80 for Newcastle now for Wilson. 15 in his last 18
25/9/23, 6:32 am - Dave: Long term investment I’d take isak
25/9/23, 6:32 am - Dave: But I think Wilson is a better player when he’s fit and would have way more of an impact at Arsenal
25/9/23, 6:33 am - James: Wilson is a goal machine
25/9/23, 6:33 am - James: Better in the box
25/9/23, 6:38 am - Dave: Isak more versatile but less proven. Way younger though, lots of time to improve
25/9/23, 6:39 am - James: Would you take Nunez?
25/9/23, 6:39 am - Dave: Over Eddie? In a heartbeat lol
25/9/23, 6:40 am - James: He just needs a run in a team somewhere
25/9/23, 6:40 am - Dave: I’d be disappointed if arsenal had paid 100m for him
25/9/23, 6:40 am - Dave: Eddie?
25/9/23, 6:41 am - James: Yeah
25/9/23, 6:42 am - James: Some players can't just fill in and then back to bench
25/9/23, 6:42 am - Dave: Don’t agree, think he’s hit his ability ceiling
25/9/23, 6:43 am - James: Balogan would have been decent
25/9/23, 6:43 am - Dave: Hard worker, just not got good footballing IQ and not good enough
25/9/23, 6:43 am - Dave: Agree, shite attitude though
25/9/23, 6:43 am - James: Watkins would be good
25/9/23, 6:43 am - James: Or Toney
25/9/23, 6:43 am - James: Toney shite attitude too
25/9/23, 6:43 am - Dave: I’d love either of them
25/9/23, 6:43 am - Liam: Balogan missed 2 pens in the same game at the weekend
25/9/23, 6:44 am - Dave: Heard that lol
25/9/23, 6:44 am - Liam: Other team scored in injury time to win the game
25/9/23, 6:44 am - Dave: But he’s definitely a better player than Eddie
25/9/23, 6:44 am - Liam: 40m thank you very much
25/9/23, 6:44 am - Dave: Technically
25/9/23, 6:44 am - James: Didn't realise it was that football manager bloke who had Balogan last season
25/9/23, 6:46 am - Dave: Arsenal were linked with Ferguson during window, give us him 😂
25/9/23, 6:47 am - James: Didn't Varpool have him on the books but he wanted to leave
25/9/23, 6:50 am - Dave: Didn’t know that
25/9/23, 6:50 am - Dave: He’s class
25/9/23, 2:18 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 I skimmed all that, is Jimmy giving it the biggun because his team smash a championship side that was estimated to go straight back down?
25/9/23, 11:53 pm - Gerrard: It wasn't a great game to watch
26/9/23, 12:35 am - Dave: https://x.com/utdtrey/status/1706333732032876883?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA

This is bonkers 

Trolling your own player… and then getting sued by him
26/9/23, 11:56 pm - James: What's wrong with it
26/9/23, 11:57 pm - Jono: You’d expect it from opponents accounts
26/9/23, 11:57 pm - Jono: But not your own club 😅
26/9/23, 11:59 pm - James: Yeah true. Tik Tok generation though. Social media ran by someone with the mental age of 12.
26/9/23, 11:59 pm - James: Don't think it's trolling. Just a bit cringe
26/9/23, 11:59 pm - James: He can deffo use that as a way out the club though now 😂
27/9/23, 12:22 am - Dave: This isn’t the first time apparently 😬😬😬😬😬 https://x.com/_collins_a/status/1706784242485613030?s=46&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
27/9/23, 12:23 am - Jono: Wonder if they’d post these if he was white?
27/9/23, 12:24 am - Dave: This is blatantly racist. Italians are notoriously racist towards black players
27/9/23, 12:34 am - Jono: This is nuts

27/9/23, 2:26 am - Dave: This is wild. Chelsea are fucked ❤️
27/9/23, 2:31 am - James: Read somewhere they've had the easiest fixture list to start the season
27/9/23, 2:31 am - James: Only scored 5 and 5 points?
27/9/23, 2:31 am - James: They've got a horrendous run of games soon up to Christmas
27/9/23, 2:31 am - James: Could be bottom 3
27/9/23, 2:32 am - James: Have you looked at their squad. One billion and it's shite
27/9/23, 4:31 am - Dave: Imagine if they get relegated
27/9/23, 4:31 am - Dave: I wonder what the odds are
27/9/23, 4:36 am - Dave: Just put a fiver on Chelsea to get relegated 😂 paying 151/1
27/9/23, 11:50 am - Jono: https://x.com/yugdeep_lfc/status/1706702284879442307?s=48

28/9/23, 3:33 am - Dave: Bet that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside ❤️
28/9/23, 3:34 am - Gerrard: Yeah
28/9/23, 3:42 am - Jono: Silver linings eh
28/9/23, 3:44 am - Gerrard: Nice to know we're all out there with our alcohol abuse keeping a roof over bartender kid's heads
28/9/23, 3:44 am - Jono: 19 games undefeated
28/9/23, 3:44 am - Jono: Speaking of silver linings
28/9/23, 3:51 am - Gerrard: Please stop jinxing

28/9/23, 3:51 am - Gerrard: Please

28/9/23, 3:52 am - Jono: Given my recent airings of confidence
28/9/23, 4:46 am - James: On insurance claims?
28/9/23, 4:47 am - Gerrard: I don't think you can claim money back from the bar after watching Milan v Newie
28/9/23, 4:49 am - James: UCL bud
28/9/23, 4:49 am - James: Top tier
28/9/23, 4:49 am - Gerrard: You got the worst comebacks this season
28/9/23, 4:50 am - James: Not a come back. Just facts bruv
28/9/23, 4:51 am - Gerrard: So if Newy comes dead last in their CL group and Livo win the Europa, you'll just say UCL bud?
28/9/23, 4:51 am - James: You won't win Europa. Please stop with the hypotheticals
28/9/23, 4:53 am - James: UCL mate

30/9/23, 6:57 pm - James: Red card 🟥
30/9/23, 6:57 pm - James: Well done VAR 👏
30/9/23, 6:57 pm - Dave: Not watching, what’s happened
30/9/23, 6:57 pm - James: Disgusting Varpool player studded a spurs player
30/9/23, 6:57 pm - Jono: Remember last time we got a red @61452662705 😊
30/9/23, 6:58 pm - Dave: I’ve got a great acca coming in if spurs win
30/9/23, 6:58 pm - James: Rattled already. Bringing up the past. Typical Australian Liverpool supporter

30/9/23, 7:00 pm - Jono: <Media omitted>
30/9/23, 7:00 pm - James: I just remember them getting battered prior and after the red card. They'll just have to hope Alisson gets them out of it again
30/9/23, 7:01 pm - James: @14244893404 heads gone. Bringing up Newcastle while the game with spurs is still going on 😂
30/9/23, 7:01 pm - Gerrard: Ref love giving us Reds this year
30/9/23, 7:01 pm - Gerrard: *Refs
30/9/23, 7:02 pm - Gerrard: I think this will be much much much harder than playing with 10 men against Newy, tough day
30/9/23, 7:03 pm - James: @14244893404 any news on azlob having asthma?
30/9/23, 7:03 pm - James: Klopp getting those inhalers ready for HT
30/9/23, 7:07 pm - James: Maddison > Slob
30/9/23, 7:11 pm - Gerrard: Tough day
30/9/23, 7:12 pm - Gerrard: Fuck Ange

30/9/23, 7:23 pm - Jono: Omg
30/9/23, 7:24 pm - Jono: Fucking Diaz
30/9/23, 7:24 pm - Jono: Should’ve buried that
30/9/23, 7:33 pm - Pero: Whats the liv-spurs game like ? I drove to the village after the arsenal game so no prem league coverage for a couple days
30/9/23, 7:35 pm - Jono: Another VAR call ruining the game. A red that not many agree with including Defoe and Neville to date. 

Other than that the game pretty even LFC had the better chances but Spurs look dangerous on the counter
30/9/23, 7:36 pm - Pero: Maddison being a cock head again no doubt
30/9/23, 7:37 pm - Jono: He keeps yapping to ref whenever there’s any tackle or normal contact happens. Szob wants to knock him out
30/9/23, 7:37 pm - Jono: Trying to egg the ref on and it worked with the Jones red
30/9/23, 7:38 pm - Pero: It'll be great if anyone knocks him out

30/9/23, 8:04 pm - Jono: Yep
30/9/23, 8:04 pm - Jono: Scandalous
30/9/23, 8:06 pm - Dave: 9 defenders on the pitch then
30/9/23, 8:06 pm - Dave: Not deserved?
30/9/23, 8:06 pm - Jono: The first yellow was garbage
30/9/23, 8:17 pm - Dave: Spurs need to win this
30/9/23, 8:17 pm - Dave: Embarrassing if they can’t pick up 3 points here
30/9/23, 8:29 pm - Dave: Lol, unlucky lads. You deserved a point out of that
30/9/23, 8:33 pm - Jono: Brutal
30/9/23, 8:33 pm - Dave: Unbeaten run done

30/9/23, 8:36 pm - Dave: Just watching highlights, you got shafted with that jota goal. That was on.
30/9/23, 8:36 pm - Jono: This sums it up
30/9/23, 8:36 pm - Jono: Yeah this is summary of the offside that wasn’t
30/9/23, 8:39 pm - Dave: Yeah you were robbed today. To be fair, this is an anomaly, liverpool usually love a good VAR decision in their favour
30/9/23, 10:27 pm - James: Tick tock. Varpool luck runs out. Brighton away next week 🫨
30/9/23, 10:27 pm - James: 🟥🟥
30/9/23, 10:27 pm - James: 🔥
30/9/23, 11:38 pm - Gerrard: Told you Varpool is dead

1/10/23, 12:06 am - Dave: Fucking pathetic
1/10/23, 12:06 am - Gerrard: Watch him celebrate the OG
1/10/23, 12:06 am - Dave: Beat 9 men liverpool, at home, by an own goal, with all those decisions in their favour
1/10/23, 12:06 am - Dave: Literally had 40 mins of 9 men and couldn’t break them down
1/10/23, 12:07 am - Dave: Who?
1/10/23, 12:07 am - Gerrard: If he doesn't acknowledge it, you'll see the giant cunt I've always known him to be
1/10/23, 12:07 am - Gerrard: Ange
1/10/23, 12:07 am - Dave: I didn’t see him celebrate, where is it
1/10/23, 12:07 am - Gerrard: ONLINE!
1/10/23, 12:08 am - Dave: To be fair I’d be celebrating the goal if I was him. But I wouldn’t be doing laps of honour at the end of the game to Robbie
1/10/23, 12:08 am - Dave: If that had ended a draw, it’s as good as a loss for them
1/10/23, 12:08 am - Gerrard: The only reason I'm annoyed is because City lost too
1/10/23, 12:09 am - Dave: Yeah that was your chance to go top
1/10/23, 12:10 am - Dave: You’ll bounce back against Brighton I’m sure. Shocked they lost 6-1 today to villa
1/10/23, 12:11 am - Gerrard: Great chances with 10 men too
1/10/23, 12:11 am - Gerrard: Fuck Tottenham
1/10/23, 12:11 am - Gerrard: Fuck the refs
1/10/23, 12:11 am - Gerrard: Every week we're talking about the refs
1/10/23, 12:12 am - Jono: We’re nailed on top 4 after that game. Team look motivated
1/10/23, 12:12 am - Jono: I’m actually satisfied despite the loss
1/10/23, 12:12 am - Jono: A relief after that monstrosity of last season
1/10/23, 1:41 am - James: Just cycles init. Varpool been getting dodgy decisions for years. Arsenal had shit ones against last season. So did we. Suck it up and take the L 🔥
1/10/23, 1:43 am - James: Think they'll lose there too tbh
1/10/23, 1:46 am - James: It almost reminds me of when we were robbed at anfield when Mike 'Liverpool fan' Dean and his team dissalowed isak's second goal
1/10/23, 1:47 am - James: Weird how it's all gone pete tong for Varpool since he has retired

1/10/23, 5:35 am - Gerrard: Love how the Arsenal fans are all over undefeated stats each season, last bit of joy
1/10/23, 5:43 am - Dave: 🧂
1/10/23, 5:44 am - Gerrard: That one hit on point eh
1/10/23, 5:44 am - Dave: I typed out a reply about you being desperate to beat the invincibles season a couple of years back before getting toppled by watford and losing the league
1/10/23, 5:45 am - Dave: Then I deleted it and went for the salt instead
1/10/23, 5:46 am - Dave: Can’t we just all United against the common enemy… 👀
1/10/23, 6:01 am - Gerrard: Lol
1/10/23, 6:02 am - Gerrard: I'm just saying it's cute, no sledge
1/10/23, 8:27 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 OH! You meant this common enemy!
1/10/23, 8:33 am - Gerrard: Jamesy gets more joy from Liverpool finally losing than Newie winning a couple games in a row 🥰
1/10/23, 8:39 am - James: Stop it 😂
1/10/23, 10:51 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 he's reading through all the messages to see if anyone mentioned Newy

3/10/23, 2:21 am - Dave: Not sure. Just spuds fans saying their play was stronger after receiving racial abuse from liverpool fans?
3/10/23, 2:22 am - Gerrard: Kick em out
3/10/23, 2:22 am - Gerrard: Ban the cists

3/10/23, 3:13 am - Gerrard: Says the guy who claimed the whole PL were trying to stop the Saudi takeover
3/10/23, 3:14 am - James: Was all fact
3/10/23, 3:14 am - Gerrard: So is this then
3/10/23, 3:14 am - Gerrard: As if Sky isn't in bed with them
3/10/23, 3:15 am - James: Who's fault will it be when you get humped by Brighton this weekend I wonder
3/10/23, 3:15 am - James: Always the victims
3/10/23, 3:15 am - Gerrard: Refs are the worst thing about Football, always said this
3/10/23, 3:15 am - Gerrard: We aren't the only ones getting fucked by Refs
3/10/23, 3:16 am - Gerrard: Destroying football
3/10/23, 4:19 am - Jono: Not one of the guys in that video is affiliated to Liverpool
3/10/23, 4:19 am - Jono: It's a common view
3/10/23, 7:35 am - Dave: Would you take him over Klopp?
3/10/23, 8:06 am - Gerrard: Don't be silly
3/10/23, 8:06 am - Gerrard: Klopp is the best manager in the league
3/10/23, 8:19 am - Dave: There you go
3/10/23, 8:25 am - Gerrard: Emery is 3rd best in the league though
3/10/23, 8:25 am - Gerrard: Arteta 5th
3/10/23, 8:25 am - Gerrard: So, improvement
3/10/23, 8:31 am - Jono: People paid to make decisions can’t make decision
3/10/23, 8:31 am - Jono: Shock horror
3/10/23, 9:06 am - Gerrard: Like they said earlier in the season refs covering for their ref mates
3/10/23, 9:15 am - Chris: Why can't the premier league demand they release it. Wouldn't that take it out of the ref's hands?
3/10/23, 9:16 am - Jono: Coz their reputation is at stake
3/10/23, 9:16 am - Chris: Prem or ref's?
3/10/23, 9:16 am - Jono: Both
3/10/23, 9:16 am - Chris: Aren't the ref's employees of prem? Just like clubs are employees of prem
3/10/23, 9:16 am - Jono: They know things blow over
3/10/23, 9:18 am - Jono: If they know already the detail and it’s enough to negatively tarnish their rep more than just ‘investigating’ and letting time blow over the whole thing then they’ll probably go for the latter
3/10/23, 9:18 am - Jono: Like they did for the city charges
3/10/23, 9:18 am - Jono: Which everyone has conveniently forgotten
3/10/23, 9:18 am - Jono: Especially Sky Sports who pay a lot for the rights
3/10/23, 9:19 am - Jono: And would hope the league stays reputable
3/10/23, 9:22 am - James: Basically 'correct decision'.

Hold on, didn't they award the goal.

No, it's been disallowed for offside.

Shit game has resumed. We can't stop the game as per protocol
3/10/23, 9:23 am - James: Somehow they've thought it was allowed when it wasn't. Once the game restarts after a check complete. You can't do anything
3/10/23, 9:23 am - James: But they should have in this instance 🤷
3/10/23, 9:24 am - James: Not technically. I think the FA
3/10/23, 9:25 am - Jono: I don’t think it’s anything to do with the incident itself… well, if it as described above than it shouldn’t be an issue to release the audio
3/10/23, 9:26 am - Jono: My thing is the whole lending officials to the UAE two days earlier that I think the PGMOL are finding hard to explain
3/10/23, 9:26 am - Jono: They’ve probably allowed it to happen without consulting the PL
3/10/23, 9:26 am - James: Other scenario is the ref may have jumped the gun and restarted the game when they were still checking
3/10/23, 9:26 am - Jono: And that’s where all the internal debate lies around what to release vs what not to release
3/10/23, 9:26 am - James: Once he does that var can't do anything
3/10/23, 9:27 am - James: Yeah they make refs make their own way across the country as well
3/10/23, 9:27 am - James: Matches finish for them at 10pm for 3pm kick offs after they do all the reports.
3/10/23, 9:27 am - Jono: Both parties trying to line up their stories to keep their reps in tact
3/10/23, 9:28 am - James: Basically. Someone is getting fired
3/10/23, 9:28 am - James: And I'd hedge a bet the ref was the one who fucked up. If it's released and that's what happened he's done for
3/10/23, 9:30 am - Gerrard: Ref looked like someone in over his head
3/10/23, 9:32 am - James: Ref's are terrible. Getting worse every season
3/10/23, 9:33 am - Dave: Good
3/10/23, 9:33 am - Dave: Need to start making an example of out of them and they’ll improve
3/10/23, 9:34 am - Gerrard: Two quick yellows for non violent conduct is a sign of a ref panicking for his job, could've easily had a hard chat with him before a send.
3/10/23, 9:34 am - Dave: It’s embarrassing. Not rocket science and there’s no need for debate or interpretation now we have VAR. Just get it right
3/10/23, 9:34 am - Gerrard: Hired good refs even if foreign
3/10/23, 9:34 am - Gerrard: Hire
3/10/23, 9:35 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 are you high or drunk? 
You're sounding half reasonable this arvo.
3/10/23, 9:35 am - James: Had a few beers this arvo
3/10/23, 9:35 am - James: $17 EACH
3/10/23, 9:35 am - Dave: Bargain
3/10/23, 9:45 am - Gerrard: Lol
3/10/23, 11:46 am - Jono: https://x.com/westham_central/status/1708943794211611066?s=48

Here’s the audio gents
3/10/23, 12:35 pm - Pero: Very controversial that audio
3/10/23, 12:37 pm - Gerrard: Scandalous
3/10/23, 12:46 pm - Shaun: sounds likes Gerards room
3/10/23, 1:41 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/yleg7Xqt4nM?si=7IXx8b9J61qyRxjl
I was telling Pero on the trip, I saw the Rugby video ref techniques and it's infinitely better than what we got.
Discussion between all refs, images on stadium screens, and we hear the convo on the coverage.
3/10/23, 1:53 pm - Shaun: Same with NRL and cricket
3/10/23, 2:10 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/30xnxCyurF4?si=kGnpv2Zg9EftBr_M
3/10/23, 9:36 pm - Jono: No surprise, the audio is worse than I thought
3/10/23, 9:36 pm - Jono: https://twitter.com/FabrizioRomano/status/1709261938348171301
3/10/23, 10:30 pm - Pero: We need Ramas back in the starting line up
3/10/23, 10:31 pm - Dave: I didn’t see the first goal, heard it came from a Raya clanger 😬
3/10/23, 10:32 pm - Dave: Good second goal from lens. We don’t look very switched on tonight
3/10/23, 10:35 pm - Pero: Yep raya clanger, his passing is off,  and from the restart he went to trap it and went under his foot. Arsenal not playing direct enough. Smithy and Nelson on now, let's see what they can do
3/10/23, 10:36 pm - Dave: Time for arteta to sub the goalie like he said he’d do
3/10/23, 10:36 pm - Dave: 😂
3/10/23, 10:36 pm - Dave: Arsenal love a late comeback, let’s see 🤞
3/10/23, 10:40 pm - Pero: Haha he did say it, clean sheet you stay otherwise you gone
3/10/23, 10:40 pm - Jono: Saka injured?
3/10/23, 10:40 pm - Pero: Cmon gunners !! Let's get one!
3/10/23, 10:40 pm - Pero: Yep saka came off injured
3/10/23, 10:41 pm - Jono: Onana fucked up again
3/10/23, 10:41 pm - Dave: Their fans chants are so dreary
3/10/23, 10:41 pm - Jono: And got casemiro sent off
3/10/23, 10:41 pm - Dave: Was only a matter of time starting 90 games in a row
3/10/23, 10:42 pm - Dave: Starting to feel sorry for him now
3/10/23, 10:42 pm - Jono: Lucky for him icardi can’t hit pens
3/10/23, 10:43 pm - Dave: Arsenal screwing up my acca here. Had Galatasaray, Arsenal and Madrid to win
3/10/23, 10:44 pm - Dave: Great odds. Was shocked Galatasaray were paying 7-1 against United 😂😂
3/10/23, 10:46 pm - Jono: Here comes Antony
3/10/23, 10:46 pm - James: Arsenal losing to who?
3/10/23, 10:46 pm - Jono: Bottom of the barrel stuff
3/10/23, 10:46 pm - James: Manure losing to the Turks 😂
3/10/23, 10:46 pm - Jono: That Armabat is absolute garbage
3/10/23, 10:46 pm - Jono: Who said he was good? Haha
3/10/23, 10:46 pm - Dave: The mighty lens
3/10/23, 10:47 pm - Dave: Not even an unfair result. Lens deserve it from what I’ve seen. Only caught the second half
3/10/23, 10:47 pm - James: Maybe you'll feel better tomorrow when we get hammered 5-0 by psg
3/10/23, 10:47 pm - James: Onana is wank
3/10/23, 10:48 pm - Dave: If we come away with a point that would be a fair result. Wouldn’t say arsenal are particularly dominant tonight whatsoever
3/10/23, 10:49 pm - James: Doesn't look good for English football
3/10/23, 10:49 pm - James: Lens and Galatasaray
3/10/23, 10:50 pm - James: Didn't think manure would get out that group
3/10/23, 10:50 pm - Dave: I didn’t have United to win that, they’re so shit at the moment
3/10/23, 10:51 pm - James: Manure won't beat bayern and won't win in Turkey
3/10/23, 10:51 pm - James: Out already
3/10/23, 10:53 pm - Pero: Double corner for gunners last kick ffs
3/10/23, 10:57 pm - James: Story of the season so far?
3/10/23, 10:59 pm - James: Best thing since sliced bread middle of last season
3/10/23, 10:59 pm - Dave: Dominant last weekend
3/10/23, 10:59 pm - James: Remember when manure fans were saying rashford was the best striker in Europe
3/10/23, 10:59 pm - Dave: “Eras come to an end”
3/10/23, 10:59 pm - James: Bournemouth
3/10/23, 11:00 pm - Dave: “Rashford is a different level to Saka,” 

“Rashford is the new Ronaldo for us” 

“Rashford is world class”
3/10/23, 11:00 pm - James: I absolutely love seeing man utd suffer
3/10/23, 11:00 pm - Dave: Heard it all
3/10/23, 11:01 pm - Dave: Every team in the prem is decent, no such thing as an easy win. We’re just inconsistent this season. Not bowling teams over like we were this time last season
3/10/23, 11:07 pm - Louie: We still have a mathematical chance
3/10/23, 11:11 pm - Jono: You’ll still qualify, just
3/10/23, 11:11 pm - Jono: They always find a way
3/10/23, 11:20 pm - Jono: So much Onana hate on twitter
3/10/23, 11:20 pm - Jono: Though his backline should take a fair amount of heat.. they were diabolical
3/10/23, 11:32 pm - James: So that's worse than losing to Luton?
3/10/23, 11:36 pm - Jono: https://x.com/fabrizioromano/status/1709320936170684893?s=48
3/10/23, 11:39 pm - Jono: He’s the glue
3/10/23, 11:39 pm - Jono: Could be disaster for the Gooners
3/10/23, 11:44 pm - James: Losing to the French Luton and losing starboy for the season
3/10/23, 11:46 pm - Jono: Good timing with City this weekend 🙀
3/10/23, 11:53 pm - James: They've got Havertz
3/10/23, 11:54 pm - Liam: Settle down
4/10/23, 12:22 am - Dave: Unbeaten in the league, second in the league and second in our champions league group. Some strange shit talking going on in here
4/10/23, 1:56 am - Dave: What’s this shite 😂😂😂
4/10/23, 2:03 am - Dave: Mbappe vs trippier and dembele vs Dan burn
4/10/23, 2:04 am - James: What's Newcastle got to do with any of this 😂
4/10/23, 2:06 am - Jono: Galatasaray had NEVER won in England
4/10/23, 2:06 am - Jono: And hadn't won in Europe in 5 years
4/10/23, 2:07 am - James: Had Lens ever played in Europe prior to this season?
4/10/23, 2:09 am - Jono: Last time was in 2002
4/10/23, 2:09 am - Jono: UCL
4/10/23, 2:10 am - Jono: Last time in Europa (UEFA Cup) was 2007
4/10/23, 2:11 am - Dave: When has piping up to put the boot in just before Newcastle play done you any favours?
4/10/23, 2:13 am - Dave: Henry said it is a very difficult place to play 🤷🏼‍♂️
4/10/23, 2:13 am - James: We're just chatting aren't we
4/10/23, 2:13 am - James: Jesus. Just take the L like a big boy and move on
4/10/23, 2:14 am - James: Yeah neutral view from Terry Henry
4/10/23, 2:17 am - James: What happened today then @14244893404?
4/10/23, 2:18 am - Jono: Their glue got injured
4/10/23, 2:19 am - Jono: Like us losing Mo
4/10/23, 2:19 am - Jono: Or Newy losing Miggy 😅
4/10/23, 2:19 am - James: Arsenal fans go on about all the young talent they have. All the depth?
4/10/23, 2:20 am - Jono: Big test now for Mikel 

A few injuries to ponder over
4/10/23, 2:25 am - James: Got the 'arteta out' brigade to address if they lose to Citeh at the weekend
4/10/23, 3:01 am - Dave: Behave
4/10/23, 3:02 am - Dave: Unfortunately yes. I’m really not sure why Arteta didn’t focus on signing backup for Saka and bringing in a solid and dependable striker
4/10/23, 3:16 am - Gerrard: What's wrong with these grey haired English football fans acting like they're 20 and hard?
4/10/23, 3:16 am - James: Arsenal fans
4/10/23, 3:17 am - Gerrard: I've seen Chelsea ones too
4/10/23, 3:17 am - James: Grandpa is going to do him at the final whistle
4/10/23, 3:17 am - Dave: He’d definitely do you 💦
4/10/23, 3:17 am - James: Arsenal and Chelsea same thing really
4/10/23, 3:18 am - Gerrard: I guess so
4/10/23, 3:18 am - Gerrard: So I haven't read all the messages, what happened this morning?
4/10/23, 3:27 am - Gerrard: Wow, I just saw the CL hoghlights
4/10/23, 3:27 am - Gerrard: *highlights
4/10/23, 3:48 am - Jono: Bellinghams goal was so damn good
4/10/23, 3:48 am - Dave: Bellingham is unreal for 20. Way beyond his years on and off the pitch
4/10/23, 3:49 am - Jono: Scary good
4/10/23, 3:49 am - James: Signing for Liverpool apparently his dad is a fan
4/10/23, 3:50 am - Gerrard: Fuck him
4/10/23, 3:50 am - Jono: Pipe down we got a decent alternative anyway in Szob
4/10/23, 3:50 am - Gerrard: Celebrates assists like he's a god, gtfo
4/10/23, 3:51 am - Gerrard: Dortmund team hated him
4/10/23, 3:51 am - Jono: I can appreciate Jude now knowing we’ve got a Szob anyway
4/10/23, 3:51 am - Gerrard: What was this?
4/10/23, 3:51 am - Gerrard: Bet you appreciate Bruno Fernandes too
4/10/23, 3:51 am - Jono: Fuck that cuntface
4/10/23, 3:51 am - Jono: He’s shit anyway
4/10/23, 4:40 am - James: Arsenal game?
4/10/23, 4:40 am - James: Onana strikes me as someone who is being paid to throw matches he's that bad
4/10/23, 4:53 am - Jono: Was cool seeing Lens stadium again after only remembering it previously from Argies beating England in 98
4/10/23, 4:53 am - Jono: Hasn't changed at all
4/10/23, 4:54 am - Jono: Along with England falling apart at major tournaments
4/10/23, 5:59 am - Jono: https://youtu.be/lJQnr6N5PKw?si=sgP2CREbtXyK6dY0
4/10/23, 5:59 am - Liam: Worth a watch, it was a great game! Well done lens.
4/10/23, 6:01 am - Dave: Same. I’m so bemused every time I watch him. He just sort of freezes and throws his arms in the air not even in the direction of the ball 😂😂
4/10/23, 6:04 am - James: Reminds me of Bruce Grobellar (however you spell it)
4/10/23, 6:05 am - James: Varpool 'keeper throwing matches
4/10/23, 6:06 am - James: Nice at least one Arsenal fan enjoyed it then ☺️
4/10/23, 6:09 am - Dave: Made me lol. Bellinghams childhood best mates Aunty saw Anfield once, signing for liverpool innit
4/10/23, 6:13 am - James: They got Szlob though he's the same as Bellingham
4/10/23, 6:13 am - Jono: He is
4/10/23, 6:14 am - Dave: Europa, champions league, same thing innit
4/10/23, 6:14 am - James: Europa League - Champions league = Same
4/10/23, 6:14 am - Jono: Szob will be PFA player of the year. Calling it.
4/10/23, 6:14 am - Jono: Bookmark or pin it - whatever you wanna do
4/10/23, 6:15 am - James: Usually reserved for a player from a team that won something like the league
4/10/23, 6:16 am - Jono: Suarez did it after carrying arguably the worst looking LFC team I had ever seen up until that point
4/10/23, 6:17 am - James: Didn't know that. I only remember the biting and racism
4/10/23, 6:50 am - Gerrard: I think Varpool is done mate lol
4/10/23, 6:50 am - Gerrard: Carrying? When he was suspended?
4/10/23, 6:55 am - Dave: Get a couple more robbery’s on your belt and you can ditch the name
4/10/23, 7:02 am - Gerrard: I'm counting the Jones and MacAllister reds too
4/10/23, 7:02 am - Gerrard: And the Henderson disallowed goal vs Everton
4/10/23, 7:03 am - Gerrard: And the VVD knee breaker from Pickford
4/10/23, 7:03 am - Gerrard: And the 'we couldnt see it on the camera' offside goal for Arsenal
4/10/23, 7:04 am - Dave: If we’d had your luck last season with VAR, we would have won the league. That’s all I’m saying
4/10/23, 9:29 am - Gerrard: Hey I ain't calling you VARsenal
4/10/23, 9:29 am - Gerrard: Show me the luck?
4/10/23, 9:40 am - Liam: Not luck, if it was just correctly used. 1-1 brentford, 3-1 United
4/10/23, 9:43 am - Gerrard: I mean Livo having the luck
4/10/23, 9:43 am - Gerrard: Misunderstood Rodders
4/10/23, 9:58 am - James: Love how fans of clubs only look at decisions that went against them and not for them 😂
4/10/23, 10:12 am - Gerrard: I don't see remember a lot of wrong good decisions for us last year, finished 5th mate, Europa mate
4/10/23, 10:19 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/FZ-SROg8Jzk?si=LSv7AqSy0P0ckzTm
Where are the old lads?
4/10/23, 10:20 am - Gerrard: These sluts don't react enough
4/10/23, 10:34 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/U6-fsTATYUs?si=rJU_5rw6-JEG8z9V
4/10/23, 10:38 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/Z8uBbMwvmcQ?si=FkHKMbRJW-cuKs8G
Check the 3rd guy
4/10/23, 10:47 am - Liam: Lens played superb. Great goals, sometimes its just not your day.
4/10/23, 10:53 am - James: Arteta out trending?
4/10/23, 10:57 am - James: Did you read any of the comments!?
4/10/23, 10:57 am - Gerrard: Nah, what they say?
4/10/23, 11:10 am - James: Arteta not good enough. Also about his mismanagement of Saka
4/10/23, 11:10 am - Gerrard: I heard Saka got injured
4/10/23, 11:18 am - Jono: Sounds like long term too
4/10/23, 11:22 am - Gerrard: I'm boycotting it due to their human rights offences
4/10/23, 11:34 am - James: It's coming home

4/10/23, 10:04 pm - Gerrard: Show me the incorrect calls?
4/10/23, 10:05 pm - Pero: Newy 31% possession with double the amount of shots and up 2-0. What is going on
4/10/23, 10:07 pm - Dave: Counter attacking kings from the looks of it. Good on them, PSG getting found out by Eddie Howes barmy army
4/10/23, 10:08 pm - James: Press press press
4/10/23, 10:08 pm - Jono: Well deserved lead
4/10/23, 10:09 pm - Gerrard: Sometimes your luck is in
4/10/23, 10:09 pm - James: Stan sport is a bit shit
4/10/23, 10:09 pm - Jono: But that Bruno punch just before HT was brutal haha how did he not get red!
4/10/23, 10:09 pm - Gerrard: Saudis paying
4/10/23, 10:09 pm - Jono: Wasn’t even running motion just went 🥊
4/10/23, 10:10 pm - Jono: Shocked they’re going with Leipzig v City for the studio coverage
4/10/23, 10:11 pm - Gerrard: 🤣
4/10/23, 10:14 pm - James: 3-0
4/10/23, 10:14 pm - James: Local boys
4/10/23, 10:14 pm - Dave: Omg
4/10/23, 10:15 pm - Dave: Newcastle are winning the champions league 😵‍💫😱😱😱
4/10/23, 10:15 pm - Dave: What dreams are made of
4/10/23, 10:18 pm - Pero: Leipzig bringing it to them
4/10/23, 11:55 pm - Gerrard: Crazy results for small teams this round
4/10/23, 11:56 pm - Gerrard: Sportsbet dread
4/10/23, 11:58 pm - James: Newcastle were favourites
4/10/23, 11:58 pm - Jono: I saw that. 2.40
4/10/23, 11:59 pm - Jono: PSG we’re like 3.20 by KO
4/10/23, 11:59 pm - Gerrard: Because of Newy fans?
Geordies going large tonight
4/10/23, 11:59 pm - James: Yesterday it was 2.30 / 2.40
5/10/23, 12:07 am - Gerrard: Does this mean AC Milan are better than PSG?
5/10/23, 12:08 am - James: Probably the manner in which PSG were battered
5/10/23, 12:08 am - Gerrard: They bottle it?
5/10/23, 3:23 am - Gerrard: I keep forgetting that Newty are the richest club in the world
5/10/23, 3:23 am - Gerrard: They should always be favourites
5/10/23, 3:24 am - Gerrard: If they don't win the quadruple then this season is a failure
5/10/23, 3:27 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/Q8tH-bgdS94?si=WIFLUWHAw_DgtYLs
NewVARstle???
2nd goal handball and BrunoG red card?
5/10/23, 3:27 am - Gerrard: Saudi paying Refs?
5/10/23, 3:28 am - James: I'm going to start a petition to get you on that show. You'd fit in perfectly
5/10/23, 3:28 am - Gerrard: Thanks
5/10/23, 3:28 am - James: The 'Aussie twat' sat next to the 'brummy wanker'
5/10/23, 3:28 am - James: Perfection 👌
5/10/23, 3:29 am - Gerrard: So you don't think Newy benefited from some ref decisions in today's game?
5/10/23, 3:33 am - Gerrard: Just saw the double handball in the build up to Dan Burn goal, what's the rule limit of that play?
5/10/23, 3:34 am - Gerrard: They not check it for handball, only offside?
5/10/23, 3:34 am - James: Somebody check on Jezzy
5/10/23, 3:41 am - Gerrard: WOW just saw the BrunoG punch
5/10/23, 3:42 am - Jono: Absolute red hey

Granted Newy deserved to win regardless but yeah that Bruno punch was incredible
5/10/23, 3:42 am - Gerrard: It's a joke that after every new game that gets played, we're all talking about Ref fuck ups
5/10/23, 3:43 am - Gerrard: Well they might have after 1-0 with a handball goal and staying with 11 after violent conduct
5/10/23, 3:43 am - Gerrard: I'm sick of talking about shit Refs
5/10/23, 3:43 am - Gerrard: Football is ruined
5/10/23, 3:44 am - Gerrard: What's our next sport to follow?
5/10/23, 3:44 am - Dave: @61452662705 is this all true? Were PSG robbed? I didn’t watch the full 90
5/10/23, 3:45 am - Gerrard: I just watched the handball, red card and PSG goal. Didn't see any of Newie's actual play but why bother with Refs like that.
5/10/23, 3:45 am - Gerrard: Congrats to Jimmy but that's not how you want to win a game, rather it be honest.
5/10/23, 3:46 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 I'm jack of refs and integrity in football
5/10/23, 3:46 am - Gerrard: Why bother with any of it
5/10/23, 3:48 am - James: Don't think they were robbed 😂 but I don't know. Didn't see either incident I'm at work. Difficult to see everything
5/10/23, 3:48 am - Jono: https://x.com/etleau/status/1709659952418075091?s=48
5/10/23, 3:49 am - Jono: There’s better footage of the punch I need to find
5/10/23, 3:49 am - Jono: Was so clear it was red
5/10/23, 3:53 am - James: You'll have to find something better than that 😂
5/10/23, 3:54 am - James: Looks like he at worst pushed his back 😂
5/10/23, 3:54 am - James: I'm looking on twitter for it but all I'm finding are posts about how sick a baller he is
5/10/23, 3:55 am - James: https://x.com/Matolisso/status/1709676413488357536?s=08
5/10/23, 4:03 am - Gerrard: We need a new answer regarding Refs, @61452662705 was saying to me full AI is the answer.
I still think you need someone on the pitch to break up fights and spray the foam
5/10/23, 4:06 am - Gerrard: How did the ref miss it, THEN the VAR too
5/10/23, 4:06 am - Gerrard: Hammerfist to the back of the head
5/10/23, 4:07 am - Jono: Nuts lol 

It’s laughable
5/10/23, 4:07 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 maybe the VAR luck has transfered to Newy after Nunez's double.
5/10/23, 4:09 am - James: Like how CL football transferred from you to us?
5/10/23, 4:09 am - James: Still looks like his left arm pushed him
5/10/23, 4:09 am - Gerrard: Yeah so you agree
5/10/23, 4:10 am - James: Only contact I can see. Yellow card. Fair dos
5/10/23, 4:10 am - Gerrard: Pushed him by raising his hand above his head the rapidly dropping it onto the back of his head?
5/10/23, 4:11 am - Gerrard: Why you talking about Liverpool now?
They don't play in the CL, Europa on tomorrow.
5/10/23, 4:13 am - James: Hey, if it doesn't go your way perhaps klippity can try get it replayed?
5/10/23, 4:13 am - James: @61409710717 do you think if you get the spurs game replayed, kloppy will moan about fixture congestion like he normally does? 😂 <This message was edited>
5/10/23, 4:14 am - Gerrard: No chance but Klopp just making a point that they're fucked and not letting them get away with the human error sorry defence
5/10/23, 4:15 am - Gerrard: Lashing out because no leg to stand on
5/10/23, 4:15 am - James: Warra fixture that is!
5/10/23, 4:15 am - James: All eyes on Brussels!
5/10/23, 4:15 am - Gerrard: It's funny that you think your angles on sledge are good or effective 🤣
5/10/23, 4:16 am - James: @14244893404 he's too easy a catch 🎣
5/10/23, 4:17 am - Gerrard: After your Livo's not in the CL this year, can we all use that Newy hasn't won a trophy is 80yrs?
5/10/23, 4:18 am - Gerrard: Totally caught 👍🏻
5/10/23, 4:20 am - Jono: 80 years - is that for real? Any trophy?
5/10/23, 4:21 am - Jono: And all this time we shat on the Spurs
5/10/23, 4:21 am - Gerrard: They got the championship title a couple years ago
5/10/23, 4:21 am - Gerrard: Then there's an intertoto cup in the 60s
5/10/23, 4:21 am - Jono: Do loser cups count though?
5/10/23, 4:21 am - Gerrard: Nah
5/10/23, 4:22 am - Jono: That’s incredible for such a ‘big’ club
5/10/23, 4:22 am - James: Hey, Varpools main trophy haul in recent history is loser cups!
5/10/23, 4:22 am - Gerrard: I just want us to clear up who's allowed to have their opinions disregarded and who's allowed to talk to who.
5/10/23, 4:23 am - Gerrard: This is what I mean.
5/10/23, 4:23 am - Gerrard: I'm so confused
5/10/23, 4:23 am - James: Outspent everyone in the 70s and were successful because of it. Like citeh and Chelsea in recent times
5/10/23, 4:23 am - Jono: This is a truly terrible comeback
5/10/23, 4:23 am - Gerrard: Now there's asterisks apparently
5/10/23, 4:23 am - Jono: Sorry mate you were doing okay up until that point
5/10/23, 4:23 am - Gerrard: THATS WHAT I MEAN
5/10/23, 4:23 am - Gerrard: I'm so confused
5/10/23, 4:24 am - James: Then I guess you boys were born and chose to glory hunt. But since you guys have been born, 2 CLs and one pandemic champions league in 40 years?
5/10/23, 4:24 am - Jono: So what’s not recent then? Yesterday ?
5/10/23, 4:24 am - Gerrard: See @61404060785 so confusing
5/10/23, 4:24 am - James: Such a huge club with one prem title in 40 years
5/10/23, 4:24 am - Gerrard: It's like there's an alternative reality and Jimmy jumps between the two when I suits him
5/10/23, 4:24 am - Gerrard: It
5/10/23, 4:25 am - James: What is confusing?
5/10/23, 4:25 am - Gerrard: All of your reasoning and points
5/10/23, 4:25 am - James: You picked the most successful club to support when kids right?
5/10/23, 4:25 am - Gerrard: It does not sense
5/10/23, 4:25 am - James: Neither of you have any connection to Liverpool correct?
5/10/23, 4:25 am - Gerrard: I'd be a United supporter then
5/10/23, 4:26 am - James: No, Manure were successful in mid 90s onwards
5/10/23, 4:26 am - Gerrard: My uncle is Scouse and played for Liverpool youth
5/10/23, 4:26 am - Jono: It’s your prerogative to call it an asterisks league win despite being in an unbeatable lead just prior to covid. It’s poor banter. Poorer than Klopp calling for replays
5/10/23, 4:26 am - Gerrard: Then all the boys here were infected through me
5/10/23, 4:26 am - Gerrard: We watched them suck for all those years
5/10/23, 4:26 am - James: So you guys picked Varpool? And for such a huge club, you have the same premier league count as Blackburn and Leicester City
5/10/23, 4:26 am - Gerrard: We missed the 80s buddy
5/10/23, 4:27 am - James: Same CLs as Chelsea who I assume you both think are a much smaller club? <This message was edited>
5/10/23, 4:27 am - Gerrard: They got 19 titles too?
5/10/23, 4:27 am - Jono: I go for Liverpool because I enjoyed watching John Barnes as a young kid (was a fave of my dads) and I lived near Liverpool in Sydney so just felt natural
5/10/23, 4:27 am - Gerrard: I'm so confused
5/10/23, 4:27 am - Gerrard: Jamesy confuses me so much
5/10/23, 4:27 am - Gerrard: Because you're from Cambridge right?
5/10/23, 4:28 am - Gerrard: I'm so confused
5/10/23, 4:28 am - James: Oh right thanks. We're counting everything prior to when you were born and football was competed by lads working in factories and coalminers
5/10/23, 4:28 am - Jono: Exactly. Me starting to go for LFC around 92 was the start of the drought haha
5/10/23, 4:28 am - Jono: So in fact I jinxed the shit out of us
5/10/23, 4:29 am - Gerrard: I started paying attention to football in 2000
5/10/23, 4:29 am - James: Oh like when Tam was going on  about how you used to make her watch videos of Ian Rush
5/10/23, 4:29 am - Jono: On that basis everyone is utter shite except Man U, City and Arsenal / Chelsea for brief periods
5/10/23, 4:29 am - Jono: How fun
5/10/23, 4:29 am - Gerrard: Minor cup treble year then years of punishment
5/10/23, 4:30 am - Gerrard: Fake news, there weren't videos of Ian Rush back then
5/10/23, 4:30 am - Gerrard: It was just a season review DVD of 2000/01
5/10/23, 4:31 am - Gerrard: "make" is weird too, bitch could've left whenever she liked
5/10/23, 4:33 am - Jono: If we’re just counting our time of supporting LFC - we’ve won the UCL twice. 

Only Madrid, Barca, Mancs, Chelsea and perhaps Juve won the same or more European titles in that time.
5/10/23, 4:33 am - Jono: I’m pretty cool with that
5/10/23, 4:33 am - Jono: 😎
5/10/23, 4:33 am - Gerrard: YouTube started in 2005, just saw
5/10/23, 4:34 am - Gerrard: We ignoring this one?
5/10/23, 4:34 am - James: 3hrs south of Newcastle?
5/10/23, 4:34 am - James: Same country too at least 😂
5/10/23, 4:34 am - Gerrard: How many teams between each city?
5/10/23, 4:34 am - Gerrard: Glory hunter?
5/10/23, 4:35 am - Gerrard: For Shearer getting top goal scorer lol
5/10/23, 4:35 am - James: Is it weird hating England and the English but most of your happiness is determined by an English football team?
5/10/23, 4:35 am - James: What a trip
5/10/23, 4:35 am - Gerrard: Liverpool is like Basque to Spanish
5/10/23, 4:35 am - Gerrard: Be real bro
5/10/23, 4:35 am - James: Why don't you follow an Australian team?
5/10/23, 4:35 am - Gerrard: I do
5/10/23, 4:35 am - Jono: I do
5/10/23, 4:36 am - James: Who?
5/10/23, 4:36 am - Jono: Wanderers
5/10/23, 4:36 am - Gerrard: Sydney FC
5/10/23, 4:36 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 feel like it's a job interview in here today
5/10/23, 4:36 am - Gerrard: Do we qualify?
5/10/23, 4:36 am - Jono: Interrogation
5/10/23, 4:37 am - Gerrard: Date
5/10/23, 4:37 am - James: Call it practice for when you get back on Bumble
5/10/23, 4:37 am - Gerrard: Torture
5/10/23, 4:38 am - Gerrard: You too
5/10/23, 4:38 am - Gerrard: That's an in joke guys, don't worry
5/10/23, 4:38 am - James: Tinder is the better one
5/10/23, 4:38 am - Jono: Isn’t Jimmy on Ashley Maddison?
5/10/23, 4:38 am - James: Nope. Am I missing out?
5/10/23, 4:39 am - Jono: It was good till they got hacked
5/10/23, 4:39 am - Gerrard: Old reference from @61404060785
5/10/23, 4:39 am - Gerrard: Riya
5/10/23, 4:39 am - Gerrard: There's one for rich corp people
5/10/23, 4:39 am - Gerrard: Forgot the name
5/10/23, 4:39 am - Gerrard: Executive types
5/10/23, 4:40 am - Jono: Linkedfuck?
5/10/23, 4:41 am - Gerrard: I'm finally on LinkedIn, need to finish my profile and follow you all
5/10/23, 4:41 am - Jono: Is your North Korean shot your display pic?
5/10/23, 4:41 am - Jono: If not, I won’t accept
5/10/23, 4:42 am - Jono: I got shot down by a colleague yday for following me and noticing I looked a lot better (and kidless) in my pic
5/10/23, 4:42 am - Jono: So basically saying you look shit mate sort yourself out
5/10/23, 4:54 am - Gerrard: What North Korean shot? The Pyongyang train station?
5/10/23, 4:54 am - Gerrard: Happens
5/10/23, 4:55 am - Jono: The photoshopped dictator one
5/10/23, 4:55 am - Gerrard: I finally cut my hair short yesterday, need some new shots
5/10/23, 5:04 am - James: https://x.com/HughWoozencroft/status/1709607032494440792?s=08
5/10/23, 5:10 am - Dave: Jesus, 100 messages to catch up on. I’ll just leave this here
5/10/23, 5:16 am - Gerrard: It needs to get better and you lot are focusing on picking on Klopp instead of pushing long for change, shame.
5/10/23, 5:16 am - Gerrard: *pushing for change
5/10/23, 5:30 am - Dave: Just sad it takes liverpool being on the end of a bad decision for anything to change. We’ve all been fucked repeatedly since VARs inception and we haven’t got 10% of the media coverage you boys have got for one game drawing the short straw
5/10/23, 5:30 am - Dave: Regardless, hope it changes things and standard improves for football
5/10/23, 6:05 am - James: Ohhh good one
5/10/23, 6:06 am - James: When they going to replay that?
5/10/23, 6:15 am - Jono: Probably never but here’s a replay of Nuñez tearing toon arse https://youtu.be/3MfCPhRCNy4?si=pt6JPH904rGT_k5Y
5/10/23, 6:16 am - James: Oh this is such a shit retort
5/10/23, 6:16 am - James: As bad as Jez
5/10/23, 6:16 am - James: Jono jezzed it up in here
5/10/23, 6:16 am - James: Jono done a Jezzo
5/10/23, 6:16 am - Jono: I couldn’t resist with all this replay talk
5/10/23, 6:17 am - Jono: And disappointment Darwin couldn’t be unleashed on the weekend
5/10/23, 6:17 am - James: Old Double D
5/10/23, 6:27 am - Jono: That’s a lot better Jimmy
5/10/23, 6:27 am - Jono: That a realistic short haircut for him as well
5/10/23, 6:28 am - Jono: I would watch Jez rants
5/10/23, 6:29 am - Jono changed this group's icon
5/10/23, 6:44 am - Gerrard: I thought yesterday how's the fate of it happening on the biggest game of the weekend that had no other games on at the same time, to one of the biggest teams in the world, and not a nothing game like Burnley Newy or Forest Brentford.
5/10/23, 6:45 am - Gerrard: He's fishing for your clicks @61452662705
5/10/23, 6:46 am - Gerrard: Wouldn't rant, no energy for it
5/10/23, 6:54 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 being honest, I did accidentally rant at work yesterday about Australia's defence force spending.
5/10/23, 7:47 am - Gerrard: You guys see the World Cup announcement?
5/10/23, 8:05 am - Dave: Yeah, shocking
5/10/23, 8:05 am - Gerrard: What a joke
5/10/23, 8:06 am - Gerrard: Football is dead
5/10/23, 8:06 am - Gerrard: Time for a Baseketball version of football to rise from the ashes
5/10/23, 8:06 am - Gerrard: We could do it
5/10/23, 8:06 am - Gerrard: Football with ice hockey style fighting
5/10/23, 8:17 am - Gerrard: Enforcers and that way no stars get injured.
5/10/23, 8:17 am - Gerrard: Ramos getting his face smashed in was needed a few years ago.
5/10/23, 8:21 am - Jono: What’s the shocking bit?
5/10/23, 8:21 am - Jono: I didn’t think there was anything that FIFA would do that could shock anyone
5/10/23, 8:27 am - Gerrard: Surprise, Mr Uruguay is cool with it
5/10/23, 8:28 am - Jono: Should they not have hosted the centenary World Cup?
5/10/23, 8:28 am - Jono: I knew they were incapable of hosting it being a near 3rd world country
5/10/23, 8:29 am - Jono: But assume FIFA wanted the nostalgic sentiment of allowing the opening game to be where the World Cup was born
5/10/23, 8:30 am - Jono: Which is actually more than I expected knowing they would’ve just been chasing more of prosperous hosting option… Spain/Portugal/Morocco backed by wealthy cunts
5/10/23, 8:31 am - Jono: The most Uruguay were gonna offer was free weed and Spanish bbq
5/10/23, 8:31 am - Gerrard: The three continents is a joke
5/10/23, 8:31 am - Louie: Do they all get automatic qualification?
5/10/23, 8:31 am - Gerrard: No integrity in the game
5/10/23, 8:32 am - Gerrard: UNITED UNITED UNITED
How's it going Lou?!
5/10/23, 8:32 am - Louie: Rasmus is scoring
5/10/23, 8:32 am - Louie: That’s the only thing going for us
5/10/23, 8:33 am - Gerrard: 6 losses in 10
5/10/23, 8:34 am - Gerrard: Time to left them behind, just say you were a Fergie fan and now he's gone you don't support them anymore
5/10/23, 8:34 am - Gerrard: *leave
5/10/23, 8:36 am - Louie: Nah we’ll bounce back
5/10/23, 8:36 am - Louie: All the other teams aren’t worth supporting
5/10/23, 8:42 am - Gerrard: Even Newy?
5/10/23, 8:43 am - Louie: Nah Atilio is a Newy fan and I gave him so much shit when they got relegated and when Bowyer and Dyer had a punch up on the field.
5/10/23, 8:59 am - Gerrard: Fix the lip and come back to me
5/10/23, 9:30 am - Jono: Yep all 6 do

5/10/23, 12:06 pm - Jono: Brilliant 👏
5/10/23, 4:35 pm - Dave: The hypocrisy 😂😂😂
5/10/23, 10:07 pm - Gerrard: I'm so confused that you're still making it an anti Liverpool thing instead of a pro football thing.
5/10/23, 10:47 pm - James: Everyone is because it's been going on for five years and all of a sudden it's happened to varpool, now we need to make a big deal out of it.

Also, no other manager has said 'replay the game' when they've been done by var. But I guess that's because no other club has a complete narcissist as a manager like Liverpool
5/10/23, 10:56 pm - Gerrard: I'm so confused you don't see that you can't compare to anything because this is by far the worst thing VAR has ever done, not Liverpool's fault it happened to them but someone needs to finally take a stand against them for the future of football.
5/10/23, 10:57 pm - Gerrard: I also think you should listen to Klopp's full quote about the 'replay' and not just twitter sound bites so you don't sound like some kind of twitter bitch boi.
5/10/23, 11:06 pm - James: Just take the L and move on. Jeeesus!
5/10/23, 11:06 pm - James: Always the victims #LFC
5/10/23, 11:10 pm - Gerrard: I'm so confused by your agenda against Liverpool and the Liverpool fans in this group.
5/10/23, 11:12 pm - Gerrard: Yeah people shouldn't try to fix injustices, just move on.
You and the Catholic church got the same strategist.
5/10/23, 11:13 pm - James: Victims
6/10/23, 10:29 am - James: https://youtube.com/shorts/VEHFVfu1V2U?feature=shared
6/10/23, 3:45 pm - Gerrard: You still upset about his double?
6/10/23, 4:43 pm - Gerrard: Saw that, nasty dumb fucks
6/10/23, 10:55 pm - James: REPLAY THE GAME!
6/10/23, 10:56 pm - James: Always offended, never ashamed. #LFC
6/10/23, 11:30 pm - James: https://x.com/SkySportsNews/status/1710260990267228610?s=08

7/10/23, 1:04 am - Dave: I actually kind of agree with that to be honest 😂😂 Like I was pumped for Havertz getting his first goal but even he looked a bit embarrassed and ashamed when all the players were celebrating with him lol
7/10/23, 1:06 am - Dave: You woken up and chosen violence against arsenal today? Where’s the anti-toon vids
7/10/23, 1:10 am - Gerrard: Who are Toon?
7/10/23, 1:28 am - Liam: flash in the pan
7/10/23, 1:52 am - Dave: “But city don’t have KDB or Rodri!!!!” 

As we’re losing to Lens and scraping by Everton
7/10/23, 1:53 am - James: Bit personal hey
7/10/23, 1:54 am - Dave: 🤨

7/10/23, 1:56 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 it occured to me yesterday that all of Jimmy's joy in football is because of Mike Ashley
7/10/23, 2:12 am - Gerrard: Maybe the 6th, keep the faith
7/10/23, 2:13 am - Dave: He was edging the club for 20 years before flogging them to the oil money, I’d be like it as well
7/10/23, 2:14 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 not sure if any other owner would've sold to the Saudi gov, or the fact he ran it so low into the ground that the Saudi gov thought they could buy it.
God bless Mike Ashley.
7/10/23, 2:14 am - Gerrard: Sorry, Allah be praised
7/10/23, 2:14 am - Gerrard: Jimmy owes everything to Mike Ashley
7/10/23, 2:15 am - Dave: Would you welcome Allah and the oil money if it meant you got rid of FSG?
7/10/23, 2:15 am - Dave: Half the squad is in Saudi already
7/10/23, 2:16 am - Gerrard: 7th?
7/10/23, 2:20 am - Gerrard: Lol it's getting worse, beg me to hangout in real life so you can get a better photo of me for these
7/10/23, 8:29 am - Gerrard: Now Jimmy thinks this play wasn't handball, he loves a freeze frame - getting desperate
7/10/23, 10:49 am - James: @14244893404 is there an asterisk on everything Varpool have ever won!? Cheating spurs in CL, a worldwide pandemic premier league where they hoarded the worlds supply of inhalers and a CL in 2005 where Dudek essentially ran up to the penalty spot!? <This message was edited>
7/10/23, 11:57 am - Shaun: Poor guy can only afford 50 Ferraris and not 500

7/10/23, 10:55 pm - Louie: McTominyay!!!!!
8/10/23, 12:05 am - Gerrard: I don't know about these injury times, seeing a lot of late late goals this season
8/10/23, 12:12 am - Dave: Is that slob getting all up in there? 
https://www.instagram.com/reel/CyBHORZv30q/?igshid=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==
8/10/23, 12:13 am - Gerrard: Terrible results last night
8/10/23, 12:14 am - Louie: Brentfords fault for time wasting
8/10/23, 12:14 am - Gerrard: Doesn't sound right to me
8/10/23, 12:18 am - Louie: Szobolai surname doesn’t sound right
8/10/23, 2:26 am - James: If it keeps ten hag at manure then it's a good thing
8/10/23, 2:50 am - Louie: It’s in Italy, Giroud probably had 8 defenders in front of him.
8/10/23, 2:07 pm - Gerrard: Should be
8/10/23, 2:08 pm - Gerrard: Fucking dogs don't deserve to say you've won a WC
8/10/23, 4:54 pm - Gerrard: I almost had the right prediction, Livo had the chances to make it 3-1 but let it slip.
8/10/23, 4:56 pm - Dave: Acca dead 😞 

Liverpool off the rails now or did they play well? 1 point from two games
8/10/23, 4:56 pm - Gerrard: Relax there bud
8/10/23, 4:56 pm - Gerrard: They got reffed in the last one
8/10/23, 4:57 pm - Jono: The free kick leading to their 2nd goal was soft but cmon Robbo clear the fucking ball
8/10/23, 4:57 pm - Gerrard: Gave Brighton two goals, hit the crossbar on an open goal than would've been 3-1
8/10/23, 4:57 pm - Gerrard: BUT at least Newy didn't win
8/10/23, 4:58 pm - Dave: So the draw was because of Liverpool mistakes?
8/10/23, 4:59 pm - Gerrard: First goal def mistake
8/10/23, 4:59 pm - Gerrard: From mid though
8/10/23, 4:59 pm - Dave: We’re going to get drummed. Saka and martinelli out. Attack dead
8/10/23, 4:59 pm - Gerrard: Trent had Mintoma in his pocket but for some reason Klopp subbed him
8/10/23, 5:00 pm - Gerrard: Biggest surprise of the night
8/10/23, 5:00 pm - Gerrard: The first part
8/10/23, 5:00 pm - Dave: Trent doesn’t have pockets. Just holes where they should be. You’re lying
8/10/23, 5:00 pm - Gerrard: Honest
8/10/23, 5:01 pm - Gerrard: 🤷🏼‍♂️
8/10/23, 5:01 pm - Jono: Trent was great
8/10/23, 5:01 pm - Jono: No idea why he got subbed
8/10/23, 5:01 pm - Gerrard: Not so much going forward but defensively yeah
8/10/23, 5:01 pm - Dave: Has he learnt how to defend?
8/10/23, 5:01 pm - Gerrard: And forgot how to pass 🤷🏼‍♂️
8/10/23, 5:02 pm - Dave: Typical bloke, can’t do two things at once
8/10/23, 5:02 pm - Jono: Was weird. Trent and Robbo completely ineffective in attack
8/10/23, 5:02 pm - Jono: Most our attack come through the middle
8/10/23, 5:02 pm - Gerrard: It was high press vs high press and ours worked better
8/10/23, 5:03 pm - Gerrard: Mistake on 1st, 2nd was a soft freekick then didn't deal with the ball in
8/10/23, 5:05 pm - Gerrard: Just saw the West Ham 2nd goal 🫡, doing the Lord's work
8/10/23, 5:05 pm - Gerrard: Midfielder wide open and Tonali slack to close him down 🤑
8/10/23, 5:07 pm - Gerrard: Omg, West Ham first goal, Pope at it again 🤭🥹
8/10/23, 5:08 pm - Dave: What happened?
8/10/23, 5:08 pm - Dave: I thought Newcastle best team in Europe?
8/10/23, 5:09 pm - Gerrard: West Ham in Europa or Conference?
8/10/23, 5:14 pm - Gerrard: They've got 1pt against Europa League games
8/10/23, 5:14 pm - Gerrard: *Europa League teams
8/10/23, 5:15 pm - Gerrard: Champions League hangover
8/10/23, 5:16 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 good lucky against the old oil enemy, talk to you in the morning.
8/10/23, 5:16 pm - Dave: Pope is so shit lol. Clanger United
8/10/23, 5:18 pm - Gerrard: Angers me seeing Tottenham top
8/10/23, 5:29 pm - Liam: West ham still above Newcastle?
8/10/23, 5:29 pm - Dave: League doesn’t lie
8/10/23, 6:04 pm - Dave: 100% a red on odegaard
8/10/23, 6:04 pm - Dave: From kovavic. Don’t know how VAR reviewed that and didn’t give it
8/10/23, 6:05 pm - Dave: Could have snapped his ankle or achilles. So late
8/10/23, 6:05 pm - Dave: Didn’t get ball
8/10/23, 6:05 pm - Pero: I'm only doing the watchalong , they are fuming aswell. Was it bad @14244893404 ?
8/10/23, 6:06 pm - Dave: Second foul by kovavic
8/10/23, 6:06 pm - Dave: Wow
8/10/23, 6:07 pm - Dave: Really bad. He just did the same to rice. Not quite as bad but still took
His ankle. Refs on city payroll
8/10/23, 6:07 pm - Pero: Pep sorted it, ref's on the take
8/10/23, 6:12 pm - Dave: Refs scared to give a red after the liverpool outrage all week
8/10/23, 6:14 pm - Liam: I miss Ramsdale
8/10/23, 6:15 pm - Pero: Indeed, refs would be praying for an international break
8/10/23, 6:24 pm - Dave: We’ve been robbed
8/10/23, 6:24 pm - Dave: All pundits saying it’s a red
8/10/23, 6:24 pm - Dave: REPLAY THE GAME
8/10/23, 6:32 pm - Dave: Raya getting some heat from pundits
8/10/23, 6:32 pm - Liam: Needs to be pulled
8/10/23, 6:33 pm - Liam: Ramsdale should come on.
8/10/23, 6:34 pm - Dave: MARTINELLI BOOM
8/10/23, 6:54 pm - Dave: The ref really is on city payroll… wow
8/10/23, 6:58 pm - Dave: https://theathletic.com/4922732/2023/10/03/referees-var-diaz-liverpool/
8/10/23, 7:26 pm - Dave: City DICKED ✅✅✅✅✅
8/10/23, 7:26 pm - Dave: Beaten them twice this season already, we’re the best team in England 🔴⚪️
8/10/23, 7:35 pm - Pero: You ripppeeerrrr !!!
8/10/23, 8:35 pm - James: Well done Arsenal
8/10/23, 8:36 pm - James: Absolutely dominated West Ham should have seen it through. Isak is class. What a second goal
8/10/23, 8:36 pm - James: Did Varpool only draw to a team that Villa beat 6-1!?
8/10/23, 8:36 pm - James: Is the game going to be replayed?
8/10/23, 8:36 pm - James: Can someone please confirm
8/10/23, 8:43 pm - James: I think you should at least float the idea. That's what happens now
8/10/23, 10:03 pm - James: What happened?
8/10/23, 10:06 pm - Dave: Van djik blunder for first Brighton goal and van djik handball which they didn’t give
8/10/23, 10:12 pm - James: Back to his best
8/10/23, 10:14 pm - James: 1pt from 6
8/10/23, 11:19 pm - Gerrard: Don't get caught by a freeze frame, I know you're on a high at the moment
8/10/23, 11:20 pm - Gerrard: Brighton manager should've been sent off
8/10/23, 11:21 pm - Gerrard: Damn, I wish we thought to use this when Newy were 0pts from 12, missed opportunity....
8/10/23, 11:22 pm - Liam: What he do? He is very mouthy.
8/10/23, 11:22 pm - Gerrard: Yeah, got a yellow and then kept telling at the 4th, Klopp had to calm him down - what a guy
8/10/23, 11:23 pm - Dave: Jesus you know you’ve taken it too far when even klopp is telling you to reign it in 😂😂😂
8/10/23, 11:23 pm - Dave: So it wasn’t a handball?
8/10/23, 11:23 pm - Dave: I’m so over the officials, they’re shite
8/10/23, 11:23 pm - Gerrard: Giving it the hold back and "he's not worth it" vibes lol
8/10/23, 11:24 pm - Dave: “Let me at ‘em”
8/10/23, 11:24 pm - Dave: Kovavic was 1000% on a red today
8/10/23, 11:24 pm - Gerrard: He blocked a shot with his thigh and it flicked up a split sec after it
8/10/23, 11:24 pm - James: Varpool got away with one again @14244893404?
8/10/23, 11:24 pm - Dave: He should have got a red for the first challenge he made on odegaard
8/10/23, 11:24 pm - James: I don't watch highlights of mid teams unless we play them so haven't seen it
8/10/23, 11:25 pm - Dave: Could have been a career ended injury, came in from behind studs up straight on odegaards ankle. Red all day long
8/10/23, 11:25 pm - Gerrard: Look at him trying to make us forget Newy bottled it last night lol
8/10/23, 11:26 pm - Dave: Then he did it to rice 5 mins later
8/10/23, 11:26 pm - Dave: https://x.com/meninblazers/status/1711049873456353705?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
8/10/23, 11:26 pm - James: @14244893404 what do you think of Varpool now that they only got one point from Spurs and Brighton?
8/10/23, 11:27 pm - James: @14244893404 matchday 10 is fast approaching
8/10/23, 11:28 pm - Dave: I think liverpool should have come away with something at spurs. Think spurs got off very lightly, liverpool were the better side and deserved a point. Reffing was woeful in that game
8/10/23, 11:28 pm - Dave: Didn’t watch the game today against Brighton
8/10/23, 11:28 pm - James: Can say that about a lot of teams
8/10/23, 11:29 pm - Dave: I don’t think Liverpool are winning anything this season though, no
8/10/23, 11:29 pm - James: Not just exclusive to varpool although they like to think the world is against them
8/10/23, 11:29 pm - James: @14244893404 they look like a two man team. Alisson and Salah
8/10/23, 11:30 pm - Liam: Just watched the highlights
8/10/23, 11:30 pm - Dave: I think it’s between us and city. Think spurs will drop off, they’re on borrowed time. Newcastle will be back in the mixer. Hammers are a tricky side. I think liverpool are back in top 4 again this season
8/10/23, 11:31 pm - Dave: Ultimately, I think city will win it. Rodri and KDB come back and we’re all fucked again
8/10/23, 11:31 pm - Dave: Saying that though, we are without Saka and Martinelli. See the difference martinelli made when he came on today. Won us the game
8/10/23, 11:32 pm - James: Lots of injuries same as us. Gordon, Wilson, Joelinton, Willock, Botman and Barnes all out
8/10/23, 11:32 pm - James: Still very pleased with this
8/10/23, 11:32 pm - Dave: Good run of results considering injuries
8/10/23, 11:33 pm - Dave: And relegation battlers two years ago
8/10/23, 11:33 pm - James: Should have beat West Ham too but one point is good at their place with how they've started <This message was edited>
8/10/23, 11:33 pm - Dave: They’re bastards to play. Really dig in
8/10/23, 11:35 pm - James: No possession. Low block and good at set peices
9/10/23, 12:12 am - James: No sledge. But why do you think the title is between you and Citeh when you didn't think that prior to the game and you had said you haven't looked good all season?
9/10/23, 12:13 am - James: If we're calling you title challengers because you beat them than can't we say the same about Wolves?
9/10/23, 12:15 am - Dave: I think city will win it. But if you ask me who I think has a chance, and when I say a chance, I mean like a 2-3% long shot chance of toppling city this season, I’d say it’s us
9/10/23, 12:17 am - Dave: We’re unbeaten this season and have beaten city twice on the trot. 

I don’t think we look as good as we did at the start of last season - but I think a lot of that’s because of injuries and Arteta having to change it up tactically since teams adapted to counter against our pressing play. That was an Arsenal masterclass today with a weakened team, defensively we were great minus a couple of Raya clangers. Saliba and
Gabby snuffed out everything city had to throw at us
9/10/23, 12:18 am - James: Having a solid defence is the key
9/10/23, 12:18 am - Dave: We’re weakened in the final third at the moment which is why we’re not winning more. We rely on saka and martinelli too heavily and it shows right now. Need to improve there for sure
9/10/23, 12:18 am - Dave: But arsenal midfield totally controlled the game today. Steamrolled city midfield
9/10/23, 12:19 am - James: Why sign Phillips
9/10/23, 12:19 am - James: Citeh had Stones out too
9/10/23, 12:19 am - Dave: I’ve heard that rumour, I’ll be fuming if we do
9/10/23, 12:19 am - James: No, I mean why didn't pep
9/10/23, 12:19 am - Liam: Stones came on
9/10/23, 12:19 am - James: He had no number 6
9/10/23, 12:20 am - James: Must have been his first appearance of the season
9/10/23, 12:20 am - James: Why didn't Arsenal look at the Endo fella
9/10/23, 12:20 am - Dave: Oh, my mate text me the other day saying Arsenal were interested in phillips
9/10/23, 12:20 am - James: Or Gravenberch?
9/10/23, 12:21 am - Dave: Not good enough
9/10/23, 12:21 am - Dave: Arteta buys world class record breaking defensive mids, not second tier 37 year olds
9/10/23, 12:21 am - Liam: Partey rice odegaard, I think is the best midfield in the league
9/10/23, 12:22 am - James: I think citeh have
9/10/23, 12:24 am - Liam: Who is this
9/10/23, 12:24 am - James: Hang on, that Endo isn't 37 is he 😂
9/10/23, 12:25 am - Dave: 34?
9/10/23, 12:25 am - Dave: @61478754484 how old is endo?
9/10/23, 12:26 am - Liam: I’m sorry, I have no idea what a
Endo is……Enzo?
9/10/23, 12:26 am - James: Best Dutch player at Varpool according to Robertson
9/10/23, 12:27 am - James: No he went to Chelsea instead
9/10/23, 12:27 am - Liam: Is he the one that missed a open goal this morning?
9/10/23, 12:28 am - James: I haven't seen this. Do you have a clip?
9/10/23, 12:29 am - Liam: https://x.com/keilfc8/status/1711032593955930606?s=48&t=2H6WZBte1Bbl316U4Om7qA
9/10/23, 12:30 am - Dave: Harder to miss than score there 🤯
9/10/23, 12:33 am - Gerrard: No consistency
9/10/23, 12:33 am - Gerrard: I thought the Brighton defender should've got red for that penalty for not playing the ball at all on a goal scoring opp
9/10/23, 12:34 am - Gerrard: Szlob was in front of the keeper and trying to shoot as the defender grabbed the back of his collar and dragged him down.
9/10/23, 12:35 am - Gerrard: Brutal eh, that was the 3-1 win there
9/10/23, 12:36 am - Gerrard: @61478754484 @14244893404 my teammates saying it was two studs challenges in quick succession that weren't reds
9/10/23, 12:39 am - Gerrard: @61452662705
9/10/23, 12:40 am - Gerrard changed the group name from "Real Liverpool Pats Chat" to "Weekly Refereeing Group Chat"
9/10/23, 12:40 am - Gerrard changed this group's icon
9/10/23, 12:48 am - Gerrard: Worst thing about the game was they didn't play Milner
9/10/23, 12:48 am - Jono: We’d have probably started Jimmy as our 6
9/10/23, 12:49 am - Gerrard: That's just you being anti Argie
9/10/23, 12:49 am - Jono: He’s not a 6 unfortunately
9/10/23, 12:50 am - Jono: Felt sorry for him
9/10/23, 12:50 am - Gerrard: 2nd half he was good, 1st horrible
9/10/23, 12:51 am - Gerrard: Still can't believe Trent was good defensively lol

9/10/23, 12:58 am - Dave: Did you see our ref?
9/10/23, 12:59 am - Dave: Where he’s been contracting to? @61409710717
9/10/23, 1:00 am - Gerrard: UAE?
9/10/23, 1:01 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CyJQM6vACKR/?igshid=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==
9/10/23, 1:03 am - Gerrard: Nice spin 👍🏻
9/10/23, 1:26 am - Dave: Yea. Cunts getting paid big bucks by citehs sugar daddy on the side and comes back to the day job at the prem
9/10/23, 1:26 am - Dave: Should be illegal
9/10/23, 1:27 am - Dave: Kovacic should have got a red for the first. Let alone second. Outrageous. I’m seething 😂😂
9/10/23, 1:42 am - Gerrard: Suss
9/10/23, 2:06 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/hSE_LjRGhko?si=M7QHERh6DSlNchcl
@61404487873
9/10/23, 2:10 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 just saw the highlights, love a deflection BUT you ok with the way Arteta celebrated?
9/10/23, 2:42 am - Gerrard: Next North London Derby a title decider?
9/10/23, 2:42 am - Gerrard: Has that ever been said before?
9/10/23, 2:52 am - Wilson: The last 3-4 days I muted this chat... lol
9/10/23, 2:53 am - Jono: I would too with all the @61452662705 dribble
9/10/23, 2:55 am - Dave: Why wouldn’t I be? We haven’t beaten city in the league since 2015
9/10/23, 2:57 am - James: It's OK, the Varpool lovin wankfest has eased down since they only picked up 1pt from a possible 6 🫠
9/10/23, 2:57 am - Dave: Doubt it. Spurs are shit
9/10/23, 2:59 am - Dave: Have to give it to you jimmy, you did say the wheels would come off in these two last games <This message was edited>
9/10/23, 3:00 am - James: Heads gone there and in here it seems 😁
9/10/23, 3:01 am - James: Gotta watch out through, Varpool have the future POTY in midfield 😂
9/10/23, 3:30 am - Gerrard: I've had it muted for months
9/10/23, 3:31 am - Gerrard: Only the goal I mean
9/10/23, 3:31 am - Gerrard: Hardly, stop baiting him
9/10/23, 3:34 am - James: 1pt from 6!?
9/10/23, 3:34 am - James: Varpool fans really are deluded aren't they
9/10/23, 5:23 am - James: Who is that at the top there?
9/10/23, 5:23 am - Gerrard: Rodders don't be a Jimmy, fucked by the refs and a draw at Brighton doesn't qualify Jimmy as right.
He said Brighton 3-0 and Bright 5-1.
9/10/23, 5:23 am - James: Hang on, Chelsea are in better form than Varpool!? 🫨
9/10/23, 5:24 am - Gerrard: What about the first 8 games?
9/10/23, 5:24 am - Gerrard: Let's do it over the 3 games Newy lost in a row
9/10/23, 5:25 am - Gerrard: Form sledges, peak D'Jimi
9/10/23, 5:25 am - James: Are we approaching game 10 Jezzy?
9/10/23, 5:25 am - Gerrard: Is 10 games the trigger for judgement?
9/10/23, 5:25 am - James: Since you like looking at tables in October (😂) Have you seen the other table in the other competition we are competing in?
9/10/23, 5:26 am - James: You know that one you're not good enough to compete in this season?
9/10/23, 5:26 am - James: Even with the future POTY?
9/10/23, 5:26 am - Gerrard: @61478754484 @14244893404 do you understand anything this guy says?
9/10/23, 5:27 am - James: Let's not brush over the fact Caceido's Chelsea are looking better than Varpool now
9/10/23, 5:27 am - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
9/10/23, 5:27 am - Gerrard: This is getting worse each round of the PL
9/10/23, 5:28 am - James: Like Varpools performances 😂
9/10/23, 5:28 am - James: ⬇️🔜
9/10/23, 5:29 am - Gerrard: This is what I was talking about having Jimmy in a group chat, he talks so much shite and dribble that everyone mutes the chat and no one participates in the group.
9/10/23, 5:29 am - Dave: Chelsea have been 🔥 recently to be fair
9/10/23, 5:29 am - James: I also have it on mute and just wait till I catch a nice big fish 🐠
9/10/23, 5:30 am - Gerrard: Might have to start another one
9/10/23, 5:30 am - Gerrard: Just keep tranferring
9/10/23, 5:30 am - James: @14244893404 you want to join another Varpool wankfest chat
9/10/23, 5:31 am - James: You can talk about pep and how sexy slobby is
9/10/23, 5:31 am - Gerrard: I come to this chat for real football talk, then it's like old making up stuff to try and fail to get a rise.
Am I wrong?
9/10/23, 5:31 am - Gerrard: *old mate
9/10/23, 5:32 am - Gerrard: I just don't see the point anymore, I thought he'd change once Liverpool started playing well again and Livo were above Newty again.
🤷🏼‍♂️
9/10/23, 5:35 am - Dave: We can talk about how well Arsenal played today if you want
9/10/23, 5:36 am - Dave: I can’t stop thinking about it
9/10/23, 5:36 am - Dave: Think I’ve got the hots for arteta 😋
9/10/23, 5:37 am - Gerrard: Perfect
9/10/23, 5:38 am - Gerrard: The Pitchside boys were saying winning when not playing well
9/10/23, 5:38 am - Gerrard: How did it look?
9/10/23, 5:38 am - Liam: It’s wasn’t pretty
9/10/23, 5:39 am - Liam: Working hard at nullifying each other more than anything
9/10/23, 5:39 am - Liam: I wasn’t a great watch
9/10/23, 5:39 am - James: They're better than people think. Just haven't been taking their chances until recently
9/10/23, 5:40 am - Liam: But I prefer that, than getting smashed 0-3
9/10/23, 5:40 am - Dave: I think it was, arteta masterclass
9/10/23, 5:40 am - Dave: Didn’t let city in
9/10/23, 5:40 am - Liam: It was
9/10/23, 5:40 am - James: Caceido must be chuffed now tbf
9/10/23, 5:40 am - Dave: Boring to watch, sure
9/10/23, 5:40 am - Dave: Not the exciting fast paced high pressing football of last season
9/10/23, 5:41 am - Liam: Oh god ya
9/10/23, 5:41 am - Dave: But this kind of play may win us something
9/10/23, 5:42 am - Dave: Crazy how dominant city have been
9/10/23, 5:42 am - Dave: Today was the first time since December 2018 that city have lost back to back league games
9/10/23, 5:47 am - Dave: Liverpool have got a lovely run of fixtures for the next couple of months
9/10/23, 5:47 am - Dave: May be top at Christmas
9/10/23, 5:49 am - James: You'd never hear the end of it
9/10/23, 5:49 am - James: You're not supposed to brag about things like that. Remember what Jezzy said last season
9/10/23, 5:51 am - Liam: https://youtu.be/240ONYdn2ag?si=IEgraUF703OrjSks
9/10/23, 5:51 am - Liam: Worlds best fans?
9/10/23, 5:52 am - Dave: The emirates has no atmosphere!
9/10/23, 5:54 am - James: Better than Anfield 💯
9/10/23, 6:00 am - Dave: This message was deleted

9/10/23, 6:22 am - James: @14244893404 did you see MacAllistars fuck up for the Brighton goal 😂😂😂
9/10/23, 6:23 am - James: Some signing he's been so far
9/10/23, 6:25 am - Dave: No?
9/10/23, 6:26 am - Jono: You probably didn’t see it @14244893404 because it was actually Virgil’s fuck up
9/10/23, 6:27 am - James: MacAlistar has no awareness at all @14244893404
9/10/23, 6:28 am - Gerrard: Break KDB and Rodri then they're not as invulnerable as they think
9/10/23, 6:28 am - James: Simple pass played to him and he isn't switched on as usual
9/10/23, 6:28 am - Gerrard: Yeah I thought the same but Mac was flat-footed, and you're supposed to trust em with someone near them
9/10/23, 6:30 am - Gerrard: But is there a little bit of sing when winning? @61478754484 I remember some dark times a few years ago
9/10/23, 6:31 am - Gerrard: Only counts where you are at come the end of 38
9/10/23, 6:31 am - Liam: Agreed
9/10/23, 6:31 am - James: Did you put that sentence through Google translate or something?
9/10/23, 6:31 am - Liam: But enjoy the ride
9/10/23, 6:32 am - Gerrard: Good that we both have teams up the top again, little bit of healthy banter come Livo v Arsenal
9/10/23, 6:32 am - James: Interesting perspectives on the table considering the general conversations around current standings after game week 8
9/10/23, 6:32 am - Gerrard: We can watch the game together @61478754484 @61404060785
9/10/23, 6:33 am - Dave: Don’t remember YNWA being sung with the same emphasis during the Carroll and skrtel era
9/10/23, 6:33 am - James: Think those boys like to watch their team live mate
9/10/23, 6:33 am - Dave: The Dalglish dopes
9/10/23, 6:33 am - James: What about last season when they were losing at home to Leeds
9/10/23, 6:33 am - Gerrard: Ah we always did, but it was through tears
9/10/23, 6:34 am - Gerrard: The Hodgson Hopeless Cunts
9/10/23, 6:35 am - Gerrard: Goldbridge going at the refs over the Arsenal game
9/10/23, 6:36 am - James: @14244893404 first the pitch side boys and now goldbridge!
9/10/23, 6:36 am - James: Wonder what pew die pie made of it all!?
9/10/23, 6:37 am - Dave: As he should be
9/10/23, 6:37 am - Dave: There should be as much outrage over this as there was in the liverpool game
9/10/23, 6:37 am - Gerrard: Agreed
9/10/23, 6:37 am - Dave: That challenge could have ended odegaards season. Torn ACL or broken ankle, was bad. Then the cunt had the audacity to do it again to rice literally straight after <This message was edited>
9/10/23, 6:37 am - Gerrard: Every week now
9/10/23, 6:37 am - Gerrard: Sick of it
9/10/23, 6:38 am - Gerrard: And I can't even enjoy that, no injury AND red card
9/10/23, 6:38 am - James: Anyone know what Mr. Beast has been saying about it?
9/10/23, 6:40 am - Dave: I’m kind of glad we beat them with 11 men and odegaard wasn’t injred. Best outcome for us. “Oh you beat 10 men well done”
9/10/23, 6:40 am - Dave: At least we beat them and when we both have a pile of injuries
9/10/23, 6:45 am - James: Two defeats in a row for citeh now. If they carry on like that they might get relegated
9/10/23, 6:53 am - Gerrard: I would've loved an oddergard injury, no offence

9/10/23, 7:17 am - Gerrard: @61478754484 @14244893404 did you see Harvey Elliot realise he's not paid enough to take important shots on Liverpool's first goal?
9/10/23, 4:14 pm - Dave: No?

9/10/23, 10:53 pm - Gerrard: Refs are worse than Hamas
9/10/23, 10:55 pm - Liam: HumASS
9/10/23, 11:13 pm - Dave: Lads, hear me out here, we’ve got some cutting edge technology, we’ve attached a moped engine to a commercial grade fan and bolted a seat to it. It’ll be fun!
9/10/23, 11:14 pm - Dave: Bet that gives you nightmares @61409710717
9/10/23, 11:15 pm - James: Resourceful
9/10/23, 11:27 pm - Jono: Madders is funny cunt
10/10/23, 12:39 am - Gerrard: "Also, fuck war." Nice one
10/10/23, 4:22 am - Jono: Disclaimer
10/10/23, 4:22 am - Jono: In case I offended anyone
10/10/23, 4:27 am - Dave: You offended @61452662705. He loves war, starts one in here every day
10/10/23, 4:29 am - Gerrard: He's just trying to distract from his daily war, give him a break ❤️
10/10/23, 4:30 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 you can talk shit about Livo to me til your heart's content ❤️
10/10/23, 5:18 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 surprise surprise
10/10/23, 5:19 am - Jono: Another cup to boycott @61409710717
10/10/23, 5:19 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/-0kcet4aPpQ?si=CE47GAEIK6T9yUy0
10/10/23, 5:19 am - Gerrard: Fin A
10/10/23, 5:20 am - Gerrard: I'm gonna boycott the CL if Newy make it out the group.
10/10/23, 5:22 am - Jono: Rico suave
10/10/23, 5:22 am - Jono: Not mucking around - youthful exuberance
10/10/23, 5:25 am - Gerrard: Was that to Arsenal fans?
10/10/23, 5:25 am - Gerrard: What a tit
10/10/23, 5:25 am - Jono: Yep
10/10/23, 5:25 am - Gerrard: This is like when a reserve keeper talks shit
10/10/23, 5:45 am - Dave: Like Alisson for you. Liverpool are a bottom half club without him <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 5:50 am - Liam: Oh he’s amazing
10/10/23, 5:50 am - Gerrard: Whoa
10/10/23, 5:50 am - Gerrard: Why do defensive
10/10/23, 5:53 am - Gerrard: *so
10/10/23, 6:03 am - Dave: World class
10/10/23, 6:18 am - Gerrard: Madrid calling?
They been playing centre mids as centre backs.
10/10/23, 6:24 am - Liam: New contract signed 🥲
10/10/23, 6:26 am - Gerrard: You'll get absolute bank then
10/10/23, 7:26 am - Dave: Saudi came for Gabriel and Arsenal turned down 100m. Won’t sell Saliba for shit
10/10/23, 7:34 am - Gerrard: Don't forget player power, look at Gordon Everton to Newy
10/10/23, 7:42 am - Liam: No wants to leave arsenal 🤷🏻‍♂️fighting to stay

10/10/23, 11:50 am - Gerrard: Rory curse
10/10/23, 11:50 am - Gerrard: Well he's right about Haaland but a season late, right?

11/10/23, 1:36 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 take him at Arsenal?
11/10/23, 1:58 am - Dave: In a heartbeat
11/10/23, 2:12 am - Gerrard: Poor Eddie
11/10/23, 4:05 am - James: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 4:17 am - Liam: What’s going on
11/10/23, 4:40 am - James: Pep is showing off his trophies in Bondi
11/10/23, 4:40 am - James: @61409710717
11/10/23, 4:45 am - James: Against Arsenal who finished second. Hattrick against manure who finished third and one against us who finished fourth?
11/10/23, 4:47 am - Gerrard: Replicas?
I know the CL will be
11/10/23, 4:47 am - James: I asked that but apparently all real
11/10/23, 4:47 am - Gerrard: Not enough, score in some big games.
Zero goals in finals.
11/10/23, 4:48 am - James: Heading to Parramatta as well
11/10/23, 4:48 am - Gerrard: They don't let you take home the CL unless you win three in a row or 5 total
11/10/23, 4:48 am - Gerrard: It'll be the one they have for the trophy room
11/10/23, 4:49 am - James: I thought you keep the trophy and they make a new one. When you win it you have it for the season?
11/10/23, 4:49 am - Gerrard: Not sure how long they let you hold it but in the end you get a replica.
If the 3 or 5 happens then they make a new real one.
11/10/23, 4:50 am - Gerrard: Not sure if this has changed recently
11/10/23, 4:52 am - James: I thought they redesigned the whole thing if you won it a set amount of times and let the team who has won it x amount of times keep the real one. Can't do because it hasn't changed even when Madrid won
11/10/23, 4:52 am - James: Think they won three in a row
11/10/23, 5:34 am - Gerrard: Never heard of redesign but a new one gets made.
If it's just one win it's like the ice hockey, Stanley Cup, you win it and get to parade it for a bit but then it gets your names engraved on and sent back to the association.
11/10/23, 5:39 am - Gerrard: So Liverpool have 5 copies and 1 original (made 1993)
11/10/23, 5:40 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 @61422023136 @61478754484 
Why haven't we heard from PGMOL about the City game yet?
11/10/23, 5:42 am - Liam: Payroll
11/10/23, 5:42 am - Liam: Newy and city should be kicked from the league
11/10/23, 5:46 am - Dave: Not going to ruin a good thing are they
11/10/23, 5:47 am - Gerrard: Lol they got off because Arsenal ended up winning
11/10/23, 5:47 am - Dave: Own up to that one and they lose their slice of the pie in the Middle East
11/10/23, 5:48 am - Gerrard: You reckon we'd make money creating content on all the referring mistakes each week?
11/10/23, 5:51 am - Gerrard: https://www.espn.com.au/football/story/_/id/38580586/the-var-review-mateo-kovacic-pascal-gross-red-cards-virgil-van-dijk-penalty
Don't trust who wrote this up, looks like all our teams had incidents
11/10/23, 5:52 am - Gerrard: "clear and obvious error" is the most fucked up part of all these VAR rules.
Compare Jones and Kovacic ruling to why the VAR did or didn't get involved.
11/10/23, 6:07 am - James: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 6:07 am - James: Where's Emirates?
11/10/23, 6:17 am - James: https://youtube.com/shorts/a-zIBc27y44?feature=shared
11/10/23, 6:36 am - Dave: Only two London stadiums were allowed.  Spurs brand new stadium is better than emirates and the other is Wembley
11/10/23, 6:36 am - Dave: Apparently anfield the pitch is too small 😂
11/10/23, 6:36 am - James: Where's Anfield?
11/10/23, 6:37 am - Dave: Pitch too small and no big screen tv
11/10/23, 6:37 am - Dave: Not a surpise. Scared their fans will nick it
11/10/23, 6:59 am - Gerrard: Too classic for the trendy euros
11/10/23, 7:00 am - Jono: Fuck the Euros
11/10/23, 7:06 am - Dave: Heard the toons oil money got them a slice of the pie
11/10/23, 7:07 am - Gerrard: Euro snops
11/10/23, 7:07 am - Gerrard: Oh 💯
11/10/23, 7:08 am - Jono: Without doubt
11/10/23, 7:08 am - Gerrard: Did Hampton Park get in?
11/10/23, 7:08 am - Gerrard: Hampden
11/10/23, 7:08 am - Dave: Ya
11/10/23, 7:08 am - Gerrard: I would love to experience that one day
11/10/23, 7:13 am - Gerrard: Also going to a Irish Rugby national game in dublin
11/10/23, 7:13 am - Gerrard: Jesus they're gonna make people go to Belfast
11/10/23, 7:16 am - James: Everton is in Liverpool and they choose Everton?
11/10/23, 7:16 am - James: Everton fans less feral @14244893404?
11/10/23, 7:17 am - James: All the contentious VAR decisions they get there

12/10/23, 6:12 am - James: Too much of a football obsessed geek to only get to manage six games a year
12/10/23, 6:13 am - James: I bet Southgate doesn't get a top six job in England
12/10/23, 6:13 am - Gerrard: That would be an easy out for the Saudis to get a tier 1 manager in.

12/10/23, 6:15 am - James: No I just don't think young managers would want to
12/10/23, 6:16 am - James: Southgate only got it by default because big sam was corrupt

19/10/23, 7:35 am - Gerrard: *posting
19/10/23, 7:35 am - James: Rated higher!?!
19/10/23, 7:36 am - Gerrard: You read?
19/10/23, 7:36 am - James: I'll email them now
19/10/23, 7:36 am - Gerrard: "premier league"
19/10/23, 7:36 am - James: Get it set straight
19/10/23, 7:36 am - James: Where is sloboy
19/10/23, 7:36 am - Gerrard: Below Rodri Wardy and Maddi
19/10/23, 7:37 am - Gerrard: I thought that was obvious
19/10/23, 7:38 am - James: Roberson still lower than burn in all comps and Robbie plays in farmer euro league and burn is a CL left back 😭
19/10/23, 7:38 am - James: And the others lol
19/10/23, 7:39 am - Gerrard: Wow going hard with stat pages today
19/10/23, 7:39 am - Gerrard: Jimmy the Stat Man
19/10/23, 7:39 am - James: I was just bemused why Robbie was in there
19/10/23, 7:39 am - James: Just a bit of fact checking mate
19/10/23, 7:39 am - Gerrard: As we all were about Flash
19/10/23, 7:39 am - James: It's good to check things
19/10/23, 7:40 am - Gerrard: Check the table
19/10/23, 7:40 am - James: Oh no 😭
19/10/23, 7:40 am - James: The Varpool fan is looking at the table 8 games in now
19/10/23, 7:41 am - James: How the 'mighty' have fallen
19/10/23, 7:41 am - James: Worse than Christmas champions arsenal
19/10/23, 7:41 am - James: Make a t shirt about it
19/10/23, 7:41 am - James: Sell like hotcakes
19/10/23, 7:41 am - James: I say sell, more likely stolen
19/10/23, 7:41 am - Gerrard: Hey guys, no one check the table until the last game is finished OR if Newy are about Liverpool
19/10/23, 7:42 am - James: 30 games to go
19/10/23, 7:53 am - Jono: Knock a man while he's down @61452662705
19/10/23, 7:54 am - James: How long is he out
19/10/23, 7:55 am - Jono: 10 weeks
19/10/23, 7:57 am - James: Going to Greggs now too. He'll be a balloon by the time his shoulder has healed if he's not careful
19/10/23, 12:38 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/WK9QwTgzMaA?si=vpu9KDZyhj1GDFeU
19/10/23, 11:15 pm - James: https://x.com/LukeEdwardsTele/status/1714957896096612614?s=08
19/10/23, 11:15 pm - James: Why don't the FA look at Steve Bruce?
19/10/23, 11:17 pm - Dave: Why don’t Newcastle?
19/10/23, 11:17 pm - James: When arteta gets sacked... Bruce?
19/10/23, 11:18 pm - James: "One of the most important managers in world football"
19/10/23, 11:19 pm - Dave: Why’s Arteta getting sacked?
19/10/23, 11:20 pm - James: When
19/10/23, 11:38 pm - Dave: Behave. Oracle ❤️
19/10/23, 11:42 pm - Gerrard: This is like me saying I don't want to date Margot Robbie
19/10/23, 11:47 pm - James: You can do better
19/10/23, 11:47 pm - Gerrard: I really can't
19/10/23, 11:48 pm - Jono: Surprised they’re doing this
20/10/23, 1:01 am - Gerrard: Mate, I've been having this discussion with journalists in FM for the last 10yrs
20/10/23, 2:19 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/TfiHC0UmoPE?si=WMBWB0DcQUakX5hK
Rory update for @61452662705
20/10/23, 2:49 am - James: 31st Dec to 14th Jan no games
20/10/23, 2:49 am - James: There two breaks or Talkshite messed the dates up?
20/10/23, 3:10 am - Dave: And it starts
20/10/23, 3:35 am - Dave: This is going to ruffle so many feathers. Watch the rest of the league kick off 😂 the perfect FFP loophole
20/10/23, 3:36 am - James: Neves to Newcastle confirmed ✅
20/10/23, 4:02 am - James: What's the issue?
20/10/23, 4:04 am - Jono: I would’ve thought Neymar’s injury might have stopped this
20/10/23, 4:04 am - Jono: But no real surprise
20/10/23, 4:26 am - Dave: Good troll
20/10/23, 4:32 am - James: Explain? Loads of clubs exchange players
20/10/23, 4:46 am - Dave: So Saudi Arabia load up on the big ticket players in their domestic leagues totally circumventing FFP, then loan said players out on the cheap to their club in the premier league constricted by FFP
20/10/23, 4:47 am - Dave: Inks barely dried on Neves contract and he’s already going “out on loan”
20/10/23, 4:48 am - James: Salzburg and leipzig
Udinese and Watford
20/10/23, 4:48 am - James: What's the problem
20/10/23, 4:48 am - James: Wasn't an issue before?
20/10/23, 4:49 am - James: Citeh group exchange players too
20/10/23, 4:50 am - Dave: No one cares about those clubs. Big money at stake now. This will blow up if Neves goes on loan to you, guarantee it
20/10/23, 4:50 am - James: By who?
20/10/23, 4:51 am - Dave: So you don’t think it’ll be an issue?
20/10/23, 4:51 am - James: What they gunna do about it
20/10/23, 4:51 am - James: Cry?
20/10/23, 4:52 am - James: Na
20/10/23, 4:52 am - James: What's the issue anyway
20/10/23, 4:52 am - Gerrard: Oscar nominee for Jimmy pretending he wouldn't be against this if it wasn't Newty
20/10/23, 4:53 am - Gerrard: *nomination
20/10/23, 4:53 am - James: I'm white straight male, no nomination for me
20/10/23, 4:54 am - Gerrard: Thought you went non binary
20/10/23, 4:55 am - Gerrard: Tam got me last night because I said I set my bumble to include non binaries because I "didn't want to exclude any hot non binary chicks"
20/10/23, 4:55 am - Gerrard: Apparently they're not "chicks"
20/10/23, 4:56 am - Gerrard: #bigot
20/10/23, 4:56 am - James: You don't want this
20/10/23, 4:58 am - Gerrard: Then she didn't give me any credit for calling a trans chick a "her"
20/10/23, 5:07 am - James: Have you thought about exploring that market space yet?
20/10/23, 5:36 am - Gerrard: Maybe post and maybe just let them suck me off, not sure how many would be keen on just that lol
20/10/23, 5:37 am - James: Can only ask
20/10/23, 5:37 am - Gerrard: No harm
20/10/23, 5:42 am - Dave: Think birds are the correct terminology mate
20/10/23, 5:43 am - Dave: Gez would eat that space up. Be a feeding frenzy <This message was edited>
20/10/23, 5:43 am - Gerrard: Not the ones that look like you in a wig and skirt
20/10/23, 5:44 am - Gerrard: I mean the ones that make you say "no way that's a dude"
20/10/23, 5:44 am - Dave: Especially the ones that look like me. Mardis gras gez in the house
20/10/23, 5:44 am - Dave: Plenty of those in Thailand. Better looking than the women half the time.
20/10/23, 5:47 am - Gerrard: *Everyone* Dave is trying to change the narrative of what happened that night every time it comes up.
I went cheek and he did that sleazy thing creeps do where they try to work their way round to your lips.
I feel violated and I'm finally speaking up about his sexual crimes.
#metoo
20/10/23, 5:56 am - Dave: You see, how I remember it is turning up to meet you and you being stood awkwardly with a very strange girl you’d met on Tinder next to you. 

She told me she was a photographer and doing a project, I asked how I could feature in her project and she replied “be gay”. Then you tried planting one on me in the middle of the pub 🤷🏼‍♂️
20/10/23, 5:57 am - Gerrard: Funny how the English distort the truth
20/10/23, 5:57 am - Gerrard: Where's the part about me being on shrooms and you bring a drunken mess
20/10/23, 5:58 am - Gerrard: *being
20/10/23, 5:59 am - Dave: You were stone sober
20/10/23, 5:59 am - Dave: Racist
20/10/23, 6:00 am - Gerrard: BAM snookered, I was stone sober while at a bar on Mardi Gras?! No one gonna believe that.
20/10/23, 6:07 am - Dave: Our hero ❤️
20/10/23, 6:15 am - James: I'm free October 8th
20/10/23, 6:24 am - Gerrard: Where's Norootvember?
20/10/23, 6:30 am - Pero: I wonder what they do in august
20/10/23, 6:31 am - James: Judging by all the remembrance days they have I assume that's when they get bashed
20/10/23, 6:33 am - Pero: Hahaha gives them time to get stitched up and cosmetic repairs from the beatings
20/10/23, 6:38 am - James: Win win situation for them. Bigger boobs next time
20/10/23, 7:25 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/nOjYw8D61MI?si=nuWz9yHXEStfR_W3
20/10/23, 7:28 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/aeSDTJbe7E8?si=ldCt5KUtTesyDjl3
20/10/23, 7:45 am - James: It's OK we getting neves for free in Jan 👌
20/10/23, 7:53 am - Gerrard: Longstaff innit
20/10/23, 10:50 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/LlowEAk5GAc?si=8d2sHxTDhbKIrJOx
21/10/23, 6:14 pm - Dave: 😂😂😂😂😂 https://x.com/barnabyslater/status/1715724331349676091?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
21/10/23, 6:30 pm - James: 100% red
21/10/23, 6:38 pm - Dave: Have seen fans blowing up all over Twitter due to the officiating in Liverpools favour so it looks like business as usual after that one game of injustice against Spurs
21/10/23, 6:41 pm - Dave: Classic @61452662705. Shocked I didn’t wake up to 409 messages in this group talking about the injustices of premier league reffing and how we’ve got to “band together” against Refs and VAR 🤷🏼‍♂️
21/10/23, 10:03 pm - Jono: Going off Twitterati for justification is an interesting move lol
21/10/23, 10:05 pm - Jono: The ball was already back at a Liverpool player anyway prior to the contact from Konate, probably played into the decision to make it a foul only. Anyway, we fucking dominated them and Everton are shit stains on the PL for how they play the game
21/10/23, 10:05 pm - Jono: Justice served for good quality football and for Sean Dyche to fuck off to the championship
21/10/23, 11:09 pm - Chris: He won't go though. He got relegated with Burnley, but yet he finds a way to stay up. He's like a fly that gets stuck in your house and it can't find its way out
21/10/23, 11:43 pm - Jono: Could’ve really done without 9 minutes added time…
22/10/23, 1:00 am - Pero: #rayaout
22/10/23, 1:10 am - James: Wilson scored seconds before he was going to get subbed for Isak 😂
22/10/23, 1:12 am - James: @14244893404 what's the jist of the unread messages I have here. Varpool fans given it the biggun because they beat the leagues worst team?
22/10/23, 2:40 am - James: Mudeyk was 100% a cross
22/10/23, 2:46 am - Jono: Celebrated like he meant it
22/10/23, 2:49 am - Dave: “Mudryk has entered the premier league with a world class goal that defies gravity” FUCK OFF 😂😂😂
22/10/23, 2:51 am - Dave: Beat the leagues worst team with 12 men on their side. Then klippity had a mental breakdown when he got asked if Everton should be allowed to replay the game
22/10/23, 2:58 am - James: Penalty and last minute sealer 🫠
22/10/23, 3:10 am - Pero: Klopp should be happy getting the early game it gives that 4 hour window to look like they are top of the league
22/10/23, 3:32 am - Gerrard: Don't think anyone gave it the biggun, we played like shit
22/10/23, 3:33 am - Gerrard: Exactly 💦
22/10/23, 3:38 am - James: Spurs will soon slip
22/10/23, 3:38 am - Gerrard: Lol why you counting Newy in this calc?
22/10/23, 3:38 am - James: Top five CL
22/10/23, 3:38 am - Gerrard: Lol ok ok
22/10/23, 3:38 am - James: Varsenal drawing a lot
22/10/23, 3:39 am - Gerrard: NewVARy on the first goal?
22/10/23, 3:39 am - James: Miles on
22/10/23, 3:39 am - James: And he meant it
22/10/23, 3:39 am - James: Doesn't work either
22/10/23, 3:41 am - Gerrard: I thought in chat we just claim VAR bias right or wrong calls 🤷🏼‍♂️
22/10/23, 3:41 am - Gerrard: *this chat
22/10/23, 3:57 am - Gerrard: Wow, I just saw the highlights, so lucky to get that draw, Chelsea gifting them a point
22/10/23, 4:00 am - Dave: Actually really happy with our performances this season. Look a lot calmer and more settled than last year. Got the depth and resilience now to just dig deep and get a result
22/10/23, 4:01 am - Dave: Raya was shaky for half the game. Few blunders
22/10/23, 4:02 am - James: Drawsenal
22/10/23, 4:02 am - Gerrard: Guys, watch the Forrest v Luton highlights.
1. Chris Wood superstar after breaking off the Newy shackles.
2. Aurier absolute numpty defending.
3. Noice Luton comeback.
22/10/23, 4:03 am - Gerrard: They could go invincible this season, but these days that points tally might get you 5th
22/10/23, 4:05 am - James: Raya out?
22/10/23, 4:05 am - Gerrard: They've already burnt the bridge with Aaron
22/10/23, 4:05 am - Gerrard: Expert managing by Arteta
22/10/23, 4:05 am - James: I've had my fill of mid team highlights today after watching the Merseyside retards derby earlier
22/10/23, 4:05 am - Dave: Na. Still a better shot stopper than rammers.
22/10/23, 4:06 am - Dave: Imagine playing Everton at home and having to count your lucky stars after scraping a win when you’re supposedly title challengers
22/10/23, 4:06 am - James: Varpool really need Salah don't they
22/10/23, 4:06 am - Gerrard: Rent free, looking for material were ya?
22/10/23, 4:06 am - Gerrard: Expert analysis, team really needs their best player 👌🏻
22/10/23, 4:07 am - Gerrard: Start a podcast
22/10/23, 4:07 am - Dave: Salah is the beating heart of liverpool. Better hope he doesn’t bugger off in jan to Saudi
22/10/23, 4:07 am - James: Not all. Some teams have finances and depth
22/10/23, 4:07 am - James: That's happening ✅
22/10/23, 4:07 am - Gerrard: "Finances" 😂😂😂
22/10/23, 4:08 am - James: Not a good look
22/10/23, 4:10 am - Gerrard: I'm so worried after getting 3pts
22/10/23, 4:11 am - Gerrard: I'd much rather be in 5th and 5pts off the lead
22/10/23, 4:11 am - Gerrard: 😢
22/10/23, 4:14 am - Gerrard: Konate or whoever that guy is?
22/10/23, 4:14 am - Gerrard: Konate not getting sent off 💦💦💦
22/10/23, 4:28 am - James: Varpool init
22/10/23, 4:35 am - Gerrard: Lol VAR can't comment on yellow cards REMEMBER?!
22/10/23, 4:38 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CyjEwVlAVNz/?igshid=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==
22/10/23, 4:43 am - James: If only we had unlimited funds and an entire Saudi league to pick players from 😭
22/10/23, 4:43 am - Gerrard: He's actually said it!
22/10/23, 4:44 am - James: Do you think you'll sign anyone in Jan?
22/10/23, 4:44 am - James: Or have to sell to buy
22/10/23, 4:44 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/YE_Pf3z_ubw?si=DLg_W-FL7x7aATvc
Classic for seeing them all upset
22/10/23, 4:44 am - Gerrard: Not thought about it once bud
22/10/23, 4:45 am - Gerrard: Are you not happy with your team currently?
I thought they were all amazing
22/10/23, 4:46 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I can affect anything bud, just watching from Australia
22/10/23, 4:47 am - Gerrard: *can't
22/10/23, 4:49 am - James: True
22/10/23, 4:49 am - Gerrard: Such is life
22/10/23, 4:49 am - James: Butterfly effect?
22/10/23, 4:49 am - Gerrard: Now you're Australian you should have that tattooed across your back
22/10/23, 4:50 am - Gerrard: Can I use this to blame your action for my life fuck ups?
22/10/23, 4:50 am - Gerrard: *actions
22/10/23, 4:50 am - James: Technicality
22/10/23, 4:50 am - Gerrard: Noice
22/10/23, 4:51 am - James: It is actually always someone else's fault
22/10/23, 4:59 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/--N3QB9qFx8?si=5LUAq9OCI8TIOMU2
@61452662705
22/10/23, 4:59 am - James: Chelskie messed that one up
22/10/23, 5:01 am - Gerrard: The keeper threw it away passing to Rice with 10 left
22/10/23, 5:01 am - Gerrard: 2-0 Arsenal weren't in it
22/10/23, 5:01 am - Gerrard: If Chelsea weren't a mess it easily could've been 3-0 or 4-0
22/10/23, 5:02 am - Gerrard: Threw it away like Liverpool did with Brighton last week
22/10/23, 5:02 am - Dave: What you been smoking 😂😂
22/10/23, 5:02 am - Dave: They were dog shit. Couldn’t hit a barn door
22/10/23, 5:02 am - Dave: A penalty and a cross
22/10/23, 5:02 am - Dave: Jackson the 🫏 can’t score to save his life
22/10/23, 5:03 am - Gerrard: They missed sitters and Arsenal giveaways after the 2nd, if they were better Arsenal go down 4-0
22/10/23, 5:03 am - Dave: We had a rough game and still pulled a point from the game
22/10/23, 5:03 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 did he watch the same game?
22/10/23, 5:04 am - James: Probably. But with ghastly US commentary
22/10/23, 5:04 am - James: May influence
22/10/23, 5:04 am - Gerrard: I was gonna say, why the fuck are there now females voices on the telly while I'm watching football games?
22/10/23, 5:05 am - Dave: “If Liverpool hadn’t screamed bloody murder after the spurs game, they would have lost today against Everton”
22/10/23, 5:05 am - Dave: “If Salah had a heart attack and died yesterday, liverpool would have lost today”
22/10/23, 5:05 am - Gerrard: @61422023136 like that cro bartender said women have no place in watching football
22/10/23, 5:05 am - Gerrard: Deflection instead of addressing the real issue @61452662705
22/10/23, 5:05 am - Dave: Someone photoshop gez head onto Michael owen
22/10/23, 5:06 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 peak analysis, did you say this?
22/10/23, 5:06 am - Dave: No issue, we’re unbeaten and second. We’re having a good season 🔴 ⚪️
22/10/23, 5:07 am - James: The road is long with many a winding turn
22/10/23, 5:08 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 🧐
22/10/23, 5:08 am - James: Drawsenal
22/10/23, 5:34 am - Dave: Losecastle 🤷🏼‍♂️
22/10/23, 5:34 am - James: You lost to a French team nobody has heard of
22/10/23, 5:35 am - James: And you were lucky last night. Very lucky
22/10/23, 5:35 am - James: Cracks beginning to show @61409710717?
22/10/23, 5:35 am - Gerrard: For who?
22/10/23, 5:36 am - Dave: @61409710717 doesn’t talk to mid clubs. Top 4 chat only
22/10/23, 5:36 am - James: Europa chat?
22/10/23, 5:37 am - Gerrard: If Liverpool sit in the top 4 position for the rest of the season, when is the cut off for calling them mid?
22/10/23, 5:39 am - Dave: Liverpool aren’t mid as long as they’re top 4. Anything outside 👋🏼
22/10/23, 5:40 am - Gerrard: So 5th isn't top 1/4, it's top 4 the 5th to 9th mid and then bottom half?
22/10/23, 5:40 am - Gerrard: *then 5th to 9th mid
22/10/23, 5:42 am - Gerrard: I need a list of English logic for the football and I'll adjust actual logic, so we're all on the same page
22/10/23, 5:42 am - Dave: Don’t know what it is officially but I’d class 5th to 10th as mid. 11th onwards bottom half
22/10/23, 5:43 am - Gerrard: What does this mean for Newy?
22/10/23, 5:43 am - James: What do we call a team that tops a CL group of death?
22/10/23, 5:43 am - Dave: To be fair though. Considering UCL is now top 5 maybe that fifth spot should be included now. UCL is the only reason there is a “top 4”
22/10/23, 5:44 am - James: And a team that (tops?) a farmers league competition table
22/10/23, 5:44 am - Gerrard: I thought what happens during the active season doesn't matter?
22/10/23, 5:44 am - Dave: PSG are farmers league kings in turmoil, settle down
22/10/23, 5:44 am - James: 'top 5'
22/10/23, 5:44 am - Gerrard: I thought we refer to teams on their previous year's position for the active season
22/10/23, 5:45 am - Gerrard: I'm so confused
22/10/23, 5:45 am - Dave: Seems fair right?
22/10/23, 5:45 am - James: You lost to lens
22/10/23, 5:45 am - James: Aren't they 11th or something
22/10/23, 5:45 am - Gerrard: I'm so confused
22/10/23, 5:45 am - Dave: Believe in the process
22/10/23, 5:45 am - Dave: All part of Arteta’s plan
22/10/23, 5:45 am - James: Talking about CL mate that's probably why
22/10/23, 5:45 am - Gerrard: I don't know what's a fact anymore
22/10/23, 5:46 am - James: Don't know much about LASK and union of Belgium of brussels
22/10/23, 5:46 am - Dave: Lol’d
22/10/23, 5:47 am - Gerrard: Feel like Frank Lampard would have a field day with Jimmy
22/10/23, 5:47 am - Gerrard: 1 champions league qualification and giving it the biggun
22/10/23, 5:48 am - James: 3 actually 😜
22/10/23, 5:48 am - James: Or 4
22/10/23, 5:49 am - Gerrard: Did Newy exist before 2021?
22/10/23, 5:49 am - James: So 6 to 10 is mid
22/10/23, 5:49 am - James: 6 is euro league
22/10/23, 5:49 am - James: Current season still in progress
22/10/23, 5:49 am - James: Varpool are mid? @14244893404
22/10/23, 5:50 am - Gerrard: I thought it was like Rangers disappearing and a new team being formed called the same name
22/10/23, 5:50 am - Gerrard: I'm so confused
22/10/23, 5:50 am - James: Did Varpool exist before the moore family got them out of division 2 by doing what citeh have done in recent years?
22/10/23, 5:50 am - Gerrard: Oooooo struck a nerve 🪇
22/10/23, 5:50 am - James: 70s to 80s especially
22/10/23, 5:51 am - James: Just chatting aren't we?
22/10/23, 5:51 am - Gerrard: You won today bro, be happy
22/10/23, 5:51 am - James: I had nothing to do with it too
22/10/23, 5:51 am - Gerrard: Still hating on the world
22/10/23, 5:51 am - James: Just an English boy watching in Australia
22/10/23, 5:52 am - Gerrard: Sorry, the Saudi team you support won bro, be happy
22/10/23, 5:52 am - Gerrard: Just be happy
22/10/23, 5:52 am - Gerrard: Stop typing
22/10/23, 5:52 am - James: And the anti human rights yank team you support scrapped past the mighty Everton. Big clap
22/10/23, 5:52 am - Gerrard: Be happy
22/10/23, 5:52 am - Gerrard: Another nerve struck 🪇
22/10/23, 5:52 am - Gerrard: I'm sorry bruv
22/10/23, 5:53 am - Gerrard: Didn't mean to take away your happiness today
22/10/23, 5:53 am - Gerrard: My bad
22/10/23, 5:54 am - Gerrard: 😘
22/10/23, 5:55 am - James: Ew
22/10/23, 6:58 am - Dave: 👍 Until this season is over and we know finishing positions
22/10/23, 7:41 am - Gerrard: Legit
22/10/23, 10:52 pm - Liam: Incredible goal, genius!
23/10/23, 2:22 am - Gerrard: Amazing that Mudryk looked good against Arsenal
23/10/23, 2:23 am - Louie: Still butt hurt that they wouldn’t 80mil for him
23/10/23, 2:23 am - Louie: 🤣
23/10/23, 2:24 am - Louie: pay*
23/10/23, 2:24 am - Gerrard: Karma
23/10/23, 2:34 am - Dave: That cross cost them 80m
23/10/23, 2:35 am - Dave: We got trossard instead
23/10/23, 2:35 am - Dave: No complaints whatsoever
23/10/23, 2:35 am - Gerrard: How much was Pepe?
23/10/23, 2:39 am - Dave: 75 I think. Why?
23/10/23, 2:40 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 😳
23/10/23, 2:44 am - James: Trossard 30?
23/10/23, 2:44 am - James: Mudeyk 22?
23/10/23, 2:44 am - James: How much was tossard?
23/10/23, 2:45 am - James: @61409710717?
23/10/23, 2:45 am - Gerrard: Too much
23/10/23, 2:45 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 how much was Havertz?
23/10/23, 2:45 am - James: A lot
23/10/23, 2:51 am - Pero: How much was poonez ?
23/10/23, 2:52 am - Gerrard: The guy banging in winners and assisting Salah, priceless
23/10/23, 2:53 am - Gerrard: I think if you looked across the 5 players mentioned above Nuney is the clear winner
23/10/23, 2:53 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 ?
23/10/23, 2:54 am - Pero: Pretty sure trossard is also a massive impact player banging in goals and assists
23/10/23, 2:55 am - Pero: Paid bugger all for him
23/10/23, 3:03 am - Pero: Assist was also with a shitbox 10man Everton for 60minutes who were all up the other end of the field
23/10/23, 3:04 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 did you see any of this?
23/10/23, 3:05 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Pero starting to sound like Rodders here
23/10/23, 3:08 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 all about impact I guess, I think Arteta doesn't use Tossard enough maybe or does need him 🤷🏼‍♂️
23/10/23, 3:09 am - Gerrard: *doesn't
23/10/23, 3:43 am - Dave: Nunez is a 100m donkey. Trossard is a 30m super sub that makes an impact every time he comes on 🤷🏼‍♂️
23/10/23, 3:51 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 think I've struck a nerve 🪇
23/10/23, 3:52 am - Gerrard: @61422023136 no PL assists? I like more well rounded player like Nunez
23/10/23, 3:55 am - Pero: He has only played 186 minutes so far, assists in PL are imminent
23/10/23, 4:28 am - Gerrard: Imma do that thing you Arsenal fans said about choosing Saka over Salah because he's younger by saying, you gotta take Nunez all day because Tossard is 28 bruv he's done bruv
23/10/23, 4:29 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 you think if Salah was playing in place of Saka then Arsenal would've won the league last year?
23/10/23, 4:47 am - Jono: Cbf reading all the above but sounds like Nuñez hate from people I thought had football intelligence
23/10/23, 4:48 am - Jono: Trossard’s a gun
Nuñez is a gun
23/10/23, 4:50 am - Gerrard: So close
23/10/23, 4:50 am - James: Wow
23/10/23, 4:50 am - Gerrard: He scores in big games 🤷🏼‍♂️
23/10/23, 4:50 am - James: Was Nunez £100m?
23/10/23, 4:50 am - Gerrard: Got more goals and assists
23/10/23, 4:50 am - Gerrard: Rodders inflation included
23/10/23, 4:51 am - James: @14244893404 @61422023136  would you take Isak over Trossard
23/10/23, 4:52 am - Gerrard: Ooooooo interesting
23/10/23, 4:52 am - James: @61409710717 would you take Isak over Nunez?
23/10/23, 4:53 am - Gerrard: Nah don't want anything with Newy taint on it
23/10/23, 4:53 am - James: @61404060785 same question
23/10/23, 4:53 am - Gerrard: Plus I don't want you to be upset by it
23/10/23, 4:53 am - Gerrard: ❤️
23/10/23, 4:53 am - Jono: I like Nuñez more personally
23/10/23, 4:54 am - Gerrard: Each man is entitled to his own opinion
23/10/23, 4:55 am - Jono: Quicker… more unpredictable. 
Just looks more dangerous and can play across the forward line than what I’ve seen of Isak so far
23/10/23, 4:56 am - Jono: Seems like Howe and Klopp conserving both players and easing them in over time
23/10/23, 4:59 am - Gerrard: Ease them in, just the tip baby
23/10/23, 4:59 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Callum Wilson keeping him out of the squad?
23/10/23, 5:10 am - James: Wilson has 23 goals in 30 games or something
23/10/23, 5:10 am - James: Isak 7 in 10
23/10/23, 5:10 am - James: I think Isak is a far better player than Nunez. But I respect your opinion
23/10/23, 5:15 am - Dave: That’s actually really difficult
23/10/23, 5:16 am - Dave: https://amp.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/13/benfica-confirm-100m-darwin-nunez-transfer-liverpool-bayern-sadio-mane
23/10/23, 5:17 am - Gerrard: Rodders have trouble with converting currency ❤️
23/10/23, 5:17 am - Gerrard: *has
23/10/23, 5:17 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Euro sounds better for his arguments
23/10/23, 5:17 am - James: Wow
23/10/23, 5:17 am - Gerrard: What about USD?
23/10/23, 5:17 am - Dave: @61452662705

I’d love isak in the Arsenal squad. I think he’s a better out and out striker than Jesus and Eddie by a country mile and we definitely need another striker
23/10/23, 5:18 am - Dave: But trossard has won us so many games recently, and is a true impact sub for us so I would hate to lose him
23/10/23, 5:18 am - Gerrard: Is there a suckup emoji?
23/10/23, 5:18 am - Dave: I’d swap Jesus and Eddie for Isak @61452662705
23/10/23, 5:18 am - Gerrard: Feel like this is a shot at Saka @61452662705
23/10/23, 5:19 am - Dave: How’s it a shot at saka? What has saka got to do with trossard?
23/10/23, 5:20 am - Gerrard: You mentioned winning games for Arsenal
23/10/23, 5:20 am - Dave: I’d take nunez over Eddie Nketiah @61409710717. If I’m going to have a donkey in the team, at least nunez is a rapid strong donkey <This message was edited>
23/10/23, 5:20 am - Gerrard: I didn't ask
23/10/23, 5:21 am - Dave: I think that was quite a flattering answer, thought you’d like that 🤷🏼‍♂️
23/10/23, 5:21 am - Liam: Ollie Watkins is better than isak
23/10/23, 5:22 am - Liam: I would take villa’s from three over newys
23/10/23, 5:22 am - Dave: Do you think Ivan toney is better thank isak @61478754484 ?
23/10/23, 5:22 am - Pero: That is difficult. Isak and trossard in combination would be lethal
23/10/23, 5:22 am - James: Wilson is better than Watkins
23/10/23, 5:22 am - Dave: Imagine
23/10/23, 5:23 am - Gerrard: Add Maddison in Pero
23/10/23, 5:23 am - Liam: 1000000000000000000%
23/10/23, 5:23 am - James: Saka doesn't show in big games
23/10/23, 5:23 am - Pero: Never
23/10/23, 5:23 am - James: Saka misses important pens
23/10/23, 5:24 am - James: Cost arsenal and england
23/10/23, 5:24 am - James: Saka shouldn't be in England squad ahead of Foden
23/10/23, 5:25 am - Gerrard: Well that's just facts innit
23/10/23, 5:25 am - James: Nobody thinks Saka is better than foden though do they?
23/10/23, 5:25 am - Liam: Different players
23/10/23, 5:26 am - Dave: Top 5 forwards in the prem..

1. Halaand
2. Watkins
3. Alvarez 
4. Wilson
5. Isak
23/10/23, 5:26 am - Gerrard: True, like Messi and Richard Dunne
23/10/23, 5:26 am - Dave: You get two mentions in there @61452662705 

Great time to be alive for Newcastle fans
23/10/23, 5:26 am - Dave: Totally different players. Saka is a better player than Foden. Way more clinical
23/10/23, 5:26 am - Gerrard: Need that suckup emoji @61452662705
23/10/23, 5:27 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 did you read that?
23/10/23, 5:27 am - Dave: They’re my top 5. No suckup 🤷🏼‍♂️
23/10/23, 5:27 am - Dave: If I was stirring I’d have arsenal forwards in. There wouldn’t I
23/10/23, 5:29 am - Gerrard: Needs to be near reality to get traction
23/10/23, 5:33 am - James: Agree with list. Not the order
23/10/23, 5:34 am - Dave: What order?
23/10/23, 5:34 am - James: Your order
23/10/23, 5:42 am - Gerrard: Chicken schnitzel and fries please
23/10/23, 5:47 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Arsenal fans now claiming they should've gotten a pen
23/10/23, 5:48 am - James: When
23/10/23, 5:54 am - Dave: Yeah I was asking you what your order is 🙄
23/10/23, 6:03 am - Gerrard: Chelsea game, they were gifted two goals and wanted a 3rd gift
23/10/23, 6:05 am - James: Woooow
23/10/23, 6:11 am - Gerrard: Didn't hear them crying for Wolves earlier in the season
23/10/23, 6:36 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 you think Arteta is "one" and done?
23/10/23, 6:37 am - James: One what?
23/10/23, 6:37 am - James: Season?
23/10/23, 6:37 am - James: One top four finish?
23/10/23, 6:37 am - Gerrard: Can't say win but kinda good season?
23/10/23, 6:43 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Arteta is copying Pep's bad traits too, overthinking and choppin changin the squad each week
23/10/23, 6:44 am - Gerrard: I'm not feeling the same enthusiasm from the Arsenal fans in this group chat this season, feels tense
23/10/23, 6:44 am - Gerrard: Or worried
23/10/23, 6:44 am - Dave: Last I checked, arteta beat pep the last two times he played him. How did klippety get on?
23/10/23, 6:44 am - Gerrard: Concerned
23/10/23, 6:45 am - James: Liam is quieter
23/10/23, 6:46 am - Dave: Hey @61452662705, did howe beat pep last game you played as well?
23/10/23, 6:48 am - Gerrard: Lol yeah last two games reference looks sick bro
23/10/23, 6:49 am - Dave: Classic liverpool fan living in the past
23/10/23, 6:49 am - Gerrard: I'm shocked too bro
23/10/23, 6:49 am - Dave: Start bringing up those trophies from the 70s again @61409710717 to prove your point
23/10/23, 6:50 am - Gerrard: 2 games ago vs 50yrs ago, @61452662705 can we not find the middle ground here?
23/10/23, 6:58 am - Gerrard: Hard to understand what's going on
23/10/23, 7:02 am - James: A lot of venom today
23/10/23, 7:03 am - James: All angles
23/10/23, 7:04 am - Gerrard: I just thought knocking City out of the Champions League 5-1 was of a higher value than beating them to the community shield on penalties 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️
23/10/23, 7:05 am - James: Community Shield means nothing
23/10/23, 7:05 am - Gerrard: Well I don't know what to think them
23/10/23, 7:05 am - Gerrard: *then
23/10/23, 7:05 am - James: Shouldn't count on any trophy list tbf
23/10/23, 7:06 am - James: Especially if you only played in it by default
23/10/23, 7:06 am - James: Because the other team won everything else
23/10/23, 7:06 am - James: 'Charity Shield'
23/10/23, 7:06 am - Gerrard: Yeah should they have a separate rating if you didn't win the fa cup vs bottling to 2nd?
23/10/23, 7:06 am - James: That was its old name?
23/10/23, 7:07 am - Gerrard: *did win
23/10/23, 7:07 am - Gerrard: I'm so confused
23/10/23, 7:07 am - Gerrard: Do you get a medal for moving from 5th to 2nd in a season?
23/10/23, 7:08 am - Gerrard: Livo might get that this year then
23/10/23, 7:14 am - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣@61452662705 he's still bringing this screenshot up 🤣🤣🤣
23/10/23, 7:16 am - Gerrard: But Newy BEAT City, Arsenal DREW.
@61452662705 am I correct?
23/10/23, 7:17 am - Dave: We beat them 4-1 😎
23/10/23, 7:18 am - Liam: 4-1 ✅
23/10/23, 7:18 am - Dave: Did arsenal put 4 goals in back of the net?
23/10/23, 7:22 am - Jono: This chat is really suffering from the excessive heat today
23/10/23, 7:50 am - Pero: Even Rory a beloved chelsea fan admitted during the chelsea v arsenal game that arsenal will win the league given that comeback. Just saying
23/10/23, 8:30 am - James: Where's our line up?
23/10/23, 8:31 am - James: I count five starters there
23/10/23, 8:32 am - James: He said Haaland was crap too last season 😲
23/10/23, 8:37 am - Dave: Classic Howe playbook at it again. Aggressive pressing for first 10 games of season, save those points up. Then park the bus the following 15 games to avoid injuries and fatigue. Drawcastle incoming 🤙
23/10/23, 8:37 am - James: Joint best defence too atm?
23/10/23, 8:38 am - James: Third least conceded, joint clean sheets with 4?
23/10/23, 8:40 am - James: We had less points after ten games last season than we do after 9 this season with two additional CL games to boot. What are you talking about mate?
23/10/23, 9:09 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Pero believing Rory's clickbait headlines, paying his mortgage
23/10/23, 9:10 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 😂 they had to rope in Rice for the picture because they don't have more than 2 decent defenders
23/10/23, 9:11 am - Gerrard: Does Newy have a try hard photo of three players to go along with these stats also?
23/10/23, 9:15 am - James: Confusing day. Must be a combination of the heat and big weekends @61409710717?
23/10/23, 9:19 am - James: Nunez beats Isak for red cards
23/10/23, 9:20 am - Gerrard: Not a bad comparison
23/10/23, 9:21 am - Gerrard: I think Rodders been heavily drinking again and Pero's still jetlagged
23/10/23, 9:23 am - James: Must be having a day off tomorrow
23/10/23, 9:23 am - James: Rodwell that is
23/10/23, 9:24 am - James: @61409710717 has all of Nunez assists been Salah?
23/10/23, 9:24 am - James: For Salah
23/10/23, 9:27 am - Gerrard: Yeah bloody favouritism, such a Rodder (a suckup)
23/10/23, 9:27 am - Dave: So nunez > isak?
23/10/23, 9:27 am - Gerrard: Here comes Mr drinkie
23/10/23, 9:28 am - Gerrard: Just woke up in a puddle of his own piss
23/10/23, 9:28 am - Dave: Mr drinkie?
23/10/23, 9:28 am - James: Wow
23/10/23, 9:29 am - Gerrard: It's how you get the alcohol in, unless you're shelving it with tampons
23/10/23, 9:29 am - James: Jesus
23/10/23, 9:29 am - Gerrard: I know, he needs help
23/10/23, 9:29 am - James: You said it man
23/10/23, 9:30 am - Gerrard: The first step is acknowledgement
23/10/23, 9:30 am - Gerrard: Rodders?
23/10/23, 9:30 am - Dave: Whats going on. You tripping on the psychedelics again jez, or just getting rejected by men. Why all the anger
23/10/23, 9:30 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 wow
23/10/23, 9:31 am - Gerrard: I'm no longer confused, I'm concerned
23/10/23, 8:16 pm - Dave: https://metro.co.uk/2023/10/23/howard-webb-comments-highlight-arsenal-decision-error-during-chelsea-draw-19704584/amp/
23/10/23, 11:31 pm - James: Haven't played anyone yet
23/10/23, 11:32 pm - Jono: I was just looking at their draw 

At one stage late next season around late April /early May they have Man U, Man C, Arsenal and LFC back to back
23/10/23, 11:33 pm - Dave: You mean they haven’t played city yet…
23/10/23, 11:33 pm - Dave: They drew with us, beat liverpool and beat United
23/10/23, 11:34 pm - James: You're not in form and Varpool had 9 men
23/10/23, 11:34 pm - Dave: They’re doing well. I’m still convinced wheels will fall off sooner rather than later
23/10/23, 11:34 pm - Dave: But gets worrying as games rack up
23/10/23, 11:34 pm - James: Manure are shit away from home to teams who finished top 10
23/10/23, 11:34 pm - Dave: True
23/10/23, 11:34 pm - James: Haven't won a game
23/10/23, 11:35 pm - Dave: Can’t get over how bad odegaard is playing this season. Totally off the boil
23/10/23, 11:35 pm - James: Spurs are only three points better off than they were same stage last season
23/10/23, 11:35 pm - Dave: Wonder whether xhaka leaving or his new contract has something to do with it
23/10/23, 11:35 pm - James: Flying under conte initially
23/10/23, 11:36 pm - Dave: Yeah
23/10/23, 11:36 pm - Dave: Let’s see what happens when levy has an inevitable bust up with Ange
23/10/23, 11:36 pm - Dave: Only a matter of time
23/10/23, 11:36 pm - James: Or son gets injured
23/10/23, 11:36 pm - James: Or maddison
23/10/23, 11:37 pm - James: Who else they got
23/10/23, 11:37 pm - James: No bench
23/10/23, 11:37 pm - Jono: They brought on some rough players late today
23/10/23, 11:38 pm - Jono: I don’t rate Johnson
23/10/23, 11:38 pm - Jono: But their backline is very good
23/10/23, 11:38 pm - Dave: That cb they signed is the bollocks
23/10/23, 11:38 pm - Dave: And vicario is decent
23/10/23, 11:38 pm - Jono: And enough to think they’ll be able to be up there come season end
23/10/23, 11:38 pm - Jono: Especially without Europe
24/10/23, 12:59 am - Gerrard: Apart from the refs gifting them the result against Liverpool they've not played one decent team.
24/10/23, 12:59 am - Gerrard: Suckup Rodders at it again
24/10/23, 1:00 am - Dave: Sucking up to who? All the spurs fans in here
24/10/23, 1:14 am - Jono: Such a clean cut
24/10/23, 1:15 am - Jono: ✂️
24/10/23, 2:02 am - Gerrard: It's embarrassing
24/10/23, 2:03 am - Gerrard: Derrick at it again?
24/10/23, 2:05 am - James: It's like Varpool fans loving on Everton
24/10/23, 2:05 am - Jono: 10 month ban for Tonali
24/10/23, 2:06 am - Gerrard: Worse because there's less of a competitive edge
24/10/23, 2:09 am - James: Neves for free in Jan and Tonali back for the start of next season. Perfec 👌
24/10/23, 2:10 am - James: Wow
24/10/23, 2:45 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/7qRacpLXZN8?si=CqYjl2--qd1seOAb
@61452662705 your mate
24/10/23, 4:22 am - Pero: Christ
24/10/23, 4:31 am - Gerrard: Dumb fuck doesn't know how to eat a pizza properly
24/10/23, 4:33 am - Pero: Didn't realise there was a pizza
24/10/23, 4:47 am - Dave: Nonce
24/10/23, 7:39 am - James: Who'd have thunk it

24/10/23, 12:52 pm - Gerrard: Just watching it
24/10/23, 12:52 pm - Gerrard: Also heard Tonali is a groomer
24/10/23, 3:33 pm - Dave: Does this mean he’s not “signing of the year” anymore?
24/10/23, 3:50 pm - Gerrard: That'll fuck up his multi
24/10/23, 9:30 pm - James: Some of these names in the sevilla side must be at least 40 now
24/10/23, 9:51 pm - Dave: Rakatic and Ramos got to be close
24/10/23, 9:52 pm - Dave: Great assist from Jesus, class
24/10/23, 11:37 pm - James: Thought that was Raya
25/10/23, 12:24 am - Liam: That was a classy performance
25/10/23, 12:47 am - James: @61409710717?
25/10/23, 12:47 am - Gerrard: Rapey?
25/10/23, 12:48 am - James: Arsenal wouldn't stand by a rapist
25/10/23, 2:06 am - Gerrard: They stood by a pedo
25/10/23, 2:36 am - Pero: Who was the pedo ?
25/10/23, 3:44 am - Dave: Didn’t know we had a pedo in squad 🤷🏼‍♂️
25/10/23, 3:44 am - Gerrard: Wenger
25/10/23, 3:44 am - Gerrard: I thought that was common knowledge like Savills
25/10/23, 9:17 am - Gerrard: How on brand is it that Arsenal win in Europe and all the headlines are about United
25/10/23, 9:18 am - Gerrard: No Ramsdale and no command of their area inside the box on set pieces
25/10/23, 9:19 am - Gerrard: Incredibly lucky at the end there
25/10/23, 9:19 am - Gerrard: Looks like Raya is the new Onana
25/10/23, 9:31 am - Dave: Who have you got tomorrow night @61409710717?
25/10/23, 9:32 am - Gerrard: So is that a no comment?
25/10/23, 9:32 am - James: Shiiit
25/10/23, 9:32 am - James: Raya get lobbed again?
25/10/23, 9:32 am - Gerrard: Watch the highlights
25/10/23, 9:32 am - James: What happened?
25/10/23, 9:32 am - James: Can't bring myself to mate
25/10/23, 9:33 am - James: Sevilla retirement home losing to arsenals strongest 11
25/10/23, 9:33 am - Gerrard: Almost palmed a cross on the edge of the 6 yard into his own goal
25/10/23, 9:33 am - Gerrard: Not the same since Emery left
25/10/23, 9:33 am - Gerrard: Play like a Europa league team like Toulouse
25/10/23, 9:34 am - Dave: I’m going to have to get the arsenal in your head meme badge out again, you talk about us more than liverpool
25/10/23, 9:34 am - Dave: Oooo I’ve actually heard of that city. Tough fixture for you
25/10/23, 9:35 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I watch the day's highlights and Arsenal are embarrassing, and I'm supposed to talk a out Liverpool????
I'm so confused
25/10/23, 9:35 am - Gerrard: *about
25/10/23, 9:36 am - James: I'll check later after dinner
25/10/23, 9:36 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 if Livo lose on Friday, does that make Arsenal less rubbish?
25/10/23, 9:36 am - James: Or should I watch before dinner?
25/10/23, 9:36 am - James: How bad was it!?
25/10/23, 9:36 am - Dave: Not sure what’s embarrassing. Picked up 3 points
25/10/23, 9:37 am - Dave: Do 3 points only count now if you convincingly win them? You’d be bottom 3 if that were the case
25/10/23, 9:37 am - Gerrard: It's just I expect the best team in England to properly do the 8th best team in Spain
25/10/23, 9:37 am - Gerrard: Arsenal won the league last year right?
25/10/23, 9:37 am - Dave: We’re not the best team in England
25/10/23, 9:37 am - Dave: Strange comment
25/10/23, 9:38 am - Gerrard: I can't remember the end of the season, there was all this talk about then winning the league and they were ahead by a mile
@61452662705
25/10/23, 9:39 am - Gerrard: Ah shit, I just checked an end of season vid about Arsenal
25/10/23, 9:39 am - Gerrard: Sorry
25/10/23, 9:39 am - Dave: You can’t remember it because you went AWOL. You only unmuted the football chats at the start of this season when you picked up a few points and wanted to pipe up
25/10/23, 9:39 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/Eokx-WN-KrM?si=yqM1Jg_nRdyUIdFI
25/10/23, 9:40 am - Gerrard: Sorry that's the wrong year
25/10/23, 9:40 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/kF-gQBCpUbg?si=F1WjfCCb7ChjaCm3
25/10/23, 9:40 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I completely forgot about Saka at West Ham
25/10/23, 9:40 am - Dave: Racist
25/10/23, 9:41 am - Dave: Predictions for dortmund @61452662705
25/10/23, 9:42 am - Dave: You’re at home, should be a SJP under the lights dicking?
25/10/23, 9:42 am - Gerrard: Predictions for Arsenal's season @61452662705 ?
25/10/23, 9:42 am - James: .Exe will I get a virus if I open that @61409710717?
25/10/23, 9:43 am - James: Tough match. Good team.
25/10/23, 9:44 am - Gerrard: It's just a name, not gonna get infected with Bottleitis
25/10/23, 9:44 am - James: I meant us
25/10/23, 9:45 am - James: Going for a Desmond
25/10/23, 9:57 am - James: @14244893404 what's your thoughts
25/10/23, 9:58 am - Gerrard: (counting down to suckup)
25/10/23, 10:07 am - Dave: I think you’ll dick them, Newcastle are on fire right now
25/10/23, 12:56 pm - Liam: 150m
25/10/23, 1:20 pm - Gerrard: Don't worry, Longstaff innit
25/10/23, 1:53 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/BvDfFjJQziU?si=IPgww7tZspJfVZ2a
25/10/23, 5:50 pm - Dave: That’s insane, whole organisation is rotten from top down
25/10/23, 5:51 pm - Dave: Still can’t get over kovavic against us. City are clearly putting money in the right pockets
25/10/23, 9:59 pm - Jono: Isak’s pulled a hammy
25/10/23, 10:01 pm - Jono: No good 

Might need to borrow Benzema from their league
25/10/23, 10:07 pm - Jono: Dortmunds manager looks like an emo gamer
25/10/23, 10:07 pm - James: Yeah we could do that tbf
25/10/23, 10:08 pm - James: Players who pull up ten mins into a game is fucked
25/10/23, 10:14 pm - Dave: You think you’re missing Tonali @61452662705 ?
25/10/23, 10:18 pm - Jono: Their keeper is having a blinder
25/10/23, 10:24 pm - James: Think Joelinton isn't fit
25/10/23, 10:24 pm - James: Tonali coming on now
25/10/23, 10:25 pm - Jono: You know you’re desperate when you’ve gotta put the gamblor on
25/10/23, 10:25 pm - Dave: 🤞 he hasn’t got a “Newcastle red card and dortmund to win acca”
25/10/23, 10:26 pm - Liam: Last your see him this season
25/10/23, 10:26 pm - James: Nothing wrong with standing by a gambler
25/10/23, 10:26 pm - James: Standing by a racist however...
25/10/23, 10:26 pm - James: Or rapist...
25/10/23, 10:27 pm - James: A racist biter...
25/10/23, 10:27 pm - Dave: Alleged
25/10/23, 10:27 pm - Liam: I got no problem with gamblers lol
25/10/23, 10:28 pm - Liam: Just found it funny you sunk 50m on him
25/10/23, 10:28 pm - James: Money is no issue
25/10/23, 10:28 pm - Dave: Right. I was just saying that to another mate of mine, it’s a joke he gets a ban. Should have just got a big fine and get on with it
25/10/23, 10:28 pm - James: What's it to do with Newcastle
25/10/23, 10:28 pm - Liam: I love a gambler
25/10/23, 10:28 pm - Liam: Bull run
25/10/23, 10:29 pm - James: All I care about again
25/10/23, 10:29 pm - Liam: Rapists don’t seem too bad to be honest
25/10/23, 10:29 pm - Dave: Nothing to do with Newcastle or prem. I can understand bans for doping, give them a chance to get it out their system. But gambling?! Give it a rest. Give him a fuck off fine, like a years salary or something, and get on with it
25/10/23, 10:30 pm - James: Agree
25/10/23, 10:31 pm - Jono: Another injury
25/10/23, 10:31 pm - Jono: Fuck
25/10/23, 10:31 pm - Jono: Murphy 

Who we got from Saudi league @61452662705 ?
25/10/23, 10:31 pm - Dave: Digging deep now @61452662705, bringing on the brucey barmy army
25/10/23, 10:32 pm - James: Depth
25/10/23, 10:37 pm - Dave: Trippier is so good, think he’s Newcastles best player
25/10/23, 10:45 pm - Dave: Newcastle getting robbed by this ref, woeful
25/10/23, 10:57 pm - Jono: How? All I saw was Gordon rolling around and getting free kicks on every occasion
25/10/23, 10:59 pm - Dave: You see Wilson get dragged to floor by his shorts and ref gave no free kick? Blatant and right in front of him
25/10/23, 10:59 pm - Dave: And why are UEFA not taking goal difference into consideration?
25/10/23, 10:59 pm - Jono: They weren’t robbed just because of that come on
25/10/23, 11:00 pm - James: Saw that. Shit ref. Hit the bar twice. Gordon unlucky
25/10/23, 11:00 pm - Jono: It’s based on H2H. Been that way for a while now
25/10/23, 11:00 pm - Dave: I know, just don’t agree with it
25/10/23, 11:03 pm - James: Group of death ☠️
25/10/23, 11:08 pm - Jono: It’s only unfair until your own team is on the right end of it I suppose
25/10/23, 11:12 pm - Liam: Who do you think you will get in Europa?
25/10/23, 11:13 pm - James: Rather finish bottom than play in that embarrassing competition
25/10/23, 11:13 pm - James: Who you playing tomorrow @61404060785?
25/10/23, 11:13 pm - Gerrard: A lot of messages, did Arsenal lose?
25/10/23, 11:13 pm - Liam: Newy
25/10/23, 11:14 pm - Jono: Toulouse - looking forward to it
25/10/23, 11:14 pm - James: Is it too early to bottle yet?
25/10/23, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: Hey the CL is hard
25/10/23, 11:14 pm - James: At least someone is
25/10/23, 11:15 pm - James: @61409710717 I didn't watch the highlights last night
25/10/23, 11:15 pm - Jono: Europa would’ve turned into a mini PL come Feb if Onana hadn’t saved that pen
25/10/23, 11:16 pm - Gerrard: I'll just say I'm more impressed by Newy losing 1-0 to Dortmund than I am about Arsenal winning 2-1 to Sevilla.
25/10/23, 11:16 pm - James: Where the hell are young boys from <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 11:17 pm - James: Some name
25/10/23, 11:18 pm - Jono: Dan Burn injured too
25/10/23, 11:18 pm - Jono: Yikes
25/10/23, 11:19 pm - Gerrard: Pep coming from behind to smash young boys?
25/10/23, 11:19 pm - Liam: Oh this is a new approach
25/10/23, 11:20 pm - Gerrard: I have no beef with you good Sir
25/10/23, 11:24 pm - Jono: https://x.com/chloereilly21/status/1717253967673958435?s=48
26/10/23, 12:03 am - Dave: Very. I actually felt some respect brewing for liverpool watching the Sevilla game
26/10/23, 12:04 am - Dave: Must be so overwhelming for the players. Crowd is so loud compared to prem and have to adapt to different styles of football. Tough comp
26/10/23, 12:29 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 do you understand wtf this guy is talking about?
26/10/23, 12:30 am - James: Him and your mate spouting waffle this morning @61409710717
26/10/23, 12:30 am - James: Must be the weather
26/10/23, 12:31 am - Dave: So much anger. Just gave liverpool a compliment 🤷🏼‍♂️
26/10/23, 12:32 am - James: Would you rather arsenal go into Europa if they don't get out the group or finish bottom
26/10/23, 12:42 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 NOT a suckup, yeah
26/10/23, 12:51 am - Gerrard: Europa debate in this too

https://youtu.be/mUe08-6LgL4?si=6Hx6lG6fNx0SkzPv
26/10/23, 12:59 am - Dave: Oh Europa of course, there’s no difference between Europa or UCL anyway
26/10/23, 1:04 am - Gerrard: This
26/10/23, 2:37 am - Gerrard: Suckup again
26/10/23, 2:37 am - Gerrard: Quoting the Sun now
26/10/23, 3:01 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/wqYF4Mqn_60?si=1iD13kBDbLZT5QJP
I like watching the Newy fan's takes too much
26/10/23, 3:18 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 you think Newy would sure Milan about Tonali?
26/10/23, 4:24 am - James: If they can prove they knew
26/10/23, 4:24 am - James: Man City were about to sign Paqueta and they pulled out
26/10/23, 4:25 am - Gerrard: I know you love them overall but verdict on Gordon and Wilson for just today's game?
26/10/23, 4:25 am - James: Gotta look at the Italian FA too. If they were investigating Tonali prior to us signing him
26/10/23, 4:25 am - Gerrard: And do you think Howe's integrity is in question as he continues to play Tonali?
26/10/23, 4:26 am - Gerrard: AC Milan IS Italian FA, all in bed
26/10/23, 4:26 am - James: For what?
26/10/23, 4:26 am - Gerrard: Playing Tonali
26/10/23, 4:26 am - James: Gordon was good. Wilson was quiet. Game was for Isak but he went off after ten
26/10/23, 4:27 am - James: Why can't he play him
26/10/23, 4:27 am - Gerrard: Gordon caused the goal?
26/10/23, 4:27 am - Gerrard: Wilson missed the sitter?
26/10/23, 4:27 am - James: Trippier bombed forward and left space down the right
26/10/23, 4:28 am - Gerrard: Normally you'd sideline someone under a massive investigation of illegal activities, distracting the team and just a bad look?
26/10/23, 4:28 am - James: Wilson scores shit loads of goals. Without him we'd have been back in the championship during the Bruce years
26/10/23, 4:28 am - Gerrard: Just talking about this game remember
26/10/23, 4:28 am - Gerrard: No prior love
26/10/23, 4:28 am - James: We don't do that. Stand by him and support him
26/10/23, 4:29 am - James: I thought Joelinton was awful because he wasn't fit.
26/10/23, 4:29 am - Gerrard: Like Suarez?
26/10/23, 4:30 am - James: Big difference. Suarez is a racist headcase who bites adult men on the football pitch
26/10/23, 4:30 am - Gerrard: Lol
26/10/23, 4:30 am - James: You don't like Suarez surely?
26/10/23, 4:30 am - James: @61409710717 if Suarez was Australian would you stand by him
26/10/23, 4:30 am - Gerrard: Not after he celebrated his goals against Livo
26/10/23, 4:31 am - Gerrard: Not if he celebrated his goals against Livo
26/10/23, 4:31 am - Gerrard: As with my attitude to Ange, don't give a fuck if you're Aussie
26/10/23, 4:32 am - Gerrard: Never like Tim Cahill either
26/10/23, 4:32 am - Gerrard: *liked
26/10/23, 4:32 am - Gerrard: Broke Xabi Alonso's leg
26/10/23, 4:32 am - James: Rolf Harris?
26/10/23, 4:32 am - Gerrard: Jimmy Savile?
26/10/23, 4:32 am - Gerrard: Prince Andrew?
26/10/23, 4:32 am - James: No he's from yorkshire
26/10/23, 4:45 am - James: https://x.com/BVB/status/1717298019207434332?s=08
26/10/23, 4:51 am - Gerrard: For the 3pts?
26/10/23, 6:06 am - James: Rooney looks well for a 38 year old

26/10/23, 8:14 am - James: Interesting kind of party

26/10/23, 8:15 am - James: Shitting in mouths these days
26/10/23, 8:54 am - Jono: https://x.com/stehoare/status/1717267668770709746?s=48

26/10/23, 11:23 am - James: Wasn't hazard more intense
26/10/23, 11:23 am - James: As in, it was two seasons where he did most of the goals and assists
26/10/23, 11:24 am - Gerrard: Not sure but that says same amount of games
26/10/23, 11:25 am - James: Thought he was crap first few seasons. He was great in France prior to chelsea
26/10/23, 11:25 am - Gerrard: Is it the Oddergard effect?
Being good in a shite team makes you look elite?
26/10/23, 11:26 am - Gerrard: Also known as the Saliba Paradox
26/10/23, 11:27 am - James: He scored 7 goals in 76 games at Madrid lol

26/10/23, 11:19 pm - Gerrard: So silky smooth all the way up to hitting the post
26/10/23, 11:32 pm - Jono: He had his Torres moment
27/10/23, 1:31 am - James: Is his transfer fee alone worth more than that entire toulouse team?
27/10/23, 1:31 am - Gerrard: Without scoring?
27/10/23, 1:32 am - Gerrard: Aw yeah 💦💦💦
27/10/23, 1:33 am - James: Reminds me of when homer entered a contest meant for children and won

27/10/23, 1:40 am - Gerrard: Sound
27/10/23, 1:41 am - Gerrard: So you're saying Nunez is so far ahead of everyone else on the field, noice
27/10/23, 1:41 am - Jono: Didn’t Torres miss a similar one
27/10/23, 1:42 am - Jono: For Chelsea from memory
27/10/23, 1:42 am - Gerrard: Don't watch Chelsea games mate
27/10/23, 1:42 am - James: If you put an adult man on the same field as a bunch of 8 year olds
27/10/23, 1:42 am - James: Better at football
27/10/23, 1:43 am - James: But I'd say the 8 year olds probably have more intelligence
27/10/23, 1:43 am - Gerrard: Did Toulouse field eight year olds today?
27/10/23, 1:43 am - Gerrard: I'm so confused
27/10/23, 1:43 am - James: No idea I never heard of them
27/10/23, 1:43 am - Gerrard: But you watched the game?
27/10/23, 1:44 am - Jono: Thankfully his lack of intelligence is still allowing him to earn more than you and me will earn in a lifetime 🙏
27/10/23, 1:44 am - James: I don't watch Europa mate sorry
27/10/23, 1:44 am - Gerrard: Then why you talking?
27/10/23, 1:44 am - Gerrard: I'm so confused

27/10/23, 1:49 am - Jono: As he was ballin at one point
27/10/23, 1:49 am - Gerrard: Also over Barnes Liverguy and Flash in the pan Gordon.
27/10/23, 1:50 am - James: Yeah but doesn't change the fact he is a thick ugly looking Mexican cunt
27/10/23, 1:51 am - James: Free Tonali
27/10/23, 1:51 am - Gerrard: Wow with the English racism
27/10/23, 1:51 am - James: How is that racist
27/10/23, 1:51 am - James: Just chatting aren't we?
27/10/23, 1:53 am - Gerrard: Mexico and Uruguay are two very different places in the world

27/10/23, 2:40 am - Gerrard: Wtf?
27/10/23, 2:48 am - Jono: Some strong 2018 World Cup final anger scent coming thru
27/10/23, 2:49 am - Pero: Poonez said I can do better then the frenchies shitting in each other's mouths, I'll miss an open goal
27/10/23, 2:55 am - Gerrard: I'm so confused
27/10/23, 8:11 am - Dave: Endo or Slob?
27/10/23, 8:15 am - James: Don't know but they made it about man utd somehow
27/10/23, 8:59 am - Gerrard: Endo scored a header cunt
27/10/23, 9:00 am - Gerrard: I'd take any chance to stick it United, wouldn't you?
27/10/23, 9:02 am - James: Fuck em
27/10/23, 9:02 am - James: Let them gamble
27/10/23, 9:02 am - Gerrard: Exactly

27/10/23, 9:02 am - James: Let ufc fighters and boxers take steroids
27/10/23, 9:03 am - James: Make F1 drivers take off their helmets
27/10/23, 9:03 am - Gerrard: Looking good
27/10/23, 9:03 am - Gerrard: Big lanky Dutchman
27/10/23, 9:03 am - Dave: Good buy at that price. Liverpool did some good business this transfer window it seems

27/10/23, 9:06 am - Gerrard: Arsenal fans have goldfish memories and no backbones
27/10/23, 9:07 am - Dave: Stan’s the man
27/10/23, 9:09 am - Gerrard: I'm sick of Dave Pero Anth and Liam pretending like AFTV are some minority of fans and don't represent what Arsenal fans are.
27/10/23, 9:09 am - Gerrard: They are all exactly that.
27/10/23, 9:09 am - James: Bunch of Robbie's?
27/10/23, 9:09 am - James: Tys?

27/10/23, 10:00 am - Liam: They represent me
27/10/23, 10:02 am - Liam: Na they won’t turn on him, Havertz maybe.
27/10/23, 10:03 am - Gerrard: Evidence suggests otherwise
27/10/23, 10:20 am - Pero: We trust in the process
27/10/23, 10:22 am - Gerrard: Of not winning anything?
27/10/23, 10:57 am - Liam: Why so much hate?

27/10/23, 1:12 pm - Gerrard: See the difference is they actually have evidence on Tonali.....🤷🏼‍♂️
27/10/23, 1:15 pm - James: Saying Evra is a liar? <This message was edited>

28/10/23, 1:19 am - Gerrard: Must be an American reference
28/10/23, 1:20 am - Gerrard: Another bad look for Newy
28/10/23, 1:25 am - Pero: Tottenham had 1 shot on target this morning
28/10/23, 1:27 am - James: I had them to win and over 2.5 goals. Maddison fucked it by doing nothing though. No goal or assist
28/10/23, 1:29 am - James: You played a racist biter
28/10/23, 1:29 am - James: Sunderland played a peodophile
28/10/23, 1:30 am - James: Manure have a woman beater. Two woman beaters
28/10/23, 1:30 am - James: Arsenal a rapist
28/10/23, 1:30 am - Gerrard: You keep saying this, so does this absolve Newy of bad deeds?
28/10/23, 1:30 am - James: What they done wrong?
28/10/23, 1:31 am - Gerrard: What does any of that have to do with Newy showing no class?
28/10/23, 1:31 am - James: Your entire squad is a bunch of fake asthmatics
28/10/23, 1:31 am - Gerrard: Two wrongs don't make a right
28/10/23, 1:31 am - Gerrard: Again, what's this to do with Newy?
28/10/23, 1:31 am - James: He's not banned?
28/10/23, 1:32 am - James: Has he been banned?
28/10/23, 1:32 am - Gerrard: Wow
28/10/23, 1:49 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CyIgMFWAwpl/?igshid=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==

28/10/23, 2:26 am - James: Were you on the phone to Fifa?

29/10/23, 2:05 am - Pero: https://youtu.be/Fuyof9anNyw?si=_4Gympb_hPiPU3J5

Another VAR doozy
29/10/23, 2:05 am - James: The last goal 😂
29/10/23, 2:05 am - James: Read somewhere Brentford have won more times at Stamford Bridge this year than Chelsea have
29/10/23, 2:06 am - James: 100% a pen
29/10/23, 2:06 am - Pero: Oftt you got away with one there @61452662705
29/10/23, 2:07 am - Gerrard: It's Sheffield guys c'mon
29/10/23, 2:07 am - James: Na never looked like losing. Shit game. Really flat. We always draw with wolves
29/10/23, 2:07 am - James: Did you see Vieras penalty?
29/10/23, 2:08 am - James: Less than convincing @61409710717
29/10/23, 2:08 am - Gerrard: Don't watch the highlights if your teams don't lose
29/10/23, 2:09 am - James: We beat them 8-0 away and Arsenal fans saying they're going to win the league after last night
29/10/23, 2:09 am - James: Ditto
29/10/23, 2:09 am - Pero: Gerry the Sunday morning vampire searching for blood
29/10/23, 2:09 am - Gerrard: Missed the morning, just woke up
29/10/23, 2:10 am - James: Sucking the fun out of a 5-0 win 🦇
29/10/23, 2:11 am - Pero: 🦇 🧛‍♂️
29/10/23, 2:18 am - Dave: We’re unbeaten this season and you just drew to wolves, get back in your box
29/10/23, 2:19 am - Gerrard: They only won 5-0 against the worse team in the league?
29/10/23, 2:19 am - Gerrard: Wow, won 5-0 and spending his energy trying to shoot you down. Shame.
29/10/23, 2:20 am - James: Yeah 😂
29/10/23, 2:20 am - Gerrard: Some people just can't be happy, always looking over the fence at the neighbours yard
29/10/23, 2:20 am - James: Weird. Wolves just beat Citeh at home and drew with Villa. Undefeated in five. Decent point at theirs I'd say <This message was edited>
29/10/23, 2:20 am - James: Tall poppies
29/10/23, 2:21 am - Gerrard: I don't think Arteta lasts after this season
29/10/23, 2:22 am - James: How can he when Ange wins spurs the premier league in his first season
29/10/23, 2:22 am - James: 'but we have inverted full backs though'
29/10/23, 2:23 am - Pero: Yeh I think Barca are after him
29/10/23, 2:23 am - Gerrard: Does Zinnychenko even play anymore?
29/10/23, 2:23 am - Gerrard: Are they desperate?
29/10/23, 2:24 am - Pero: Nah just wanna win el classico and la liga
29/10/23, 2:25 am - Gerrard: Then why sign a real manager, instead of a Pep copier with only 1 previous job?
29/10/23, 2:25 am - Dave: I’ve heard Madrid want him as well @61422023136 Tough gig when you’ve got the most wanted young manager in the world 😭
29/10/23, 2:25 am - Gerrard: *why not
29/10/23, 2:25 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
29/10/23, 2:26 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 read that on the Arsenal forums
29/10/23, 2:26 am - Pero: Yeh its not easy when everyone else wants to learn the process
29/10/23, 2:27 am - Pero: Xavi ?
29/10/23, 2:28 am - Gerrard: Has he been less successful than Arteta?
Pretty sure Arteta has done nothing.
29/10/23, 2:28 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 can you confirm?
29/10/23, 2:30 am - Pero: https://youtu.be/d0u2vXI__Zg?si=FRir_3eIOcVuF80j

Barca need the light bulb and power chord
29/10/23, 2:34 am - Gerrard: Maybe should've stayed at City then
29/10/23, 2:34 am - Gerrard: I'm still 3 years running right about Arsenal being bottle jobs, waiting to be proven wrong
29/10/23, 2:35 am - James: @61409710717 Odegaard dropped ☠️
29/10/23, 2:36 am - Gerrard: Wow Arteta did do something right for once
29/10/23, 2:50 am - Pero: Odegaard has played almost every single premier league game in the last 3 seasons he needs a rest
29/10/23, 2:58 am - Liam: Arsenal did a great job! ❤️ Mikel resting players, great management, keeping the whole squad active 🐐
29/10/23, 2:59 am - Gerrard: Typical Arteta, taking way too long to rest a player
29/10/23, 2:59 am - Gerrard: How's Saka these days?
29/10/23, 3:00 am - Liam: Mikel’s arsenal 😍 Still in all competitions, in the title race, top of our CL group!
29/10/23, 3:02 am - Gerrard: My sweet sweet Liam, I feel bad for you the most. God bless.
29/10/23, 3:09 am - Pero: He captained the side for the first time 💪

29/10/23, 9:56 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 are we allowed to look at the table now that it's been 10 games?
29/10/23, 9:57 pm - James: Yeah top six all good 👍
29/10/23, 9:57 pm - James: Spurs are top though so what does that tell you really?
29/10/23, 9:58 pm - Gerrard: So you're saying 10 not enough, how many more games?
29/10/23, 9:58 pm - James: I don't watch your games so ☠️
29/10/23, 9:59 pm - James: 38 usually. Always been that way?
29/10/23, 9:59 pm - James: You're starting to sound like 'top of the league at Christmas' arsenal fans atm <This message was edited>
29/10/23, 9:59 pm - James: Even worse this is only ten games!
29/10/23, 9:59 pm - Gerrard: Ok, Hey Everyone!

29/10/23, 10:00 pm - James: @14244893404 remember the sledging you got from Jezzy last season for being happy to be top at xmas
29/10/23, 10:00 pm - James: Jezzy is jizzing his team are in the top four after ten games 😂
29/10/23, 10:00 pm - James: Oh how the supposedly once mighty have fallen 😂
29/10/23, 10:00 pm - Gerrard: Oh I'm not even looking at Liverpool's position, just looking for how far away Newy is from top 5.
29/10/23, 10:01 pm - James: Kloppy really has done in your expectations these days hasn't he 😂

1/11/23, 7:06 am - James: Congratulations for picking a team that was successful before you were born 😂
1/11/23, 7:43 am - Gerrard: Caught em on an off day innit
1/11/23, 7:44 am - Gerrard: Quite distance between beating United 7-0 vs beating Newy when the had an extra man
1/11/23, 7:45 am - Gerrard: Wow, unprovoked attack much
1/11/23, 7:45 am - Gerrard: And after he was born ❤️

1/11/23, 7:50 am - Gerrard: I just asked about score predictions
1/11/23, 7:50 am - Gerrard: Nekt minit
1/11/23, 7:51 am - Gerrard: Beating United 7-0 isn't an awesome event anymore

1/11/23, 9:53 pm - Dave: Some trophy only small clubs care about
1/11/23, 9:53 pm - Dave: 🤷🏼‍♂️
1/11/23, 9:54 pm - Jono: I’ll reserve my judgment of this cup till 8.30am
1/11/23, 9:54 pm - Jono: But seeing Yanited getting rinsed again is worth it
1/11/23, 9:54 pm - Jono: At the Theatre of Tears
1/11/23, 9:59 pm - Gerrard: I was about to laugh at United, then I saw something funnier.....
1/11/23, 10:00 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 what colours is London?
1/11/23, 10:01 pm - James: Manure getting cooked by Newcastle reserve reserves
1/11/23, 10:03 pm - James: Hall and Livramento are too good to be on the bench

1/11/23, 10:03 pm - James: 3-0?

1/11/23, 10:07 pm - Gerrard: Bet Declan is regretting his decision

1/11/23, 10:08 pm - Jono: I’m staying quiet
1/11/23, 10:08 pm - Jono: Bournemouth just scored
1/11/23, 10:08 pm - Jono: Lol
1/11/23, 10:09 pm - James: So if you go out and Arsenal go out Newcastle have won this trophy 100% then 😂
1/11/23, 10:09 pm - Jono: Specials
1/11/23, 10:09 pm - James: Can't wait to book another trip to Wembley
1/11/23, 10:10 pm - James: Manure will have to put the big guns on second half so nothing is over yet

1/11/23, 10:26 pm - Dave: Oh I’m going quadruple
1/11/23, 10:27 pm - James: Varpool fans were saying they were the best team in the world season before last when they won carabou
1/11/23, 10:27 pm - Dave: Pen, VARpool at it again
1/11/23, 10:27 pm - Dave: Remember United fans saying they were winning the quadruple last season after beating you
1/11/23, 10:27 pm - Jono: There’s no VAR
1/11/23, 10:27 pm - Jono: Lol
1/11/23, 10:29 pm - Dave: VARpool has just become synonymous with everything going Liverpools way. Doesn’t matter whether it goes VAR or not, liverpool just get away with it
1/11/23, 10:30 pm - Jono: Was there a pen? Not seeing anything on my feed.
1/11/23, 10:32 pm - Jono: Detecting frustration at losing to your inferior London neighbour with a close to full strength side
1/11/23, 10:32 pm - Jono: At least Rice had a happy homecoming
1/11/23, 10:34 pm - Dave: Training exercise
1/11/23, 10:34 pm - Dave: Cool as a cucumber. Fuck energy cup. Boys got a good run in before Newcastle this weekend

1/11/23, 10:35 pm - James: Since we already went to the trouble of knocking citeh out of this one
1/11/23, 10:37 pm - Jono: Reminds me of when Arteta started playing YNWA on speakers at training
1/11/23, 10:37 pm - Jono: #panic
1/11/23, 10:37 pm - Dave: Did you beat us last season? 👀
1/11/23, 10:37 pm - Dave: Arteta is a genius
1/11/23, 10:37 pm - Jono: Geniuses win stuff
1/11/23, 10:38 pm - Jono: I do feel yuck saying that as that implies Pep as one
1/11/23, 10:38 pm - Dave: God help me in this chat if we get stuffed this weekend. Chat will be muted and I’ll leave my phone in the drawer all weekend

1/11/23, 10:41 pm - James: Ten Hag panicking now
1/11/23, 10:41 pm - Dave: Nothing makes me happier. You know it was only in like jan/feb this year they were talking about winning the quad, rashford was better than Henry and Bruno was better than KDB
1/11/23, 10:41 pm - James: 3-0 😂😂😂
1/11/23, 10:41 pm - James: Can't believe we lost to these in the final

1/11/23, 10:42 pm - James: True
1/11/23, 10:42 pm - James: I am aware of what's happening

1/11/23, 10:43 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 Bigger fish to fry?
1/11/23, 10:43 pm - Dave: Like I said, training exercise. No one cares about energy cup. Just kicking a ball about on pitch innit
1/11/23, 10:43 pm - Dave: “Bigger fish to fry”

2/11/23, 12:54 am - James: Moyes in for a shout for trophy number 2
2/11/23, 12:54 am - James: Where would manure be if they stuck with him 😮
2/11/23, 12:54 am - Jono: It's open for at least a trip to Wembley given Port Vale v Boro is one of the QFs lol
2/11/23, 12:55 am - James: Newcastle v Varpool semi
2/11/23, 12:55 am - James: With the draws we've had in all comps. That'll be it
2/11/23, 12:56 am - Jono: Chelsea will be tough
2/11/23, 12:56 am - Jono: That's about all they can play for this season
2/11/23, 12:57 am - James: Pretty sure he was trying to throw that manure game with that line up
2/11/23, 12:57 am - James: He'll probably go for it now it's QFs

2/11/23, 1:21 am - James: Jez Jennings is back
2/11/23, 1:22 am - Gerrard: A second ago you were saying Newy were gonna lose to United and Arsenal, next minute they're beating Chelsea and Liverpool to win the cup
2/11/23, 1:25 am - James: Can't I change my opinion?
2/11/23, 1:25 am - James: That not allowed in the Group Chat for the Republic of Jez and his Allies
2/11/23, 1:28 am - Jono: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CzHvRAmNkAa/?igshid=NjFhOGMzYTE3ZQ==
2/11/23, 1:31 am - Gerrard: Wow starting to sound rattled, bring up old bits
2/11/23, 1:32 am - James: Do you think Varpool will go back to last seasons style once they get a few injuries or will the wheels come off once Luiz Diaz's fathers head is sent to the training ground?
2/11/23, 1:37 am - Jono: I’m sure Tonali has found a market for Diaz’s dads fate.
2/11/23, 1:44 am - Jono: That'll be an interesting week for LFC

Nurses, Doctors, Black Lives Matter AND Luis Diaz's Dad!
2/11/23, 2:23 am - James: Charges 😂
2/11/23, 2:23 am - James: Thought it was NSW that was the nanny state
2/11/23, 2:28 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 when was Arsenal's last trophy win?
2/11/23, 2:28 am - Pero: Ridiculous. They'll be going to gyms and charging people doing dumb bell forward shoulder raise
2/11/23, 2:29 am - Gerrard: Yeah and straight leg high stepping around town
2/11/23, 2:30 am - Pero: 3-1 is hardly a humiliating thrashing. Considering owning goal and deflection. 1st goal should of been disallowed if var wasn't against us
2/11/23, 2:30 am - Pero: Own goal *
2/11/23, 2:33 am - James: Never?
2/11/23, 2:39 am - James: Are moustaches illegal in Australia yet? Going to be a lot of fines being handed out this month if so
2/11/23, 2:42 am - James: If we win the caraboo cup and win nothing else it's a shit season!?
2/11/23, 2:42 am - James: So, they ain't winning that now and won't win anything else so it's a shit season sealed already then?
2/11/23, 2:43 am - James: @61409710717 last season was a shit season? These guys confuse me
2/11/23, 2:46 am - Jono: The Harry Maguire redemption tale lasted 1 week
2/11/23, 2:48 am - Pero: They will allow Freddy mercury moe's. Fuhrer, Stalin, Hussein moe's you'll be punished
2/11/23, 3:00 am - Gerrard: Don't be confused, it was shit
2/11/23, 3:00 am - Gerrard: It was just really good for them
2/11/23, 3:04 am - James: Out of all comps first round and 2nd nowhere near citeh who they think they were as good as even though they won all competitions they were in except league cup <This message was edited>
2/11/23, 3:05 am - Gerrard: Negative, City didn't get the league cup
2/11/23, 3:06 am - Gerrard: But yes that was a good season for them
2/11/23, 3:52 am - Dave: So I heard a little rumour about Goldbridge. Apparently he isn’t even a United fan, he’s a Nottingham forest fan just monetising shit talking United and doing these watch alongs hahaha 😂
2/11/23, 3:52 am - Jono: Wouldn’t be surprised
2/11/23, 3:52 am - Dave: Always thought it was strange how this huge super fan didn’t go to any of the games and sat in front of his cam on YouTube
2/11/23, 3:54 am - Dave: He’s such a twat this bloke, can’t believe you watch him
2/11/23, 3:56 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 more distracting from the game this morning
2/11/23, 3:59 am - James: Like some of the boys in here except the YouTube part
2/11/23, 3:59 am - James: 🫣
2/11/23, 4:00 am - Gerrard: Settled down Lewis
2/11/23, 4:01 am - Dave: FYI, Think he’s referring to you @61409710717
2/11/23, 4:02 am - Dave: I’d rather shit in my hands and clap than watch more Carabao cup games. No one cares about this apart from small clubs. If “liverpool are back”, shouldn’t you be talking about champions league and prem
2/11/23, 4:03 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I think he's talking to you
2/11/23, 4:08 am - James: Rattled
2/11/23, 4:08 am - James: Think arteta would love a carabou cup
2/11/23, 4:08 am - Gerrard: Proper
2/11/23, 4:08 am - James: Fans of teams always say it's shit when they get knocked out init
2/11/23, 4:09 am - Gerrard: Just to win something with the team he put together
2/11/23, 4:09 am - James: Yeah what has he won
2/11/23, 4:09 am - James: Five years now?
2/11/23, 4:10 am - Gerrard: I still see that last trophy as Emery's trophy
2/11/23, 4:10 am - Gerrard: I just thought of something.....
2/11/23, 4:10 am - Gerrard: If Pep retires.....
2/11/23, 4:11 am - Gerrard: Where will Arteta get his tactics and gameplans from?
2/11/23, 4:14 am - Dave: Charity shield is bigger than carabao, that’s how much of a non event it is
2/11/23, 4:14 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 wow
2/11/23, 4:15 am - Dave: FA cup, charity shields. What’s howe won
2/11/23, 4:15 am - Dave: Longest spot at top of league without winning the league trophy
2/11/23, 4:15 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 attacking Howie now
2/11/23, 4:16 am - Dave: Love howe
2/11/23, 4:16 am - James: Can't see how that's possible since it's only one game and Arsenal were invited into it because citeh won everything
2/11/23, 4:17 am - Dave: 1955
2/11/23, 4:17 am - James: Howe took a team about to go into administration from bottom of league 2 to the PL and kept them there for five years
2/11/23, 4:18 am - James: Can't see arteta doing that
2/11/23, 4:18 am - Dave: Segregation was still legal in the states and aboriginals weren’t allowed to vote when Newcastle last won a trophy
2/11/23, 4:18 am - James: Howe kept a Steve Bruced bottom of the league Newcastle in the PL in half a season and then finished top four in his first full season.
2/11/23, 4:19 am - James: Can't see arteta doing that
2/11/23, 4:19 am - James: Won in 69 and intertoto in 2006 so incorrect stats again
2/11/23, 4:19 am - Dave: Steve Bruce was a fantastic manager operating under the constraints of Mike Ashley. It was cruel what you fans did to him. Then Eddie hopped into the driving seat backed by a load of blood money and he’s suddenly a genius. Disgraceful
2/11/23, 4:20 am - James: @61409710717 think he's rattled
2/11/23, 4:20 am - Dave: Won’t ever forget Brucey crying in that interview that Newcastle fans threatened his family
2/11/23, 4:20 am - Dave: So sad. #justiceforbrucey
2/11/23, 4:24 am - Gerrard: Bruce just happy to being mentioned in shittalk still
2/11/23, 4:32 am - James: Looks like a snow man that's been hit with a shovel
2/11/23, 4:36 am - Dave: You should thank brucey @61452662705, wouldn’t have howe without him
2/11/23, 4:38 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 🪇
2/11/23, 4:40 am - James: West Ham > Arsenal
2/11/23, 4:47 am - James: Hopefully they didn't see any of his managerial career after Birmingham
2/11/23, 4:47 am - James: Would have killed them
2/11/23, 4:50 am - James: Now do trophies last season
2/11/23, 4:51 am - James: And transfer fees paid for mid players from each other
2/11/23, 6:59 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 🤣 we've gotten to screenshots of the table
2/11/23, 7:00 am - Gerrard: West Ham has more trophies in recent years
3/11/23, 5:40 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 does Rodders ever post anything on here worth the time it took to watch?
3/11/23, 6:01 am - Dave: You’re such a miserable cunt
3/11/23, 6:03 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 😱
3/11/23, 6:03 am - Gerrard: Well I never....
3/11/23, 6:21 am - Jono: You just noticed?
3/11/23, 7:11 am - James: Wow
3/11/23, 8:08 am - Gerrard: Wow
3/11/23, 8:11 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 truth be told Bob and Rodders are the same type of mainstream populist people
3/11/23, 1:52 pm - Jono: Truth be told I’m also a miserable cunt, though I have less time to show it.
3/11/23, 4:23 pm - Dave: I’ll take that as a compliment
3/11/23, 11:20 pm - Gerrard: You guys should hook up
3/11/23, 11:52 pm - Dave: Jealous Jez
4/11/23, 12:17 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CzHiCSxL1GH/?igshid=aHNkeWp0aWl0d2ls
4/11/23, 3:11 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 when are you going to apologise to @61404060785 about your early Nunez calls?
4/11/23, 3:24 am - Jono: What was said about Captain Chaos?
4/11/23, 10:57 am - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/shorts/rYgVGFdMRxk?si=asv5Ptvmz-BhZ_0z
Such a Rodders
4/11/23, 3:05 pm - Gerrard: Can feel the nerves for the big game in here, so quiet.
4/11/23, 8:32 pm - James: Morning @14244893404 @61478754484 @61422023136
4/11/23, 8:32 pm - James: How are we???
4/11/23, 8:33 pm - James: Your boys took a helluva beating 😂 <This message was edited>
4/11/23, 8:34 pm - Jono: Well done NewVARstle
4/11/23, 8:34 pm - Jono: 🤣
4/11/23, 8:34 pm - James: Sorry, can't take you seriously after the gunners will win by 2 😂😂😂
4/11/23, 8:34 pm - Jono: Just saw the goal
4/11/23, 8:35 pm - Jono: Great win though that’s a foul and the ball was also out
4/11/23, 8:35 pm - James: 😂
4/11/23, 8:35 pm - James: Cry more
4/11/23, 8:36 pm - Jono: Draw was my preferred result here
4/11/23, 8:36 pm - James: @61409710717 when does fan reactions come out?
4/11/23, 8:37 pm - James: Down to the bare bones we had to play Matt Ritchie 😂
4/11/23, 8:37 pm - Jono: And Newy winning 2nd pref, But the irony of your varspiracy for LFC after this call is not lost on me
4/11/23, 8:38 pm - James: If your opinion on it mattered to me I'd suppose I'd take on board what you're saying but here we are 😁
4/11/23, 8:40 pm - Jono: As I said, great win. You’ll smoke in 5th now
4/11/23, 8:42 pm - Jono: 🤣🤣🤣
4/11/23, 8:42 pm - James: Ian Wright looks like he's going to cry
4/11/23, 8:43 pm - James: CL qualification! I'd take that!
4/11/23, 8:43 pm - Jono: If Gabriel was a ball then Joelinton gets the goal
4/11/23, 8:43 pm - James: Gabriel is weak as piss
4/11/23, 8:43 pm - Jono: Pretty sure he pushed him into the net haha
4/11/23, 8:43 pm - James: So overrated
4/11/23, 8:44 pm - James: Livramento had Martinelli today
4/11/23, 8:44 pm - James: How did Havertz stay on the pitch. What a waste of money
4/11/23, 8:46 pm - James: 'unbeaten this season' cunts have lost three times in all comps already 😂
4/11/23, 9:10 pm - Dave: Are you joking 😂😂😂 you were on the back foot the entire game. 

Bruno should have been sent off, absolutely liability that lad. Pathetic. And your goal… the ball was out of play number 1. Number 2 Joelinton threw gabby to the floor and number 3 it was offside. 

You’re VARcastle from now on, what a joke
4/11/23, 9:10 pm - Liam: Fair play newy, good game
4/11/23, 9:10 pm - James: Varsenal created absolutely nothing today
4/11/23, 9:10 pm - Liam: Exciting
4/11/23, 9:11 pm - James: Martinelli couldn't get past our 20 year old reserve right back
4/11/23, 9:11 pm - James: Lascelles was a rock
4/11/23, 9:11 pm - James: You got spanked today
4/11/23, 9:11 pm - James: Humbled @61409710717
4/11/23, 9:12 pm - Dave: I’ve got to admit, it reminded me of the old Arsenal and United games back in the early noughties. Great game, very exciting and full of passion. Don’t see that mcuh in todays game
4/11/23, 9:12 pm - Liam: Yep
4/11/23, 9:12 pm - Liam: Great game, I’m happy for newy
4/11/23, 9:13 pm - James: Whole ball wasn't out of play, the middle of the ball wasn't. It's round not square 😂😂😂
4/11/23, 9:13 pm - James: Gabriel is so wank. So weak. Joelinton's bitch
4/11/23, 9:13 pm - James: Howe had mincy Arteta's panties down
4/11/23, 9:16 pm - Dave: No you’re not. Stop lying
4/11/23, 9:16 pm - Dave: Scummy cunts should have been down to ten men in first half
4/11/23, 9:17 pm - Dave: Goal shouldn’t have counted from that mincey knacker
4/11/23, 9:17 pm - Jono: Bruno getting away with another off the ball strike to the head? Well I never!
4/11/23, 9:17 pm - Dave: https://x.com/rizzo_x8/status/1720868968729088294?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA

4/11/23, 9:18 pm - Liam: Really really happy 😊
4/11/23, 9:18 pm - Dave: You see this @61404060785 ?
4/11/23, 9:18 pm - James: Even your Varpool mate can't get Newcastle out of his head this morning
4/11/23, 9:18 pm - Dave: Worst part is VAR REVIEWED THIS 😂😂😂
4/11/23, 9:18 pm - Jono: Haha unreal
4/11/23, 9:20 pm - Liam: I thought he had his best game
4/11/23, 9:20 pm - Liam: I actually noticed he was playing
4/11/23, 9:20 pm - Dave: So Havertz went for the ball, gets a yellow
4/11/23, 9:20 pm - Liam: Putting himself about
4/11/23, 9:20 pm - Dave: Bruno intentionally elbows a lad in the back of the head when the ball is on the other side of the pitch. Nothing
4/11/23, 9:20 pm - James: Real humbling for you today
4/11/23, 9:21 pm - James: Created nothing
4/11/23, 9:21 pm - Liam: Not humbling, just humble
4/11/23, 9:21 pm - Dave: We all know the refs are on Qatari and Saudi payroll
4/11/23, 9:21 pm - James: Against Jamall Lascelles and Matt Ritchie
4/11/23, 9:21 pm - Liam: Game was decided on a scrappy goal
4/11/23, 9:21 pm - Dave: Doing cashies in the Middle East
4/11/23, 9:21 pm - James: Humbling
4/11/23, 9:21 pm - Dave: Embarrassing
4/11/23, 9:21 pm - James: Out the cup
4/11/23, 9:21 pm - James: Out the league
4/11/23, 9:22 pm - James: Wheels coming off. Two big defeats in a row now
4/11/23, 9:22 pm - Liam: You need to sit down and calm down
4/11/23, 9:22 pm - Dave: Shit atmosphere as well. Quiet in SJP, fake fortress
4/11/23, 9:22 pm - Liam: Atompshere was good on my coverage
4/11/23, 9:23 pm - Dave: Arsenal fans louder than the pie munchers
4/11/23, 9:23 pm - Liam: I liked the game, it was like footy back in the 90s
4/11/23, 9:23 pm - Liam: Ya I heard them to be fair
4/11/23, 9:23 pm - James: Absolutely steaming
4/11/23, 9:23 pm - Dave: https://x.com/fabrizioromano/status/1720898676577468465?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
4/11/23, 9:24 pm - James: When the flight to Bali? Long time to reflect @61478754484 ✈️✈️✈️
4/11/23, 9:24 pm - Liam: Fair comment
4/11/23, 9:24 pm - Liam: Now
4/11/23, 9:24 pm - Liam: lose signal in a min, perfect
4/11/23, 9:24 pm - James: He's so embarrassing @61409710717
4/11/23, 9:25 pm - Dave: Now I know how liverpool felt against Tottenham. Total robbery
4/11/23, 9:25 pm - James: Maybe focus on how he got out thought tactically by Howe
4/11/23, 9:25 pm - Jono: Replay?
4/11/23, 9:25 pm - James: Varsenal created 0
4/11/23, 9:25 pm - Dave: What was Howes tactics, 11 men in the box and cry for the last 30 mins?
4/11/23, 9:26 pm - James: Arteta got silenced today
4/11/23, 9:26 pm - James: Not good enough
4/11/23, 9:26 pm - James: When Arteta out?
4/11/23, 9:26 pm - Jono: Took him 2 gos to get it right - did it for 45 against 10 men and it didn’t work
4/11/23, 9:26 pm - Liam: Seems reasonable
4/11/23, 9:27 pm - James: Of course the Varpool fan tries so hard to make it about Varpool 😂
4/11/23, 9:28 pm - James: It cements my belief that Varpool fans are the weirdest in the world. Some of them anyway, not you @61409710717
4/11/23, 9:28 pm - James: Just go on twitter and Varpool fans doing their best to stay relevant 😂
4/11/23, 9:28 pm - James: We beat Newcastle champions
4/11/23, 9:29 pm - James: Fucking weirdos
4/11/23, 9:29 pm - James: What was Lego peps?
4/11/23, 9:29 pm - Jono: I’m sure you’ll always have the we beat mbappe cup after you slide down to Europa
4/11/23, 9:30 pm - James: Go to SJP and lose 😂
4/11/23, 9:30 pm - James: Try harder. Make it about you 🫵
4/11/23, 9:31 pm - James: https://x.com/Edit_Kev/status/1720870584060371416?s=08
4/11/23, 9:32 pm - James: Ooft is Joe Willock as well. Wounds and salt

4/11/23, 9:34 pm - Dave: Nunez “the donkey” single handedly dismantled “the best defence in the league”
4/11/23, 9:35 pm - James: You aren't taking this well are you
4/11/23, 9:36 pm - Dave: If you were the better team and deserved it, I’d tip my hat to you boys
4/11/23, 9:36 pm - Dave: But you weren’t
4/11/23, 9:36 pm - Dave: Dog shit and the officiating was a joke
4/11/23, 9:36 pm - James: Oh no
4/11/23, 9:36 pm - Dave: I hope arteta kicks up a massive fuss and has the same effect that klopp got after spurs
4/11/23, 9:37 pm - James: Really struggling ❤️
4/11/23, 9:38 pm - James: That's your Saturday afternoon and evening ruined @14244893404
4/11/23, 9:38 pm - James: Liam has a long flight to Bali
4/11/23, 9:38 pm - James: Shame
4/11/23, 9:38 pm - Jono: Gez is gonna ejaculate when he sees 135 unreads
4/11/23, 9:39 pm - James: I'm trying to wake him up!
4/11/23, 9:39 pm - James: Might start calling him in a sec
4/11/23, 9:39 pm - Jono: Acid come downs take a while
4/11/23, 9:40 pm - James: Not as long as the rage within @14244893404 @61478754484
4/11/23, 10:51 pm - James: https://youtu.be/o2meJjAF7Vs?feature=shared
4/11/23, 11:04 pm - Dave: Puts tabs on his cornflakes that lad
5/11/23, 12:24 am - Gerrard: I don't enjoy seeing Newy win games
5/11/23, 12:24 am - Gerrard: Wow
5/11/23, 12:26 am - Gerrard: But I don't like seeing a Rattlefest 🪇🪇🪇ai yay yay🪇🪇🪇
5/11/23, 12:27 am - Louie: Does this mean Arsenal are turning to shit like United?
5/11/23, 12:27 am - Gerrard: They always were
Also United didn't deserve shit from that game, Fulham defenders threw that away
5/11/23, 12:28 am - Louie: Yeah that goal was so scrappy
5/11/23, 12:28 am - Louie: But Bruno just does GOAT things
5/11/23, 12:29 am - Gerrard: https://bleacherreport.com/videos/485365-artetas-postgame-presser
5/11/23, 12:30 am - Gerrard: He's trash and you know it, he fucked up everything up until that shot, then the defenders fucked it and Leno should've saved it.
I watched the game live, very disappointing
5/11/23, 12:40 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I'm awake
5/11/23, 12:55 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 can't believe the VAR didn't call the ref over to see the screen
5/11/23, 12:57 am - James: Talking out his arse
5/11/23, 12:57 am - James: They weren't robbed. Sore losers
5/11/23, 12:58 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/6FMBwHR7l78?si=7Redga9Kf4f1Z3me
5/11/23, 1:14 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/AV-KCHEYt64?si=SsVchjkiiOF6EjMZ
Arteta says it's no longer the best league in the world
5/11/23, 1:17 am - James: He's so dramatic. Too emotional
5/11/23, 1:17 am - Gerrard: Tottenham Invincibles?
5/11/23, 1:20 am - Gerrard: How's about Brighton throwing away their shot at 5th
5/11/23, 1:20 am - James: Ohh do they usually get this upset when they lose their first league game of the season
5/11/23, 1:21 am - James: Yeah, Havertz should have been off
5/11/23, 1:22 am - James: https://youtu.be/0aUsqlTZNVo?feature=shared
5/11/23, 1:22 am - James: @61409710717 they're starting to turn on mini pep
5/11/23, 1:23 am - Gerrard: I'd like to point out that I said Arteta was a conman before it was cool to say it
5/11/23, 1:24 am - James: @61409710717 wheels deffo starting to come off. Beating sheff last week doesn't mask the fact they've been spanked by Lens, West Ham, us and got away with it against spurs and chelsea
5/11/23, 1:25 am - James: I thought they'd be unbeatable they way they were going on about inverted full backs and centre backs stepping up into midfield. Revolutionary!
5/11/23, 1:48 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/HAmIJzwRDxE?si=lkgsay60fCA1ZIv1
5/11/23, 1:49 am - Gerrard: "weak underbelly"
5/11/23, 1:50 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 IF Livo beat Luton and go above Arsenal, are they officially back?
5/11/23, 1:51 am - Jono: Fucking hell
5/11/23, 1:51 am - Jono: Arteta is making Klopp look good
5/11/23, 1:51 am - Jono: That is an all time explosion
5/11/23, 1:52 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 you'll be a fan of Rory after this one
5/11/23, 1:53 am - Dave: https://x.com/arsenalbuzzcom/status/1720898792105410794?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
5/11/23, 1:53 am - James: I mean the bar is low but wow. Arteta is embarrassing
5/11/23, 1:56 am - Dave: @61452662705 you should watch this, realise how lucky you are. You’re half the team you were last season, VARcastle have to rely on Saudi payroll refs
5/11/23, 1:56 am - Dave: We keep getting robbed, poor guy just wants reform like Klopp
5/11/23, 1:56 am - Dave: Something needs to change
5/11/23, 1:56 am - James: @61409710717 he's not coping well
5/11/23, 1:57 am - Gerrard: That wouldn't have been a goal if Ramsdale was there
5/11/23, 1:57 am - Dave: We all need to get behind the change. Everyone should be outraged. Sound familiar @61409710717 ?
5/11/23, 1:57 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I think he's talking to you
5/11/23, 1:57 am - James: @61409710717 did you see how bad White was for the goal? And Raya?
5/11/23, 1:57 am - Dave: Because the ball was out of play
5/11/23, 1:57 am - Gerrard: WEAK UNDERBELLY
5/11/23, 1:57 am - Gerrard: It didn't go out mate
5/11/23, 1:57 am - Dave: They all were waiting for the goal kick lol
5/11/23, 1:58 am - James: @61409710717 I think he is genuinely likening the goal to the actual robbery of Diaz at spurs
5/11/23, 1:58 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 he's picking the weakest argument
5/11/23, 1:58 am - Dave: Yes it did. The only reason they didn’t call it was because they didn’t have a camera over that part of the pitch
5/11/23, 1:58 am - James: It really didn't go out
5/11/23, 1:58 am - James: Bein Sports also proved it didn't go out
5/11/23, 1:58 am - James: This is getting really desperate @61409710717
5/11/23, 1:58 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 not enough cameras now, when it doesn't look out on the camera they did have
5/11/23, 1:59 am - Gerrard: I'll give a foul on poor man's Matip Gabriel, but not out and not offside
5/11/23, 2:00 am - Dave: https://x.com/arsenal_tickets/status/1720887977956552732?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
5/11/23, 2:00 am - James: You have to be a retard to even need this proved to you. The ball is not square. The middle part is over the line. Just
5/11/23, 2:00 am - Dave: “No conclusive evidence”
5/11/23, 2:00 am - James: Weak as piss and was looking for it. Was already on the way down. Shit defender
5/11/23, 2:00 am - Dave: But James knows better than the professionals. We pRoVed iT!!!
5/11/23, 2:01 am - Gerrard: Lol 🪇🪇🪇
5/11/23, 2:01 am - James: If that's the case then there is none to disallow it either and they stick to the on field decision
5/11/23, 2:01 am - Dave: So Gabriel wasn’t fouled either? The double handed push on the back and shoulders down to the ground wasn’t an issue?
5/11/23, 2:01 am - James: @61409710717 rattle emoji time?
5/11/23, 2:01 am - Gerrard: He's shifted
5/11/23, 2:02 am - Gerrard: Lol no, no I didn't
5/11/23, 2:02 am - Gerrard: *it
5/11/23, 2:02 am - Gerrard: There is no evidence that proves it went out so it's refs call
5/11/23, 2:02 am - James: Varsenal fans should be focused on how their supposed title winning team and manager came to SJP and created nothing all game and made horrendous mistakes in defence
5/11/23, 2:03 am - James: Exactly
5/11/23, 2:04 am - Dave: More shots, more possession, more chances, more passes, more time spent in your half. You had your backs against the wall for the second half like every time you play a decent club. Clinging on for dear life time wasting. Classic Newcastle
5/11/23, 2:05 am - Gerrard: I think the things VAR fucked up, not telling the ref to go look at the screen for the Joelington foul and not sending off BrunoG
5/11/23, 2:05 am - Gerrard: More goals
5/11/23, 2:06 am - Gerrard: And I do believe that Arteta is using all this to distract from him starting Havertz and Jorginho
5/11/23, 2:07 am - Dave: Well there’s that as well. Whole game was a shambles. Total robbery
5/11/23, 2:08 am - Dave: And let’s be honest, Havertz should have got a red as well
5/11/23, 2:08 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 nonballs
5/11/23, 2:09 am - Dave: *noble
5/11/23, 2:13 am - James: Meltdown
5/11/23, 2:13 am - James: Not the stuff of champions @61409710717
5/11/23, 2:14 am - Gerrard: Why would anything Arsenal be the stuff of champions???
5/11/23, 2:14 am - Gerrard: The stuff of BottleJobs
5/11/23, 2:14 am - James: Humbled today
5/11/23, 2:19 am - James: @61409710717 Pope only had one save to make from a weak Martinelli effort.

Couldn't get anything through the middle. Schar and third choice Laceslles gave them nothing. Saka pocketed by trippier out of position and Martinelli stopped by our reserve 20 year old full back. No wonder Arteta is so pissed off
5/11/23, 2:20 am - Gerrard: Easy pal, I still hate Newy
5/11/23, 2:23 am - James: Ditto Varpool, their fans, and everything associated with them
5/11/23, 2:24 am - James: No lol
5/11/23, 2:29 am - Dave: “If liverpool beat the worst team in the league tomorrow, are we back”
5/11/23, 2:43 am - James: They still managed to make a game between Newcastle and Arsenal about them
5/11/23, 2:45 am - Gerrard: Once again Rodders focusing on the wrong point
5/11/23, 2:45 am - Gerrard: Rodders, talking about Arsenal sliding down the table mate!
5/11/23, 2:46 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/YTrnp2JBMy0?si=yczTCa9yuP-1MstY
5/11/23, 2:48 am - Dave: Wow. Actually in shock https://x.com/kimmofc/status/1720918126961787253?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
5/11/23, 2:49 am - Dave: Why do you send these videos targeted at 10 year olds
5/11/23, 2:49 am - Gerrard: 🪇
5/11/23, 2:51 am - Gerrard: So you don't think Arsenal are in crisis?
I thought we were all agreed
5/11/23, 2:58 am - Dave: What’s the crisis?
5/11/23, 2:59 am - Dave: Unbeaten team gets beaten? Crisis?
5/11/23, 3:06 am - James: @61409710717 unbeaten!?
5/11/23, 3:06 am - James: Did lens and west ham not happen!?
5/11/23, 3:06 am - Gerrard: Lens?
5/11/23, 3:06 am - Gerrard: Hammers?
5/11/23, 3:07 am - James: Some team in France?
5/11/23, 3:07 am - James: Hadn't heard of them either
5/11/23, 3:07 am - Gerrard: You remember when signing Rice was gonna make them unstoppable?
5/11/23, 3:29 am - James: Was he playing today?
5/11/23, 3:30 am - Pero: What an absolute dis-race
5/11/23, 3:31 am - Pero: I feel embarrassed turning on optus sport and being apart of this
5/11/23, 3:32 am - Pero: Wreckless mofo thinks its bjj
5/11/23, 3:41 am - Gerrard: I guess Arsenal are out of dis-title-race
5/11/23, 3:50 am - James: They don't look like challengers
5/11/23, 3:50 am - James: Is Havertz capable of having a good game?
5/11/23, 3:50 am - James: At all? Ever?
5/11/23, 3:50 am - Gerrard: I'm glad they had a nice season last year while all the real teams had a season off
5/11/23, 3:53 am - Pero: This will be the moment when the arteta flood light comes out 💡
5/11/23, 3:53 am - James: Wouldn't it have been better to keep Willock
5/11/23, 3:53 am - James: Then sell him
5/11/23, 3:53 am - James: Then buy havertz
5/11/23, 3:54 am - James: Perhaps he should have plugged in his globe and shined it over the line and ball
5/11/23, 3:54 am - Dave: He had a great game today
5/11/23, 3:54 am - James: He was crap
5/11/23, 3:54 am - James: Joelinton's biatch
5/11/23, 3:57 am - Gerrard: He hasn't paid the electricity bill mate
5/11/23, 3:57 am - James: Can't even afford dog food atm. Poor 'Win' went missing today
5/11/23, 3:59 am - James: What. A. Sledge.
5/11/23, 4:00 am - Pero: It was defiently only a yellow on kai, nothing further
5/11/23, 4:00 am - Dave: I just looked at it again. 100% a yellow. Was his trailing leg that made contact
5/11/23, 4:01 am - Gerrard: Losing 1-0 to Newy, comedy gold to watch he says
5/11/23, 4:01 am - Dave: King Kai had the varcastle midfield on a leash
5/11/23, 4:02 am - Pero: Considering var give the softest contact on someones toe as penalites, and now saying the double hand push on Gabriel is not enough contact is poor. The inconsistency is shameful
5/11/23, 4:02 am - Gerrard: So you agree with Klopp and Rory?
5/11/23, 4:03 am - Pero: About ?
5/11/23, 4:03 am - Gerrard: VAR
5/11/23, 4:03 am - Gerrard: And referees
5/11/23, 4:06 am - James: £60 million 😂
5/11/23, 4:06 am - Dave: Worth every penny watching him dismantle your midfield
5/11/23, 4:07 am - James: Go to bed maybe?
5/11/23, 4:07 am - James: Sleep this off?
5/11/23, 4:11 am - Pero: Yes the standard needs mass improvement
5/11/23, 4:16 am - Dave: Rolls Royce defender. He’s world class
5/11/23, 4:17 am - Dave: Manhandles players like Joelinton
5/11/23, 4:19 am - Pero: Not an obvious and massive gap between the ball and the line
5/11/23, 4:24 am - Pero: Ridiculous
5/11/23, 4:29 am - Liam: Newy we’re lucky
5/11/23, 4:29 am - Gerrard: Oh my sweet sweet Liam, run
5/11/23, 4:30 am - Gerrard: Fuck yeah, hold onto the little wins - just not the actual wins
5/11/23, 4:31 am - Pero: The ref's are not gonna give us actual wins so we may aswell get the ones we can
5/11/23, 4:50 am - Gerrard: Not out, focus on the foul you git
5/11/23, 4:50 am - Dave: Closest image we have “over” the round ball James. Count your lucky stars for the gift you got today
5/11/23, 4:50 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/85suiy4-f3E?si=ovSGzu1xKxA6a32U
5/11/23, 4:50 am - Dave: It clearly is. Focus on the foul? Which foul? Too many issues with todays game, disgraceful
5/11/23, 4:51 am - Gerrard: After ball was kept in, Joelington foul Poor Man's Matip
5/11/23, 4:51 am - Gerrard: *fouled
5/11/23, 4:52 am - Dave: Mate if it’s even questionable and there’s no VAR tech in that part of the field, you err on the side of caution
5/11/23, 4:53 am - Dave: So much wrong today
5/11/23, 4:53 am - Pero: Just watched the full first half. Even the 3 newy yellows after kai's foul was weird. Other then the refs, great intense game. Reminds you of the oldskool man utd v arsenal fueds
5/11/23, 4:58 am - James: It's not out you spaz
5/11/23, 4:59 am - James: Joe Willock been racially abused by Varsenal fans
5/11/23, 5:01 am - James: Defensive master-class. Could still be playing now and you wouldn't have scored. Stop Saka and Martinelli you stop Varsenal 🛑😂
5/11/23, 5:02 am - James: https://x.com/beINSPORTS_EN/status/1720890425244803079?s=08
5/11/23, 5:43 am - Dave: What I said earlier! Great seeing all that passion from both sides
5/11/23, 5:44 am - James: Ref was shit for both teams
5/11/23, 5:47 am - Dave: Are you joking 😂😂😂😂 this is your evidence 😂😂😂😂 

They’re confused themselves what they’re looking at LOL. Some CGI render.

And BeIn sports are Qatari owned, so I’m guessing this is a really impartial opinion <This message was edited>
5/11/23, 5:48 am - James: You really don't understand spheres do you
5/11/23, 5:48 am - James: Yeah, Qatar hate Saudi 😂😂😂
5/11/23, 5:49 am - James: They stole their broadcasts for years 😂
5/11/23, 5:49 am - James: What a mare

5/11/23, 5:52 am - James: And no they don't hahahahaha
5/11/23, 5:53 am - James: Qatar won PSG you wazzock
5/11/23, 6:02 am - Dave: No they don’t, ouch. I’ll delete that comment and pretend it never happened 😂😂
5/11/23, 6:03 am - James: Bein Sports would do anything to prove that was out 😂
5/11/23, 6:16 am - Pero: Whats the grey line they are drawing is the actual white line underneath the grey one ?
5/11/23, 6:22 am - James: Yeah
5/11/23, 7:30 am - James: Shouldn't have been
5/11/23, 7:31 am - Dave: Agree in this instance
5/11/23, 7:31 am - Dave: That ball was out today though
5/11/23, 7:31 am - James: Big hug
5/11/23, 7:38 am - James: Still going on about the ball being out
5/11/23, 7:39 am - James: Oh and Varsenal fans been sending racist messages to Newcastle's black players <This message was edited>
5/11/23, 7:40 am - James: Pride of London?
5/11/23, 7:40 am - Gerrard: And not the foul and handball???
Misguided as usual with Arsenal fans
5/11/23, 7:41 am - Gerrard: Don't they have midnights in the team?
5/11/23, 7:41 am - James: Been sending them to one of their own in Willock
5/11/23, 7:42 am - Gerrard: Newcastle own Beinsports?
5/11/23, 8:43 am - James: Don't embarrass yourself like Rodwell
5/11/23, 8:46 am - Gerrard: That's why I'm asking
5/11/23, 8:48 am - Gerrard: Seems like a ridiculous thing to say that the footage from a coverage would be different because the channel is owned by a country that isn't the country that owns one of the teams involved.
5/11/23, 9:00 am - James: Rodwell said Qatar own Citeh and Varsenal are Citehs biggest rival and wanted them to drop points
5/11/23, 9:44 am - Gerrard: Soooooo Beinsports bribed the refs?
5/11/23, 10:15 am - Jono: I’m still recovering from Arteta
5/11/23, 10:16 am - Jono: That was seriously all time
5/11/23, 11:14 am - James: Shame some of their fanbase decided to be racists after getting whooped this morning too
5/11/23, 12:13 pm - Liam: Lots of newy fans coming out saying they got lucky
5/11/23, 1:44 pm - Gerrard: The honest ones?

5/11/23, 6:52 pm - Dave: Look, if you believe a CGI render created by BeIn that couldn’t even draw the line parallel or get the colour of the match ball correct, go for gold. 

Just remember PGMOL said it was inconclusive, if it was that simple do you not think they would have released an image confirming? 

On top of that, it was 100% a foul on
Gabriel and a handball 🤷🏼‍♂️ robbery, end of
5/11/23, 8:23 pm - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CzROTtHRedE/?igshid=am9rcmxramtkY2U5
Best keeper in the world....
5/11/23, 8:51 pm - Dave: We not going to talk about how you were two minutes away from losing to the worst team in the league?
5/11/23, 8:52 pm - Gerrard: But we didn't 👌🏻
5/11/23, 8:52 pm - Gerrard: But I guess Arsenal fans would still be happy with a draw, we're not
5/11/23, 8:52 pm - Dave: A point against Luton for “title challengers” is a loss
5/11/23, 8:52 pm - Gerrard: Agreed
5/11/23, 8:53 pm - Jono: We deserved to lose
5/11/23, 8:53 pm - Gerrard: But we're not gonna whinge about a ball being out for days
5/11/23, 8:53 pm - Dave: So not back? Or back?
5/11/23, 8:53 pm - Gerrard: Not back
5/11/23, 8:54 pm - Gerrard: Or back to 2016 Livo
5/11/23, 8:54 pm - Gerrard: Losing against little guys
5/11/23, 8:56 pm - Gerrard: Livo not back > gonna win the league Arsenal
5/11/23, 8:56 pm - Gerrard: 🤷🏼‍♂️
5/11/23, 8:59 pm - Dave: Let’s be honest here, you haven’t played anyone yet except for spurs and Brighton. Spurs beat you and you drew with Brighton
5/11/23, 9:00 pm - Gerrard: Nice try Rodders, no one's forgetting your bottle job yesterday and Arteta's embarrassing dummy spit
5/11/23, 9:01 pm - Dave: So klopp spits his dummy out and “we’ve all got to get behind klopp for the good of the league” 

Arteta does the same and he’s embarrassing. Got it
5/11/23, 9:02 pm - Gerrard: Wow @61452662705
5/11/23, 9:02 pm - Gerrard: Cute that he's copying Arteta by chucking in an "embarrassing"
5/11/23, 9:02 pm - Jono: Dave go and enjoy the rest of your sunday 

It’s Monday here. It’s depressing enough without all this negative energy
5/11/23, 9:04 pm - James: Varpool are back @61409710717?
5/11/23, 9:05 pm - Gerrard: Jimmy you're missing the mark here, it's Day 2 of Rodders on his rag about losing to Newy
5/11/23, 9:05 pm - James: Oh the humanity!
5/11/23, 9:05 pm - James: You should have lost to LUTON
5/11/23, 9:05 pm - Gerrard: But we didn't 👌🏻
5/11/23, 9:05 pm - James: How's the gap going @61404060785?
5/11/23, 9:06 pm - James: Tick tock
5/11/23, 9:06 pm - Gerrard: AND we're above Arsenal and Newy 👌🏻
5/11/23, 9:06 pm - James: Not for long
5/11/23, 9:06 pm - James: You can't even beat Luton 😂😂😂
5/11/23, 9:06 pm - Gerrard: Nice theory
5/11/23, 9:06 pm - James: @14244893404 any fist bumps today?
5/11/23, 9:06 pm - Gerrard: But we beat Newy sooooooo Luton > Newy?
5/11/23, 9:07 pm - James: Did they run around the pitch celebrating like they won the league by default again?
5/11/23, 9:07 pm - Gerrard: Nah we aren't Arteta bro
5/11/23, 9:07 pm - James: Sorry
5/11/23, 9:08 pm - Gerrard: Thank you
5/11/23, 9:08 pm - James: We aren't focusing on Arsenal losing to a really good team yesterday
5/11/23, 9:08 pm - Dave: Yep
5/11/23, 9:08 pm - Gerrard: 🤣
5/11/23, 9:08 pm - James: Luton
5/11/23, 9:08 pm - Dave: Luton are a championship team
5/11/23, 9:08 pm - Dave: Like imagine scrambling against Luton backs against the wall whilst proclaiming you’re back and are title contenders
5/11/23, 9:09 pm - Gerrard: Come on give it to us, put your energy into trying to get to us
5/11/23, 9:09 pm - Gerrard: Mmmmmm tasty
5/11/23, 9:10 pm - James: I bet they were so sure they'd win this morning 😂
5/11/23, 9:10 pm - Gerrard: Love you version of facts
5/11/23, 9:10 pm - Gerrard: *your
5/11/23, 9:10 pm - James: Can only imagine the horror they felt during that match
5/11/23, 9:10 pm - Gerrard: Ah yeah so sure
5/11/23, 9:10 pm - James: God I wish I was there to see it 😋
5/11/23, 9:11 pm - Gerrard: So much horror I barely slept through the whole thing
5/11/23, 9:12 pm - Gerrard: Gimme more, keep it up
5/11/23, 9:12 pm - James: Who was that? 😂😂😂
5/11/23, 9:13 pm - James: @14244893404 where are they?
5/11/23, 9:14 pm - James: Haven't played citeh yet either 🤔
5/11/23, 9:17 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 you're wasting you energy on us and letting Rodders off here bud
5/11/23, 9:17 pm - Gerrard: You could've pushed Rodders on the rag out to a full week, such wasted potential
5/11/23, 9:18 pm - Gerrard: Back because above Arsenal?
5/11/23, 9:18 pm - Gerrard: I think that's fair
5/11/23, 9:21 pm - James: What a great weekend of footy
5/11/23, 9:22 pm - Gerrard: Now you know we feel most weekends
5/11/23, 9:22 pm - Gerrard: ❤️
5/11/23, 9:22 pm - James: Pipe down bud. Go back to bed maybe
5/11/23, 9:23 pm - James: I hope Diaz was booked for his celebration @14244893404?
5/11/23, 9:23 pm - Gerrard: Did that one hurt, sorry
5/11/23, 9:23 pm - James: You're very active this morning. Very rattled. Turn the chat off for a few hours
5/11/23, 9:27 pm - Gerrard: Nah just seeing messages from  you makes me feel better about dropping points to Luton
5/11/23, 9:29 pm - Dave: Course they were. Jez was celebrating before the game even kicked off. “We’re back”
5/11/23, 9:30 pm - Dave: 3 guesses
5/11/23, 9:30 pm - Dave: Haven’t played you, city, us, United, Chelsea 😬😬
5/11/23, 9:31 pm - Gerrard: Fast asleep
5/11/23, 9:32 pm - Gerrard: One thing you need to learn lads, even if we've beaten City 3-0, we still feel like we're gonna lose to a lesser team
5/11/23, 9:39 pm - James: @14244893404 they're just not as good as they think they are. They never learn do they
5/11/23, 9:42 pm - Dave: I had a liverpool fan tell me none of arsenals midfield would get into their new midfield on Friday night. 

“Rice wouldn’t get a look in over endo or mac” 

Pure delusion
5/11/23, 9:42 pm - Gerrard: I think that could apply to everybody here
5/11/23, 9:43 pm - Gerrard: And this hurt you?
5/11/23, 9:44 pm - Gerrard: Rice is a donkey though
5/11/23, 9:44 pm - Dave: Just don’t know why you didn’t back us against the common enemy VAR, we all got behind Klopp
5/11/23, 9:45 pm - Gerrard: I wonder why 🤔
5/11/23, 9:48 pm - Dave: Clearly never watched him play then. Klopp would give his left nut for Rice
5/11/23, 9:49 pm - Gerrard: Still a donkey
5/11/23, 9:51 pm - James: @14244893404 I think fluking that win at SJP got to their heads a bit
5/11/23, 9:51 pm - James: Nice humbling for them today ❤️
5/11/23, 9:52 pm - Dave: Oh absolutely. Right back in their box
5/11/23, 9:54 pm - James: Yeah they've been very loud recently
5/11/23, 10:05 pm - Dave: Luton towns entire starting 11s weekly wage is like 70% of Salah’s weekly wage @61452662705.

David vs Goliath
5/11/23, 10:06 pm - Gerrard: Nunez only scores against Newy
5/11/23, 10:06 pm - Gerrard: Worth every penny
5/11/23, 10:07 pm - Gerrard: Ain't never gonna be humble
5/11/23, 10:10 pm - James: Was Diaz booked
5/11/23, 10:13 pm - James: Disgraceful he was played today
5/11/23, 10:13 pm - James: Poor from klopp <This message was edited>
5/11/23, 10:14 pm - Gerrard: At least he made it Diaz's choice and didn't force him like Howie did to BETonali
5/11/23, 10:15 pm - Jono: Hang on, I thought Tonali was a victim? 🙏😢
5/11/23, 10:18 pm - James: What a shit goal
5/11/23, 10:18 pm - James: Looked like an own goal tbf
5/11/23, 10:18 pm - James: Nunez is a donkey
5/11/23, 10:18 pm - James: Cost ya today
5/11/23, 10:19 pm - James: Who cares
5/11/23, 10:20 pm - Gerrard: Wow
5/11/23, 10:21 pm - Gerrard: Tick tock until Newy get screwed by VAR and the tune changes
5/11/23, 10:22 pm - James: Did Varsenal release a club statement 😂😂😂
5/11/23, 11:02 pm - Dave: 🤝💪
5/11/23, 11:05 pm - Gerrard: Fair play to em
5/11/23, 11:05 pm - Gerrard: Not fair play to Arsenal and Newty
5/11/23, 11:05 pm - James: Who's that
5/11/23, 11:05 pm - James: Giants?
5/11/23, 11:06 pm - James: Europa teams are giants?
5/11/23, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 shows your opinion means nothing
6/11/23, 12:08 am - James: @14244893404 aside from us, who have Varpool beat this season?
6/11/23, 12:09 am - James: We've beaten arsenal, Citeh, Manure and PSG
6/11/23, 12:09 am - James: Just wondering where all this big dick energy has come from this season?
6/11/23, 12:09 am - James: From a fluke win at SJP?
6/11/23, 12:21 am - Pero: Poor poonez starting to feel sorry for him now
6/11/23, 1:13 am - Gerrard: 🤣
6/11/23, 1:14 am - Gerrard: I'm not
6/11/23, 1:14 am - Gerrard: Gutless
6/11/23, 1:14 am - Gerrard: Wow, why aren't Liverpool fans supporting Arsenal after this weekend.....🤔
6/11/23, 1:15 am - James: What's there to support?
6/11/23, 1:15 am - James: And, who have Varpool beat this season?
6/11/23, 1:16 am - Gerrard: Ya mum
6/11/23, 1:23 am - James: Wow
6/11/23, 1:28 am - James: This Luton thing has got to you hasn't it ❤️
6/11/23, 1:28 am - Gerrard: Nah, just thought of you two think it has is annoying
6/11/23, 1:28 am - James: Still images
6/11/23, 1:29 am - Gerrard: Donkey punched
6/11/23, 1:29 am - James: He was on his way down to head under the ball. He's weak and shit
6/11/23, 1:29 am - Dave: Innit
6/11/23, 1:29 am - James: Knew he's was fucked the second big Joe came running in
6/11/23, 1:29 am - James: Come again?
6/11/23, 1:30 am - James: Take the L Rodwell. Don't be like these pansy Varpool fans <This message was edited>
6/11/23, 1:30 am - Gerrard: Yeah don't be live
6/11/23, 1:30 am - Dave: Was he crouching to head the ball when it was two metres away from him?
6/11/23, 1:30 am - James: Say what?
6/11/23, 1:31 am - Dave: We were robbed. Better side in every way
6/11/23, 1:31 am - Gerrard: Gotta be questioning Raya here
6/11/23, 1:32 am - James: Defensive master class. Still be playing now and you'd not score
6/11/23, 1:32 am - Gerrard: Can't wait for Newy to level out and we can go back to miserable Jimmy
6/11/23, 1:32 am - Dave: Bruno the murderer
6/11/23, 1:32 am - James: This is some meltdown
6/11/23, 1:32 am - James: Still going 24hr later
6/11/23, 1:32 am - James: How long does it last?
6/11/23, 1:33 am - James: Can't wait to see if Varpool actually do something this season that warrants all the big boy talk
6/11/23, 1:34 am - Gerrard: Favela whore
6/11/23, 1:34 am - James: Cryteta
6/11/23, 1:38 am - Gerrard: Can we all address Jimmy's logic?
If Liverpool aren't a big team anymore because of one season outside the CL then I don't believe Newty should shake off the garbage fire title after just one season in the CL.
Thoughts?
6/11/23, 1:40 am - James: Huh?
6/11/23, 1:40 am - James: Just asked who you beat this season?
6/11/23, 1:41 am - James: You don't rate Newcastle so that doesn't count in your mind
6/11/23, 1:41 am - James: So, who you beat so far?
6/11/23, 1:54 am - Gerrard: I told you already, are you thick?
6/11/23, 2:12 am - James: You're thicc
6/11/23, 2:12 am - James: Not me mate
6/11/23, 2:32 am - James: Wow
6/11/23, 2:36 am - James: Horrible little man aren't you
6/11/23, 2:36 am - James: I say little
6/11/23, 2:50 am - Gerrard: 👌🏻
6/11/23, 2:59 am - Pero: He was giving them a chance initially and being the composed manager that he usually is but since then it's happened to often and now enough is enough
6/11/23, 3:01 am - Pero: Wreckless out of control
6/11/23, 3:03 am - James: Agree with that. Not sure what that was about
6/11/23, 3:03 am - James: Jorginho actually a Brazilian who decided to play for Italy?
6/11/23, 3:04 am - Pero: Yep pretty sure he jumped the Brazilian ship and made his way to Italy
6/11/23, 3:07 am - James: So that elbow to the head was his own fault really
6/11/23, 3:15 am - Pero: Wreckless nationalist racist
6/11/23, 3:19 am - Gerrard: No yellow card so able to post match sanction him
6/11/23, 4:47 am - Dave: What about this one. Who’s fault was this https://x.com/xtreamx22/status/1720904406340673711?s=46&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
6/11/23, 5:37 am - James: You had forty minutes to get back into the game
6/11/23, 5:37 am - James: And you did fuck all
6/11/23, 5:48 am - James: https://www.youtube.com/live/0iDcRyO78rA?feature=shared
6/11/23, 5:48 am - James: https://youtu.be/rVbxxUZoEGI?feature=shared
6/11/23, 5:48 am - James: Carra saying Varpool ain't all that @14244893404
6/11/23, 5:59 am - Gerrard: Whoa wait a minute, were we gonna win the league this season???? DAMN IT!!!!
6/11/23, 6:00 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/l5yYgAUZ3a0?si=1eKD71BWOyzACXsZ
Youngins copping it
6/11/23, 6:01 am - James: All I saw was Nuni fucking up chances in the three minute highlights?
6/11/23, 6:02 am - Gerrard: Harvey getting blamed for the goal
6/11/23, 6:02 am - James: Didn't he assist the goal?
6/11/23, 6:04 am - James: https://youtu.be/xuWFsE-YR-o?feature=shared
6/11/23, 6:04 am - Gerrard: I blame Salah
6/11/23, 6:04 am - James: https://youtu.be/75NJSX_QRww?feature=shared
6/11/23, 6:05 am - Gerrard: Same thing I posted noob
6/11/23, 6:05 am - James: Is it good to blame the thing that is the sole reason you're in the top four currently?
6/11/23, 6:05 am - Gerrard: You saying it evens out?
6/11/23, 6:06 am - Gerrard: Your opinion is in the toilet bowl this year
6/11/23, 6:06 am - James: Where would ya be without Salah!?
6/11/23, 6:07 am - James: This is akin to Varsenal fans blaming Wenger
6/11/23, 6:07 am - James: Such a cruel man
6/11/23, 6:09 am - Dave: He was quick to turn hey
6/11/23, 6:09 am - James: Did he say they would win?
6/11/23, 6:09 am - James: Neville said Varsenal would win it 🤔
6/11/23, 6:10 am - Gerrard: Negative, Rodders facts again
6/11/23, 6:10 am - Gerrard: Been Trumping too long, he has
6/11/23, 6:10 am - Gerrard: Big FoxNews guy
6/11/23, 6:11 am - Gerrard: Takes a while to type also
6/11/23, 6:12 am - James: Got ya
6/11/23, 6:12 am - Gerrard: Like when he said the ball was out
6/11/23, 6:12 am - James: Makes sense with all the conspiracy theories about yesterdays L
6/11/23, 6:12 am - Dave: He’s such a bizarre specimen. Has it all apart from actually finishing. Like it’s comical at this stage. It’s got to be nerves or something, just bottle job in his blood. He’s the kind of player that will be world class if can get his finishing sorting out, 20-25 a season
6/11/23, 6:13 am - James: Yeah that's just sad really
6/11/23, 6:13 am - Gerrard: Should play for Arsenal then
6/11/23, 6:13 am - James: Can talk about whether it was a foul or not
6/11/23, 6:13 am - James: But the ball being out is a tragic one
6/11/23, 6:14 am - James: @61409710717 they just haven't been firing this season
6/11/23, 6:14 am - Dave: See Neville is now putting the knife into arteta
6/11/23, 6:14 am - James: They got found out yesterday
6/11/23, 6:14 am - Dave: Find that offensive. I’m more woke than you
6/11/23, 6:14 am - James: Stopping the central play and making them toss the ball into the box
6/11/23, 6:15 am - Dave: I’d love him at arsenal. Arteta would get something out of him. Our world class wingers and midfielders would get him scoring in no time
6/11/23, 6:15 am - James: Not when you come up against a team that knows how you play. What was with the time wasting yesterday @14244893404. That 0-0 at the Emirates seems to still be under crytetas skin
6/11/23, 6:16 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 his way of saying he loves trans chicks
6/11/23, 6:16 am - James: Everyone is tbf
6/11/23, 6:16 am - James: Yesterday was embarrassing
6/11/23, 6:18 am - James: @14244893404 watch the MOTD analysis of the game. It's actually very good
6/11/23, 6:18 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I think it's criminal that ETH is getting hammered but Arteta has been getting a free pass all this time
6/11/23, 6:18 am - James: Wow
6/11/23, 6:18 am - James: Wow and accurate @61409710717
6/11/23, 6:19 am - Gerrard: Thank you sir, I speak truths
6/11/23, 6:22 am - James: @14244893404 Arteta hasn't signed well this summer has he?
6/11/23, 6:47 am - Gerrard: Think we broke him
6/11/23, 6:57 am - James: https://youtu.be/kDD-7S8mRaM?feature=shared
6/11/23, 7:04 am - Dave: You come out the closet yet or what. Safe space here ❤️
6/11/23, 7:05 am - Dave: You comparing the bloke that loses every week to the bloke that rarely drops points
6/11/23, 7:06 am - Dave: Declan Rice and Timber total flops 👌
6/11/23, 7:06 am - James: Where's timber
6/11/23, 7:06 am - James: Overpaid for Rice
6/11/23, 7:07 am - James: Raya and Havertz?
6/11/23, 7:07 am - Dave: Injured 😢
6/11/23, 7:07 am - James: You have two keepers with no confidence
6/11/23, 7:07 am - Dave: Raya is a great signing
6/11/23, 7:07 am - James: Ok
6/11/23, 7:07 am - Dave: Havertz had some wonderful games recently as well
6/11/23, 7:08 am - James: @61409710717 he saying you are gay
6/11/23, 7:08 am - James: No
6/11/23, 7:08 am - James: But OK
6/11/23, 7:08 am - James: https://youtu.be/4lVr3spvK0I?feature=shared
6/11/23, 7:45 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 a lot of messages.... 🪇
6/11/23, 7:45 am - Gerrard: Kick out homophobia
6/11/23, 7:57 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 was it Saliba that fell over?
6/11/23, 8:02 am - James: Doesn't matter really does it
6/11/23, 8:03 am - James: And racism
6/11/23, 8:05 am - Gerrard: I just thought he was supposed to be this incredible strong cb
6/11/23, 8:06 am - Gerrard: Same challenge for the Diaz goal but the Luton player didn't fall over like a bitch
6/11/23, 8:06 am - James: Not strong enough 🤷
6/11/23, 8:06 am - Gerrard: Real man

6/11/23, 10:13 pm - Jono: VDV looks like a bad hamstring tear… could hardly walk
6/11/23, 10:13 pm - Jono: Maddison limped off
6/11/23, 10:13 pm - Jono: Probably bad also considering he realised he couldn’t run it off
6/11/23, 10:13 pm - Jono: Spurs should’ve had Udogie sent off too
6/11/23, 10:14 pm - Jono: Went double feet studs up and missed Sterlings shins by a few can
6/11/23, 10:14 pm - Jono: Cms*
6/11/23, 10:29 pm - Dave: That was an awful red
6/11/23, 10:29 pm - Dave: And I hate spurs
6/11/23, 10:29 pm - Dave: Not a red in a month of Sundays
6/11/23, 10:32 pm - James: He's off
6/11/23, 10:32 pm - James: Could be a bad weekend for North London
6/11/23, 10:38 pm - James: Chelsea are trash
6/11/23, 10:45 pm - Jono: High line suicide from Ange
6/11/23, 10:47 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 shook innit
6/11/23, 11:01 pm - Dave: Total shit
6/11/23, 11:01 pm - Dave: They should be running rampant here
6/11/23, 11:01 pm - Dave: Spurs are still looking like they’re in it
6/11/23, 11:01 pm - Dave: 9 men since 55 mins lol
6/11/23, 11:07 pm - Jono: “Heroic loss” there’s a new one

6/11/23, 11:08 pm - Chris: Fuck ange. Piece of shit. Mate
6/11/23, 11:09 pm - Gerrard: Countdown to stroppy Ange?
6/11/23, 11:15 pm - Dave: Bet he goes out and puts a straight face on it
6/11/23, 11:15 pm - Dave: Tries to keep up the “class act” image
6/11/23, 11:16 pm - Dave: “Well youse win some and lose some mate. Today the decisions didn’t goes our way mate but that’s life, I’m proud of the boys mate”
6/11/23, 11:18 pm - James: North London humbled @61409710717
6/11/23, 11:21 pm - Dave: Totally humbled by VAR
6/11/23, 11:22 pm - Gerrard: Ange tactics getting torn apart
6/11/23, 11:22 pm - Gerrard: Highline with 9 men
6/11/23, 11:22 pm - James: @61409710717 he's still going on about var
6/11/23, 11:22 pm - Gerrard: Can't adapt
6/11/23, 11:22 pm - Gerrard: It's....... embarrassing!
6/11/23, 11:22 pm - James: Australian managing in the prem is just embarrassing
6/11/23, 11:23 pm - James: Fuck off back to Scotland or Japan mate
6/11/23, 11:24 pm - Gerrard: Nah he's greek
6/11/23, 11:24 pm - James: True my bad
6/11/23, 11:24 pm - James: Wog cunt init
6/11/23, 11:26 pm - Gerrard: Victorian prick
6/11/23, 11:26 pm - Gerrard: Ange said he didn't like waiting around for VAR today
6/11/23, 11:27 pm - Gerrard: North London hates VAR apparently
6/11/23, 11:28 pm - James: He didn't in October
6/11/23, 11:29 pm - Dave: Watching post match interview. Sounds like he’s about to cry

@61413646755
6/11/23, 11:30 pm - Dave: Interviewer stoking the fire 😂
6/11/23, 11:30 pm - Jono: Tbh Ange's quote sounds a lot like @61409710717 most of the time on this chat
6/11/23, 11:30 pm - Jono: So its good to see you're both alike in that respect
6/11/23, 11:30 pm - Gerrard: Is he quoting Arteta?
6/11/23, 11:30 pm - Jono: And don't deny it Gez
6/11/23, 11:31 pm - Gerrard: Can't wait for a reporter to ask Ange a question he doesn't like
6/11/23, 11:31 pm - Jono: All we all want is improved standards and processes
6/11/23, 11:31 pm - James: Damn
6/11/23, 11:31 pm - Jono: Meanwhile City are just running away with the league, again
6/11/23, 11:32 pm - Gerrard: He's trying to win over the populace after his hero has fallen
6/11/23, 11:32 pm - Jono: I'm all about quality, not quantity in this chat.
6/11/23, 11:32 pm - Gerrard: Take your medicine Bob
6/11/23, 11:32 pm - James: Hero?
6/11/23, 11:33 pm - Gerrard: Bob loves everything Ange
6/11/23, 11:33 pm - Jono: Only idiots would call this heroic
6/11/23, 11:33 pm - James: Thought you meant Nunez
6/11/23, 11:33 pm - Jono: I don't for one
6/11/23, 11:33 pm - Gerrard: Would suck his cock if the opportunity arises
6/11/23, 11:33 pm - Jono: Gez now going below the belt
6/11/23, 11:33 pm - Gerrard: That's his crush
6/11/23, 11:33 pm - Jono: Coz he knows he got owned by the Ange comparison
6/11/23, 11:33 pm - James: Hey if that is what he wants then who are we to judge
6/11/23, 11:34 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 don't you dare talk about Nunez ok
6/11/23, 11:34 pm - James: He wants to suck it as well?
6/11/23, 11:34 pm - Dave: Ange or nunez?
6/11/23, 11:34 pm - Jono: He'd probably be more a wristy kind of guy
6/11/23, 11:34 pm - Gerrard: Gotta love a guy who claims wins on his own comments
6/11/23, 11:34 pm - Dave: Reckon gez would double team it
6/11/23, 11:34 pm - James: Shit but not shit shit?
6/11/23, 11:35 pm - James: So confused. Dicks everywhere
6/11/23, 11:35 pm - Jono: Sword fights
6/11/23, 11:35 pm - Jono: Haha where is this chat going oh my
6/11/23, 11:35 pm - Jono: Anyway back to work
6/11/23, 11:35 pm - Jono: ** mute **
6/11/23, 11:35 pm - Dave: Can’t drop grenades and then mute
6/11/23, 11:36 pm - James: Dropping loads and bailing
6/11/23, 11:36 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 Bob is also the type of guy that will change the sports team he supports because he supports a player.
6/11/23, 11:36 pm - Jono: Its what i do
6/11/23, 11:36 pm - Dave: Gez just picking up his sword to fight back
6/11/23, 11:36 pm - Dave: Pork sword
6/11/23, 11:36 pm - Gerrard: Says mute but still here
6/11/23, 11:36 pm - Gerrard: This is the type of guy Bob is
6/11/23, 11:37 pm - Gerrard: I'm sorry Ange lost today and I'm happy about it Bob
6/11/23, 11:57 pm - Gerrard: Out of his depth
7/11/23, 12:34 am - Jono: Back from mute ville to brighten your day @61409710717
7/11/23, 12:34 am - Jono: Corica sacked
7/11/23, 12:36 am - Gerrard: Already know mate go back on mute you Angeophile
7/11/23, 1:22 am - James: What was that
7/11/23, 1:23 am - Dave: Angeball
7/11/23, 1:25 am - James: Suicide
7/11/23, 1:25 am - James: Chelsea have no creativity.
7/11/23, 1:25 am - James: But they have pace
7/11/23, 1:26 am - James: Better to have sat in low block 🤷
7/11/23, 1:38 am - Dave: Handed them game
7/11/23, 1:40 am - Pero: I just watched the mini match seriously what the hell was with high line Ange , it looked like a training run
7/11/23, 1:41 am - Pero: And Jackson has worse finishing then poonez
7/11/23, 1:41 am - Pero: What a weird match
7/11/23, 2:09 am - Pero: Wow 😮
7/11/23, 2:21 am - Dave: The only tables Nunez makes the top 10 in are “big chances missed”, “shots” and “hit woodwork”
7/11/23, 2:48 am - James: https://youtube.com/shorts/zgkiuxkpDdg?feature=shared

🤨
7/11/23, 3:16 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 who'd have thought Arteta's dummyspit would be overshadowed so quickly
7/11/23, 3:17 am - James: Mugging cryteta there mate
7/11/23, 3:21 am - Pero: Why not 🥳🥳, gotta take the wins when the ref's don't let us have em
7/11/23, 3:21 am - Pero: They got richarlison 🙄
7/11/23, 3:21 am - Gerrard: Lol only thing to celebrate each year innit

7/11/23, 3:30 am - James: Chelski could have just set their players in their own half close to the centre circle and sprinted from their own half as a ball over the top gets played (no offside). They should have scored 10 <This message was edited>
7/11/23, 3:45 am - Dave: What a fucking brown nose, knew he was going to play that card
7/11/23, 3:46 am - Dave: Insane isn’t it
7/11/23, 3:47 am - James: Great weekend of footy
7/11/23, 3:59 am - Dave: Apart from being robbed
7/11/23, 3:59 am - Dave: Good to see potentially wheels off spurs
7/11/23, 4:01 am - James: You weren't robbed
7/11/23, 4:01 am - Dave: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CzPY0fPvlln/?igshid=MTNhMjd3bTVoNDNteQ==
7/11/23, 4:01 am - James: What were you robbed of
7/11/23, 4:01 am - Dave: You played like a Sunday league team and got a scrappy illegitimate goal. Robbed blind
7/11/23, 4:02 am - James: You got beaten, deservedly, by the better team
7/11/23, 4:03 am - James: You have to let it go
7/11/23, 4:03 am - James: You're just not what you think you are
7/11/23, 4:13 am - Dave: I reckon it actually wrecks you mentally knowing that you didn’t deserve that and you got a gift from the Saudi VAR gods
7/11/23, 4:25 am - James: @61409710717 can you help him
7/11/23, 4:26 am - Gerrard: Who?
7/11/23, 5:42 am - Pero: In croatian it means a little thick 😅
7/11/23, 6:54 am - James: How's those three points? 3⃣
7/11/23, 7:01 am - James: https://x.com/NewcastleFansTV/status/1721650812579987741?s=08
7/11/23, 7:02 am - James: Here @14244893404 Gary Neville is trying to help you
7/11/23, 7:05 am - Gerrard: Liverpool and Arsenal have nothing in common, Livo got screwed by VARs human error and Arsenal are just crying that a refs call didn't go their way
7/11/23, 7:05 am - James: Not remotely the same is it 😂
7/11/23, 7:06 am - Gerrard: Cry babies trying to hitch their wagon to Livo's travesty
7/11/23, 7:06 am - James: Dissss graaaace
7/11/23, 7:06 am - Gerrard: Em
7/11/23, 7:06 am - Gerrard: Barassing
7/11/23, 7:07 am - James: @61409710717 this crap has infiltrated my private messages now
7/11/23, 7:07 am - James: I might have to block him
7/11/23, 7:08 am - Gerrard: No Arsenal fan in this group chat backed Livo against Tottenham and that is what's embarrassing
7/11/23, 7:10 am - Dave: You would have lost that game anyway after watching you play Luton. Not much has changed since last season
7/11/23, 7:11 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 look at this piss poor effort
7/11/23, 7:11 am - Gerrard: Arsenal and their fans are done
7/11/23, 7:11 am - Gerrard: No backbone
7/11/23, 7:11 am - Dave: 🪇
7/11/23, 7:12 am - Gerrard: Even this, putting no work into trying to rattle someone then posting a rattle emoji
7/11/23, 7:13 am - Dave: You’re rattled because you know what I said was true
7/11/23, 7:13 am - Gerrard: This is like good season coming 2nd
7/11/23, 7:13 am - Gerrard: Arsenal fans are cooked
7/11/23, 7:13 am - Dave: Cut to the bone didn’t it. Back to living in the past
7/11/23, 7:14 am - Gerrard: Told you Arteta is a bad leader and example
7/11/23, 7:14 am - Gerrard: He lost his head and all the fans follow
7/11/23, 7:14 am - Dave: Arteta backed klopp when he had his hissy fit and you’re still swinging posting fake news in here. You’d vote trump if you live here and watch Fox News
7/11/23, 7:14 am - Gerrard: AFTV jr in here
7/11/23, 7:16 am - James: Was the ball out @14244893404
7/11/23, 7:17 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 is Rodders Robbie jr or Try jr?
7/11/23, 7:17 am - Dave: Inconclusive
7/11/23, 7:18 am - Gerrard: *Ty
7/11/23, 7:18 am - James: Was Gordon offside?
7/11/23, 7:19 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 see AFTV jr
7/11/23, 7:19 am - James: I'm asking him about Gordon
7/11/23, 7:44 am - Dave: Inconclusive
7/11/23, 7:44 am - James: OK, that's two of the three
7/11/23, 7:45 am - James: And was it definitely a foul?
7/11/23, 7:45 am - James: 100% nailed on foul
7/11/23, 7:45 am - James: ?
7/11/23, 8:05 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 definitely Ty Jr
7/11/23, 8:26 am - Gerrard: Weak as piss defending
7/11/23, 8:30 am - James: From a photo
7/11/23, 8:30 am - James: He had already jumped up. He wasn't pushed
7/11/23, 8:33 am - James: @61409710717 subjective at best? So, all we have is aftv here, still salty, cryteta crying and Varsenal releasing club statements over what was two inconclusive events (so they have to stick with the onfield decision) and what was really a 50/50 call with Joelinton
7/11/23, 8:53 am - Pero: What about the crease fold in gabriel's jersey just above his number , seems this could only be created by substantial upwards pressure from a push in the back. Bring in var jersey assessment
7/11/23, 9:06 am - James: How do we know this picture hasn't been altered with AI?
7/11/23, 9:13 am - Liam: Fair play newy. They played a great game
7/11/23, 9:13 am - Gerrard: I'm embarrassed that my friends are acting like this.
7/11/23, 9:15 am - Pero: We may need to ask beIN sports about this one

@61452662705 thoughts?
7/11/23, 11:41 am - James: What happened to varpool was a farce. The game at SJP isn't comparable. Nothing happened to Varsenal other than they got spanked and lost an important game 🤷
7/11/23, 11:41 am - James: Ian Wright @61409710717
7/11/23, 11:41 am - Gerrard: To a depleted Newy
7/11/23, 11:41 am - James: Impartial much?
7/11/23, 11:42 am - James: 34 year old Ritchie was playing
7/11/23, 11:42 am - Gerrard: Ian "I thoughts you waz def" Wright
7/11/23, 11:42 am - James: Down to the bare bones and they did nuttin
7/11/23, 11:42 am - Gerrard: *ded
7/11/23, 11:42 am - James: Title charge?
7/11/23, 11:43 am - Gerrard: Him and Jorginho cancel each other out
7/11/23, 11:43 am - Gerrard: Were Arsenal on a title charge???
7/11/23, 11:44 am - Gerrard: I thought it was focus on retaining top 4
7/11/23, 11:44 am - Gerrard: Can't be dropping to 8th again
7/11/23, 11:44 am - James: They were saying the league was theirs this season
7/11/23, 11:44 am - James: Suits them?
7/11/23, 11:45 am - James: Varsenal and 8th is like peas and carrots
7/11/23, 11:48 am - Dave: Wheels are off your season. Half your squad is gone. 8th will be a good result for a team that plays like Sunderland now

7/11/23, 9:47 pm - James: Nah Wednesday
7/11/23, 9:47 pm - Gerrard: Ok, a new week of great footy then
7/11/23, 9:48 pm - James: Hope so
7/11/23, 9:48 pm - Gerrard: Lol
7/11/23, 10:10 pm - James: 💯
7/11/23, 10:17 pm - Dave: Ah the anti-arsenal agenda continues
7/11/23, 10:27 pm - Dave: 100% on this. Apart from arteta not backing klopp, incorrect - he backed klopp and Liverpool. Comments were taken out of context as usual. Like Klopp apparently “demanding a replay”. Klopp never said it, just replied yes to a question about replaying the fixture being fair
7/11/23, 11:13 pm - James: @61409710717 think his head has truly gone
7/11/23, 11:14 pm - James: Can you talk with him? He wants to call me after work but I dunno if I have the qualifications
7/11/23, 11:26 pm - Dave: Keep deflecting that attention. Bottom of the group 👀
7/11/23, 11:26 pm - Jono: Optus went down just like Newcastle, again. Brings back relegation memories
7/11/23, 11:27 pm - Jono: At least you’ve got the we beat mbappe cup
7/11/23, 11:27 pm - James: You mean bottom of the group we're expected to finish bottom of? Separated from top by three points?
7/11/23, 11:28 pm - James: Does this get you the three points you lost at the weekend?
7/11/23, 11:28 pm - James: Or like varpools title charge ending at Luton. Lols <This message was edited>
7/11/23, 11:29 pm - James: @61404060785 Varpool can't even beat a fucking English airport 😂
7/11/23, 11:30 pm - James: We beat Newcastle cup 🍵
7/11/23, 11:30 pm - James: He said Varsenal would win the league
7/11/23, 11:31 pm - James: Tight
7/11/23, 11:31 pm - Gerrard: Don't worry about them Jimmy, you said you didn't want Europa anyway
7/11/23, 11:31 pm - James: Group of Death init
7/11/23, 11:31 pm - James: I don't. Either 1st, 2nd or 4th
7/11/23, 11:31 pm - Dave: Not what you were saying after PSG.. “PSG got found out”
“All these leagues are farmers leagues”
7/11/23, 11:31 pm - Gerrard: I don't want to talk to him, your mate
7/11/23, 11:32 pm - Gerrard: 4th it is 👌🏻
7/11/23, 11:32 pm - Dave: When you say so
7/11/23, 11:32 pm - James: I don't want to brag about beating 'teams' like Toulouse or Stadiums of Brussels via Brugge
7/11/23, 11:33 pm - James: Does Nuni look like a world beater in the Europa?
7/11/23, 11:33 pm - Gerrard: Whoa why you attacking Liverpool now?
7/11/23, 11:33 pm - James: Can't bring myself to watch it
7/11/23, 11:33 pm - Gerrard: Rent free?
7/11/23, 11:33 pm - James: Your Suarez living mate had it coming
7/11/23, 11:33 pm - Dave: Oh we’re in this phase of the cycle again. I prefer it when we talk but we’re hostile, let me know when the dynamic shift is close
7/11/23, 11:33 pm - James: Not directed at you @61409710717
7/11/23, 11:33 pm - Gerrard: Or you lashing out at everyone because of today's result?
7/11/23, 11:33 pm - Dave: Maybe now actually now James has turned on liverpool
7/11/23, 11:34 pm - Gerrard: Shut up you Arteta apologist
7/11/23, 11:34 pm - James: Fair
7/11/23, 11:34 pm - Jono: Rollercoaster week @61452662705.
you can now focus on 5th
7/11/23, 11:35 pm - Gerrard: If anything this shows how shit Arsenal are
7/11/23, 11:35 pm - James: Nah still high. All good
7/11/23, 11:35 pm - James: That's not directed at Newcastle 😂
7/11/23, 11:35 pm - Dave: I was hoping you’d think it was
7/11/23, 11:36 pm - James: Be interesting to see how they get on against Burnley
7/11/23, 11:36 pm - Gerrard: Even if not, isn't it bad that it does relate to Newy
7/11/23, 11:36 pm - James: I'm not retarded like someone who thinks Qatar and Bein own Citeh
7/11/23, 11:37 pm - James: Should do one about the Moore  family
7/11/23, 11:37 pm - James: Another L?
7/11/23, 11:37 pm - Gerrard: You both can focus on the league soon
7/11/23, 11:38 pm - James: Actually I'll ask this to the most deluded Varpool fan on this chat, what exactly are Varpool focusing on?
7/11/23, 11:38 pm - James: You're not winning the league are ya?
7/11/23, 11:39 pm - Jono: Top 4 
UCL
7/11/23, 11:39 pm - James: So what's the focus after being lucky to finish in Europa last season?
7/11/23, 11:39 pm - Jono: Like every other club
7/11/23, 11:39 pm - James: Right, and you know 5th will be UCL right?
7/11/23, 11:40 pm - Jono: Yeah, what’s your point?
7/11/23, 11:40 pm - Jono: That’s why I said focus on 5th
7/11/23, 11:40 pm - Gerrard: Jimmy please make more sense, not following you.
Take a big breath and calm yourself before typing.
7/11/23, 11:40 pm - James: I'm calm. Calmer than you.
7/11/23, 11:41 pm - Jono: Breathe @61452662705
7/11/23, 11:41 pm - Jono: This is a safe space
7/11/23, 11:41 pm - James: So top 5?
7/11/23, 11:41 pm - James: Like us?
7/11/23, 11:41 pm - Jono: I’d rather top 4
7/11/23, 11:41 pm - James: Why?
7/11/23, 11:41 pm - Jono: 5th feels like we only earned coz UEFA are fucked
7/11/23, 11:42 pm - Dave: Liverpool are going to get top 4
7/11/23, 11:42 pm - James: Two countries get it I think
7/11/23, 11:42 pm - Jono: By adding another 50 teams to the UCL
7/11/23, 11:42 pm - James: The extra space
7/11/23, 11:42 pm - Jono: Can imagine trolls would feast on us finishing 5th
7/11/23, 11:42 pm - Gerrard: Can't be after the chat this morning
7/11/23, 11:42 pm - James: They should though. Look how much they've spent in recent years
7/11/23, 11:43 pm - Jono: “You only made the UCL coz every cunt can make it now”
7/11/23, 11:43 pm - James: It will be an actual league next season
7/11/23, 11:43 pm - James: Gone are the days only the actual champions played in it
7/11/23, 11:44 pm - Jono: Yep, it’s shit
7/11/23, 11:45 pm - James: Trolls will feast on you either way just like they always have because of your fans
7/11/23, 11:47 pm - Jono: I’d just rather finish top 4

Preferably top 2 behind Citeh who will win by 20
7/11/23, 11:47 pm - Dave: No way you’re getting fifth
7/11/23, 11:47 pm - Jono: But I’m aware we’re lacking a number 6
7/11/23, 11:47 pm - Dave: Who’s finishing above you?
7/11/23, 11:48 pm - Dave: City for sure, anything else is up for grabs
7/11/23, 11:48 pm - Jono: City

Maybe on Arsenal, Spurs
7/11/23, 11:48 pm - Dave: Think arsenal and liverpool are comparable this season
7/11/23, 11:48 pm - Dave: Think spurs will drop off, they’ve got a ton of injuries/match bans now and Ange tactics were questionable yesterday <This message was edited>
7/11/23, 11:49 pm - Jono: I think Spurs can recover from injuries and still go hard. They’re pretty solid and remind me of us in 2013/14
7/11/23, 11:49 pm - James: @61409710717 look at him sucking your mate off now
7/11/23, 11:49 pm - James: You were right about the suck up thing
7/11/23, 11:50 pm - Dave: Some serious anger in you this afternoon
7/11/23, 11:50 pm - Gerrard: And homophobia
7/11/23, 11:50 pm - James: Look at this distraction
7/11/23, 11:50 pm - Jono: It’s really bad hey. Can’t just chat normally here
7/11/23, 11:51 pm - James: I never said anything anti gay
7/11/23, 11:56 pm - Gerrard: This felt like an implication that sucking dick was a bad thing
7/11/23, 11:57 pm - James: Sucking off as a distraction and to get people on side
7/11/23, 11:57 pm - James: It's manipulation
8/11/23, 12:04 am - Dave: If I have an opinion about another team, I’m a homophobic slur? 🤨
8/11/23, 12:05 am - Dave: I don’t think commenting that the team with the same points and GD as us is on a similar level this season is that groundbreaking
8/11/23, 12:08 am - James: Gez says you're shit though so that would make Varpool what?
8/11/23, 12:08 am - James: What slur?
8/11/23, 12:23 am - Gerrard: Title contenders innit
8/11/23, 12:24 am - Gerrard: Pick any, you've said it in this group chat
8/11/23, 12:29 am - James: Title contenders who's biggest result so far this season was beating Newcastle? Lol
8/11/23, 12:29 am - James: Imagine saying that two years ago 😂
8/11/23, 12:42 am - James: Agree 9 players out. Did our best. Top manager. No crying. No blame. No statements.
8/11/23, 12:45 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 the king of spin, 3pts off top is a nice place to be, no one thinks of Newy apart from slinging shit at you when you're upset
8/11/23, 12:47 am - James: Yeah but who ya played?
8/11/23, 12:48 am - James: And your best result was against us sooooooo 😭 <This message was edited>
8/11/23, 12:52 am - Gerrard: No chance, beating Newy ain't no achievement
8/11/23, 12:53 am - Gerrard: I say the West Ham victory meant more, and those other 2nd half comebacks were noice
8/11/23, 12:54 am - James: Do better
8/11/23, 12:54 am - Gerrard: Bro I told you, no one gives a shit about Newy outside of Newty
8/11/23, 12:54 am - James: You're good with the Varsenal stuff
8/11/23, 12:54 am - Gerrard: But that's ok
8/11/23, 12:54 am - Gerrard: You do you bro
8/11/23, 12:55 am - Gerrard: Love the top half times
8/11/23, 12:55 am - Gerrard: Stop comparing to others
8/11/23, 12:55 am - Gerrard: Just live laugh and love bruva
8/11/23, 12:57 am - James: So dissatisfied with you right now
8/11/23, 12:58 am - James: That makes me feel better
8/11/23, 1:14 am - Gerrard: I've changed my opinion now, I was hoping Newty finish last but now I want them in Europa.
To see Jimmy's reaction to them getting knocked out of Europa.
8/11/23, 1:17 am - James: Get a life mate
8/11/23, 1:18 am - Gerrard: 🪇
8/11/23, 1:20 am - James: Find Jesus
8/11/23, 2:31 am - Liam: Humbled
8/11/23, 2:43 am - James: They're a much better team than Arsenal ❤️
8/11/23, 3:06 am - Gerrard: Zero chance of Newty ever feeling humble
8/11/23, 3:09 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/9Z0yjyfVXTc?si=-N3kQsTaSTmOdnsW
8/11/23, 3:09 am - James: Thinking Varpool had the biggest humbling not being able to beat an English airport no?
8/11/23, 3:16 am - Gerrard: Arsenal missing their best player
Vs
Liverpool having a bad day in front of goal
Vs 
Newy being shown they don't belong in Europe
8/11/23, 3:16 am - Gerrard: 🤷🏼‍♂️
8/11/23, 3:17 am - Jono: And we still gained a spot on the ladder - 4th > 3rd
8/11/23, 3:19 am - James: Want to see how you do with 8 of your team out
8/11/23, 3:19 am - James: You crumble like Varsenal if just one or two go missing
8/11/23, 3:19 am - Jono: It's happened before - we finished top 4
8/11/23, 3:19 am - Gerrard: You've seen it in 2021, 4th spot mate
8/11/23, 3:19 am - James: Wasn't that your title defence season
8/11/23, 3:19 am - Jono: 20/21
8/11/23, 3:19 am - James: Really really bad defence
8/11/23, 3:20 am - Jono: At least we got to defend something
8/11/23, 3:20 am - Gerrard: Finished 4th
8/11/23, 3:20 am - James: And Alisson had to score to get you fourth
8/11/23, 3:20 am - James: Lols
8/11/23, 3:20 am - James: 30 years in the prem with one title
8/11/23, 3:20 am - James: During a pandemic
8/11/23, 3:20 am - James: Well done guys
8/11/23, 3:20 am - Jono: Whatever it takes - You have a disabled Paraguayan scoring most of your goals last season
8/11/23, 3:20 am - James: Gold star for Varpool
8/11/23, 3:20 am - Gerrard: Spin King distracting that Newy don't belong in Europe
8/11/23, 3:22 am - Gerrard: Spin King starting to make Arteta look calm and reasonable
8/11/23, 3:22 am - Gerrard: Embarassing
8/11/23, 3:23 am - James: Is it true Varpool have finished outside the top four more times than inside the top four since the premier leagues inception? <This message was edited>
8/11/23, 3:24 am - James: Pft, Blackburn and Leicester did it better at a fraction of the cost
8/11/23, 3:32 am - Gerrard: Talk about living the past 🤣🤣🤣 
Spin King has completely lost it, grasping at straws - what about the Moore family mate, what about the amount Liverpool spend in the 70s, what about pandemic league?
8/11/23, 3:33 am - Jono: Could go back to past atrocities like Newcastle blowing a 12 point lead
8/11/23, 3:37 am - James: No different then going on about trophies Varpool won 60 years ago 😂
8/11/23, 3:37 am - Gerrard: Oh my gawd, you're so rattled
8/11/23, 3:37 am - James: Or Varpool fans killing other fans and each other and getting euro teams banned from europe
8/11/23, 3:37 am - James: Classy club 👌
8/11/23, 3:38 am - James: OMG your banter sucks ass today
8/11/23, 3:41 am - Gerrard: Classy banter
8/11/23, 3:41 am - James: Not banter
8/11/23, 3:42 am - Liam: I heard Joelinton missed a sitter (not banter)
8/11/23, 3:44 am - Jono: Big time. Crucial stage too. Dortmund scored straight after (their 2nd)
8/11/23, 3:44 am - Jono: Again, not bantz
8/11/23, 3:45 am - James: Willock also had the ball and got pulled back for it going out of play. Replays showed it didn't. From the throw in, Dortmund scored.
8/11/23, 3:45 am - James: Em - barrassing
8/11/23, 3:46 am - Liam: Joelinton needs upgrading hey?
8/11/23, 3:46 am - Liam: Replay?
8/11/23, 3:47 am - James: As much as Gabriel <This message was edited>
8/11/23, 3:47 am - James: Statement first
8/11/23, 3:49 am - Liam: Ya I heard howe’s tactics were naive during the crucial stage in the game. Doesn’t know how to play in these top games.
8/11/23, 3:50 am - Jono: I don’t blame him tbh he had to go for it. Draw probably would still fuck em
8/11/23, 3:50 am - Jono: given they have PSG away next
8/11/23, 3:50 am - Jono: Their saving grace was Milan beating PSG today
8/11/23, 3:50 am - Jono: Keeps them in it
8/11/23, 3:53 am - Liam: Ya youre right newy are lucky… and they are still rock bottom of their group.
8/11/23, 4:49 am - Gerrard: Chucked a Nunez
8/11/23, 4:49 am - Gerrard: Arteta's here lads
8/11/23, 4:50 am - Gerrard: Like Ange, out of their depth by they'll learn over time, hopefully they get time eh
8/11/23, 4:50 am - Gerrard: *depth but
8/11/23, 4:52 am - Gerrard: At least if they go out it'll prevent Jimmy from having to buy a ticket and travel across the world just to watch them lose again
8/11/23, 4:58 am - James: Shit banter
8/11/23, 4:59 am - James: Best bants was on the weekend when Jez asked are Varpool back if they beat Luton Town.. <This message was edited>
8/11/23, 5:32 am - Gerrard: Crickets lol
8/11/23, 5:33 am - Gerrard: Gone full Arteta
8/11/23, 5:33 am - Gerrard: Never go full Arteta
8/11/23, 5:33 am - Dave: Only used to managing relegation battlers. Big Sam 2.0
8/11/23, 7:09 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/Tfs9CoycsR8?si=1GnE1Zm6v9o6wB0A
8/11/23, 8:56 am - James: Too many injuries. Big Joe scores that header it's a different story. No complaints. Non Arteta-ing
8/11/23, 8:57 am - Gerrard: I can see you're trying really hard to not Arteta, I applaud your effort
8/11/23, 8:57 am - James: Just a man in Australia mate

8/11/23, 8:27 pm - James: Rooney apparently
8/11/23, 8:56 pm - James: https://youtube.com/shorts/lhc7glkXjWc?feature=shared
8/11/23, 9:57 pm - James: Manure went 2 up then sweet Marcus was sent off
8/11/23, 9:57 pm - James: 2-2 atm
8/11/23, 10:01 pm - Dave: Lol
8/11/23, 10:01 pm - Dave: I’ve got United to lose in my acca so 🤞
8/11/23, 10:16 pm - Louie: Even the UEFA refs haven’t forgiven us for the Wolves game
8/11/23, 10:40 pm - Louie: Jokes UEFA refs are cool
8/11/23, 10:44 pm - Jono: This ref is such a cuck
8/11/23, 10:55 pm - Jono: Haha goldbridge going off
8/11/23, 10:55 pm - Jono: “How is that a corner! Watch them score here” 

And they do
8/11/23, 10:57 pm - Louie: Carra talks sense
8/11/23, 11:00 pm - Jono: Haha
8/11/23, 11:00 pm - Dave: How it stands. All the big clubs topping the groups, no upsets
8/11/23, 11:00 pm - Jono: Goldbridge live was a great choice
8/11/23, 11:00 pm - Jono: 4-3
8/11/23, 11:01 pm - Dave: Wow, 4-3 😂
8/11/23, 11:08 pm - Louie: Hopefully we’ll see you all in Europa
8/11/23, 11:08 pm - Dave: I won my acca. Thanks United 🙏 Ten hag out @61413646755?
8/11/23, 11:09 pm - Louie: Nah that game was on red card decision
8/11/23, 11:09 pm - Louie: United looked good before that
8/11/23, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/IZqYu95K3-E?si=TluA9MqEM60Djc7e
8/11/23, 11:15 pm - James: Is he a manure fan
8/11/23, 11:15 pm - James: I don't think he is
8/11/23, 11:15 pm - James: Just acting
8/11/23, 11:16 pm - James: Never goes to games
8/11/23, 11:16 pm - Jono: I still enjoy watching him whinge
8/11/23, 11:16 pm - Jono: Happy to have the illusion that he is a Manc
8/11/23, 11:16 pm - Jono: As most Manc fans i know have hidden in a cave
8/11/23, 11:17 pm - Jono: The same one i was in last year
8/11/23, 11:17 pm - James: He does. Like when big Joe made Gabriel his bitch <This message was edited>
8/11/23, 11:18 pm - James: Alright in there isn't it. I spent 15 years. Comfy and safe
8/11/23, 11:19 pm - Louie: Hopefully us United fans don’t have to stay there for that long.
8/11/23, 11:19 pm - Louie: Otherwise gives us that Qatari oil money
8/11/23, 11:20 pm - James: If that happens, the other clubs will lobby for new rules to stop you
8/11/23, 11:21 pm - James: Spurs, Varpool and Varsenal mainly
8/11/23, 11:27 pm - Dave: Go back there now you’re in the bin at the bottom of the group
8/11/23, 11:28 pm - James: Where everyone thought we'd be but only three points off top, which people didn't think we'd be?
8/11/23, 11:28 pm - James: Varsenal got a Europa group lol. Dunno what's easier, that group or the one Varpool are in
8/11/23, 11:58 pm - Louie: I don’t know how. We’ve looked dog shit all season.
9/11/23, 12:00 am - James: Arsenal and Liverpool just aren't as amazing as their fans make them out to be
9/11/23, 12:14 am - Dave: It’s the taking part that counts hey ⚫️ ⚪️
9/11/23, 12:14 am - James: Like being Christmas champs! 💩
9/11/23, 12:15 am - Dave: “We were only 5 points off the top of the league last season”
9/11/23, 12:23 am - Louie: No loyalty, at least Larsson missed a penalty last game.
9/11/23, 12:50 am - Jono: PGMOL would’ve looked about 48 times and cleared it without doubt
9/11/23, 1:06 am - Jono: https://x.com/stokeyyg2/status/1722392146131537921?s=48

9/11/23, 4:25 am - Liam: Let it go.
9/11/23, 4:26 am - James: Not holding on to anything? Except those three points?
9/11/23, 5:07 am - Liam: Whatever table you look at you need more than those 3 points. Very disappointing season for newy so far.
9/11/23, 5:16 am - James: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CzNIY6-IiBO/?igshid=YWwxdjc2Y2x5dWtj
9/11/23, 5:17 am - Dave: Right. A gift from the PGMOL gods isn’t going to secure top 4 🥶
9/11/23, 5:19 am - James: We have more points than we did same stage last season and QF of one of the cups. What is you talking about? Why are you guys so weird?
9/11/23, 5:19 am - James: Varsenal on the other hand, faaaar worse than last season so far
9/11/23, 5:20 am - James: Oh and we've beat you, Manure, PSG and Citeh. You got a deflected winner against an understrength citeh. What else you done? <This message was edited>
9/11/23, 5:21 am - Dave: Yeah, there were only two teams in the league last season though. Hence you getting found out this season. More competitive
9/11/23, 5:21 am - James: Nah. I'd say Varsenal been found out
9/11/23, 5:21 am - Dave: And Europe thrown you in the bin.
9/11/23, 5:21 am - James: Watching you knock the ball from one wing to the other at the weekend was hilarious 😂😂😂
9/11/23, 5:22 am - James: What a title charge so far...
9/11/23, 5:22 am - James: 🍶
9/11/23, 5:22 am - Dave: Top of our UCL group and joint third in league after playing every big club apart from Liverpool. Don’t think things are that bad
9/11/23, 5:23 am - James: Top of your Europa League UCL group. Failed to beat us. Failed to beat spurs. Lucky versus manure, lucky versus citeh. You played Brighton and Villa yet? <This message was edited>
9/11/23, 5:23 am - James: Or Varpool?
9/11/23, 5:25 am - James: Or Brentford?
9/11/23, 5:25 am - James: Disss graaace 💩
9/11/23, 5:27 am - Dave: Look inwards mate, half your squad is out

9/11/23, 5:28 am - James: Shite 😴😴😴
9/11/23, 5:33 am - Liam: Rock bottom of your cl group
9/11/23, 5:34 am - Liam: 2 points above United in the pl
9/11/23, 5:34 am - Liam: Pathetic season
9/11/23, 5:34 am - James: You're only two wins above a terrible man yooou
9/11/23, 5:35 am - James: And you have lots of hard games you still haven't played unlike them
9/11/23, 5:35 am - James: Soon be turning on cryteta
9/11/23, 5:43 am - Dave: Talk about throwing stones in glass houses 👀
9/11/23, 5:44 am - Dave: Never. Wouldn’t have any other manager ❤️
9/11/23, 5:46 am - Gerrard: Too many messages.
Is Rodders still talking about VAR or is Jimmy still raging at everyone over the CL result?
9/11/23, 5:48 am - Dave: Haven’t mentioned VAR today. Moved on after another fantastic result in champions league
9/11/23, 5:51 am - Gerrard: Growth
9/11/23, 5:58 am - James: Still thinks the ball was out
9/11/23, 5:58 am - Gerrard: No growth yet
9/11/23, 6:00 am - James: @61409710717 all I did was post the arteta vs howe vid you sent me and it set him off. Even Liam made an appearance
9/11/23, 6:00 am - Dave: Over it. In past now. Time to move on
9/11/23, 6:01 am - James: @61409710717 I think anything arteta related is quite triggering
9/11/23, 6:01 am - Dave: Competing in too many comps to worry about the past
9/11/23, 6:01 am - Gerrard: Has Arteta faced the media again?
9/11/23, 6:01 am - Dave: Newcastle will probably win the league @61452662705 now they’re dumped out of Europe?
9/11/23, 6:01 am - James: @61409710717 he keeps going on about Newcastle now
9/11/23, 6:02 am - James: I can't help him
9/11/23, 6:02 am - Gerrard: ......so many rattles in here
9/11/23, 6:02 am - Gerrard: It's like a WW1 hospital ward
9/11/23, 6:02 am - James: Same chance as you. 0
9/11/23, 6:02 am - James: But you weird gooners won't accept it
9/11/23, 6:03 am - Gerrard: Facts
9/11/23, 6:03 am - James: 0. Like 0 points. Like last Saturday. 0
9/11/23, 6:04 am - Dave: We’re not winning the league lol
9/11/23, 6:04 am - James: @61409710717 what's sad is they'll probably beat Burnley and then it'll be 'we're back' all over again
9/11/23, 6:04 am - Dave: Who said that
9/11/23, 6:04 am - Dave: We’re competing with Liverpool and spurs for second
9/11/23, 6:04 am - Dave: That’s it
9/11/23, 6:05 am - Dave: Know your place
9/11/23, 6:05 am - Gerrard: I don't believe Livo have a chance on the league but they have more chance than Arsenal
9/11/23, 6:05 am - Gerrard: For plenty of reasons
9/11/23, 6:05 am - James: Do tell
9/11/23, 6:05 am - Gerrard: But no.1 reason.....
9/11/23, 6:05 am - James: They're not arsenal?
9/11/23, 6:06 am - Gerrard: They have a grown adult as a manager
9/11/23, 6:06 am - Gerrard: Not a little cry baby
9/11/23, 6:06 am - Gerrard: Who celebrates mid season games like they're cup finals
9/11/23, 6:07 am - James: Disss greacceee
9/11/23, 6:07 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 too much?
9/11/23, 6:07 am - Dave: Is this coming from one of the fist pumpers “the grass was wet” loyal minions? Fuck me I’ve heard it all now
9/11/23, 6:07 am - James: Tell the truth brother 🙌
9/11/23, 6:07 am - Gerrard: I came in late today so thought better catch up
9/11/23, 6:07 am - James: He's typing now
9/11/23, 6:07 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 feel like I got him
9/11/23, 6:08 am - Dave: Watched him do a quadruple fist pump at Luton
9/11/23, 6:08 am - Dave: Oh you got me there
9/11/23, 6:08 am - James: Since moving to the states he's lost his mojo
9/11/23, 6:08 am - Gerrard: Facts, neutered
9/11/23, 6:08 am - James: Hanging out with pussified Californianians
9/11/23, 6:08 am - Dave: Pot and kettle
9/11/23, 6:09 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 reason no.2
9/11/23, 6:09 am - James: @14244893404 you wouldn't last a day working with me now
9/11/23, 6:09 am - James: Admit it
9/11/23, 6:09 am - James: I took you to the edge two years ago
9/11/23, 6:09 am - Dave: In what capacity?
9/11/23, 6:09 am - James: Sorry, please continue
9/11/23, 6:10 am - Gerrard: The fans back the manager and the players in good times and bad
9/11/23, 6:10 am - Dave: Oh yeah you were a total cunt. Are you worse nowadays? Surprised you’re employed if you are
9/11/23, 6:11 am - James: Well shit, I meant by how hard I worked but you go and call me a cunt?
9/11/23, 6:11 am - James: @61409710717 why is he like this?
9/11/23, 6:13 am - Dave: So hard that the company spent tens of thousands on outsourced HR department to handle difficult employees?
9/11/23, 6:13 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 reason no.3
9/11/23, 6:14 am - James: How good was that 😁
9/11/23, 6:14 am - James: Yes mate
9/11/23, 6:14 am - James: 🫠
9/11/23, 6:15 am - Gerrard: Liverpool has players who show up in big games
9/11/23, 6:15 am - Dave: Broke the unbreakable 😂😂😂
9/11/23, 6:19 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 reason no.4
9/11/23, 8:09 am - James: 🧐
9/11/23, 8:15 am - Gerrard: In the 5 years, 
Liverpool's pedigree has been winning trophies most seasons.
Arsenal's pedigree has been bottling every season.
9/11/23, 8:15 am - Gerrard: *last 5 years
9/11/23, 8:26 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 this new gentleman Liam is such a beauty, backing me up on my points 🥰
9/11/23, 8:28 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 I didn't realise that previous bad season we were still 3rd, I remember it being 4th lol
9/11/23, 8:31 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 reason no.5 or give some time to digest?
9/11/23, 8:31 am - James: Don't leave me hanging bro
9/11/23, 8:31 am - James: Won't be able to sleep tonight
9/11/23, 8:31 am - Gerrard: Diogo Jota > Gabriel Jesus
9/11/23, 8:35 am - James: @61409710717 I saw a clip of aftv saying they were glad they were out of the  carabou cup so they can concentrate on winning the PL and UCL.

Isn't that weird!?
9/11/23, 8:36 am - Gerrard: Wasn't that what they said last season after going out of each cup and Europa?
9/11/23, 8:36 am - James: Their recent history suggests they're not exactly a club who can be picky about what they win
9/11/23, 8:36 am - James: Yeah lol
9/11/23, 8:37 am - Gerrard: Even if you're Man City, pretty sure you want to win every trophy you can.
Is it different for Arsenal?
9/11/23, 8:37 am - James: They went out of carabou and FA Cup first leg
9/11/23, 8:37 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 reason no.6
9/11/23, 8:37 am - James: But still thought they were as good as citeh
9/11/23, 8:38 am - Jono: Yeah we overtook Chelsea too from memory
9/11/23, 8:38 am - Gerrard: Arsenal's attitude to cup tournaments
9/11/23, 8:45 am - Gerrard: I'm going to lend out my reason no.7 on 'why Liverpool have a better chance than Arsenal' to my good friend in honour of a great no.7, the biter Luis Suarez.
@61404060785 reason no.7?
9/11/23, 9:03 am - Jono: We have a much better goalkeeper
9/11/23, 9:03 am - Jono: Than both Raya and Ramy put together
9/11/23, 9:16 am - Dave: Ok I’ll bite. 

3 Liverpool players at best get into the Arsenal squad. Smaller pool of talent. Aging squad with no sign of investment from owners to replace. You have a world class manager holding the club together with Band-Aid’s and growing tired of the lack of backing - he’ll walk soon enough, he has nothing left to win there. You’re a shell of the side you were in ~2019 and probably won’t win anything major for another 30 years 💅
9/11/23, 9:25 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
9/11/23, 9:32 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 reason no.8?
9/11/23, 9:33 am - James: Aftv
9/11/23, 9:40 am - Liam: Award winning content
9/11/23, 9:41 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
9/11/23, 9:44 am - James: Did arsenal release any statements about the racist abuse from their fans on Saturday?
9/11/23, 9:45 am - Gerrard: Holy shit what happened???
9/11/23, 9:46 am - James: They attacked Joe Willock. One of their own. Standard.
9/11/23, 9:46 am - Gerrard: Reason no.9
9/11/23, 9:47 am - Gerrard: Liverpool don't racially abuse their explayers
9/11/23, 9:51 am - James: Sad thing is he is an Arsenal boy. Came up through their academy
9/11/23, 9:52 am - Jono: They even turned their spiritual home into fucking apartments
9/11/23, 9:54 am - James: Yeah saw it on the train to London in February. Sad
9/11/23, 9:55 am - James: The only identity they kept was bottling I guess?
9/11/23, 9:56 am - Jono: Piers fucking Morgan
9/11/23, 9:56 am - Jono: Supports them
9/11/23, 9:56 am - Jono: Enough said really
9/11/23, 9:57 am - Jono: And the fucking Queen
9/11/23, 9:57 am - Jono: Yes, I went there
9/11/23, 9:58 am - Jono: Fidel Castro too apparently… randomly
9/11/23, 9:58 am - James: Yeah that'll do it
9/11/23, 9:58 am - Dave: Queen was a hammer
9/11/23, 9:59 am - Dave: Wish we could claim her
9/11/23, 9:59 am - Jono: I googled and she came up. As did Haz
9/11/23, 10:01 am - Gerrard: Reason no.10
9/11/23, 10:01 am - Gerrard: Reason no.11
9/11/23, 10:02 am - James: Their two legends, Henry and Wright are black yet they racially abuse Willock?
9/11/23, 10:02 am - James: Or have we got racists already
9/11/23, 10:03 am - James: That purple kit... Reason 12
9/11/23, 10:03 am - James: Or the gold trim on this seasons
9/11/23, 10:03 am - Gerrard: Reason no.12
9/11/23, 10:03 am - Jono: Reason 13. Claiming invincibility through 13 draws
9/11/23, 10:03 am - James: Because they thought they'd won the league in march
9/11/23, 10:04 am - Gerrard: And getting done in the cups.
Reason no.13!
9/11/23, 10:04 am - James: They're not the best ever prem team
9/11/23, 10:04 am - James: It's so weird they think that
9/11/23, 10:04 am - James: It means nothing
9/11/23, 10:05 am - James: Points win prizes
9/11/23, 10:05 am - Gerrard: Not top 5
9/11/23, 10:05 am - James: Sol Campbell
9/11/23, 10:05 am - James: Reason 14
9/11/23, 10:05 am - Jono: Reason 15. Seaman
9/11/23, 10:07 am - James: Robert Pires facial hair that looked like he got gravy down his chin
9/11/23, 10:07 am - James: Reason 16
9/11/23, 10:08 am - Gerrard: Reason no.17.......
9/11/23, 10:09 am - Gerrard: Signing Chelsea and Tottenham players once they're past their prime.
9/11/23, 10:11 am - James: Francis Jeffers
9/11/23, 10:12 am - James: Reason 18
9/11/23, 10:16 am - Jono: Hate to break it to ya @61409710717
9/11/23, 10:16 am - Jono: Danny DeVito
9/11/23, 10:16 am - Jono: Arsenal fan
9/11/23, 10:17 am - Gerrard: Little man like Arteta
9/11/23, 10:18 am - Gerrard: Reason no.19.....
9/11/23, 10:18 am - Gerrard: Edu is their sporting director.
9/11/23, 10:19 am - James: They're fucking shit

9/11/23, 8:19 pm - James: Toulouse 😂😂😂
9/11/23, 8:20 pm - Liam: What’s that?
9/11/23, 8:23 pm - James: Fuck it was only 1-0 at HT, kloppy panicked and made it worse!
9/11/23, 8:25 pm - Liam: Shame they just scored again
9/11/23, 8:29 pm - James: They had to score an OG to help them out
9/11/23, 8:29 pm - James: First Luton now this 🫠
9/11/23, 8:34 pm - Dave: Oh my god 😂😂😂😂😂
9/11/23, 8:35 pm - Dave: The big guns are on and they’re getting dicked. 

Is this reason number 27 why liverpool are better than arsenal @61409710717 ?
9/11/23, 8:42 pm - Jono: And I thought I was the only one who does jinxing
9/11/23, 8:44 pm - Jono: Haha 3rd goal disallowed 

I’ll claim that 🤣
9/11/23, 8:44 pm - Jono: Not watching so no idea what was going on
9/11/23, 8:47 pm - James: Varpool are 'back' @14244893404? 😂
9/11/23, 8:57 pm - Dave: It’s all gone downhill ever since @61409710717 made that outrageous claim. Solely responsible for liverpool returning to the steaming pile of shit they were last season
9/11/23, 8:59 pm - Dave: https://x.com/utdfaithfuls/status/1722690162390335665?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA

9/11/23, 9:29 pm - James: Brentford
9/11/23, 9:29 pm - Dave: Ouch
9/11/23, 9:29 pm - Gerrard: Are Brentford farmers?
9/11/23, 9:29 pm - Dave: City following week
9/11/23, 9:29 pm - Gerrard: Oh thanks god, no more farmers
9/11/23, 9:30 pm - James: I thought they were going to be top?
9/11/23, 9:30 pm - Dave: Going to get my suit dry cleaned for Liverpools downfall. Didn’t even have a run until Christmas this year

9/11/23, 9:30 pm - James: I heard they were back?
9/11/23, 9:30 pm - Gerrard: Reason no.21
9/11/23, 9:30 pm - Dave: Back in the gutter

9/11/23, 9:31 pm - Gerrard: He's got a point
9/11/23, 9:31 pm - James: What's that about
9/11/23, 9:31 pm - Dave: We’re not the same. Levels to this game
9/11/23, 9:32 pm - James: Hey, tbf, you both lost to shite French teams this season?
9/11/23, 9:32 pm - Gerrard: Ooooooo that shook you out of your run this morning
9/11/23, 9:33 pm - Gerrard: Goal for 3-3 disallowed by VAR
9/11/23, 9:33 pm - James: Wrong date and wrong hashtag

9/11/23, 9:42 pm - James: Their group is tasty now. Might go out lol
9/11/23, 9:42 pm - Gerrard: Not really, what they say about him?
His work got us the 2nd goal and should've again for the non 3rd
9/11/23, 9:42 pm - Gerrard: Check before you talk
9/11/23, 9:43 pm - James: Did you actually check your group this morning 😭😂
9/11/23, 9:43 pm - Gerrard: Yeah
9/11/23, 9:43 pm - Gerrard: Why
9/11/23, 9:44 pm - James: Oh no I hope that defeat doesn't damage our chances of progression out of a group full of teams nobody has heard of
9/11/23, 9:44 pm - Gerrard: 3rd place is on 4pts and we on 9pts with two games left?
9/11/23, 9:45 pm - Gerrard: Top of the group innit
9/11/23, 9:45 pm - James: No idea. Don't know
9/11/23, 9:45 pm - Gerrard: If we get in trouble, Kloppster will start the first team
9/11/23, 9:46 pm - James: The Kloppinator
9/11/23, 9:46 pm - Gerrard: No need to worry Jimmy, it's all gonna be ok
9/11/23, 9:46 pm - Gerrard: Reason no.22
9/11/23, 9:47 pm - Gerrard: Arsenal fans panic and flip flop their faith in the team game to game.
9/11/23, 9:48 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 I'm about to meet a client who's a Liverpool fan and an Ange fan....
9/11/23, 9:48 pm - Dave: Did you see the panic attack subs klopp brought on today? He had a mental breakdown on the sideline
9/11/23, 9:49 pm - Gerrard: What a disgrace
9/11/23, 10:07 pm - James: Klopp going livid at the officials
9/11/23, 10:07 pm - James: Come on mate
9/11/23, 10:07 pm - James: Your team let in 3
9/11/23, 10:10 pm - Gerrard: Gave the ball away stupidly in all 3
9/11/23, 10:11 pm - James: Why was the second Toulouse goal disallowed?
9/11/23, 10:13 pm - Gerrard: Only saw the goals and the non 3rd Livo one

10/11/23, 2:19 am - James: I expect arteta to be heavily fined now and or touchline ban!?
10/11/23, 2:19 am - Gerrard: 100% and he's really trying to get me to respond to him about Livo as a distraction. So far failing.
10/11/23, 2:19 am - Liam: @61452662705 Are you coming to Meredith?
10/11/23, 2:45 am - Dave: No one cares about the dodgy goal anymore
10/11/23, 2:45 am - Dave: The hot topic is Karen Klopp’s meltdown today. Storming the pitch to abuse the refs, shouting at the journalists in the post match interviews
10/11/23, 3:20 am - James: Footage?
10/11/23, 3:20 am - James: Unclear
10/11/23, 3:40 am - Pero: Hahahahhaa this is hilarious , hear the French fans and kloppy fuming
10/11/23, 4:06 am - James: Hilarious
10/11/23, 4:35 am - Pero: Looks like it hit his arm and a handball
10/11/23, 4:45 am - Gerrard: Better hurry gonna sell the ticket
10/11/23, 4:46 am - Gerrard: Excuse me?

Reason no.27.....
10/11/23, 4:46 am - Gerrard: Arsenal fans have Arsenal soft toys and merch on display around there house
10/11/23, 5:05 am - Pero: Just commenting on the photo it clearly shows it hit his arm. But I didn't watch the game or lead up to it
10/11/23, 5:09 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/heTMlxdiYH8?si=RI9O4FUtH__vOq1h
@61452662705 
All these explayers pundits missing the point about refs, saying they've never played, get explayers in to be refs, etc.
The refs are mostly enforcing the letter of the law - not the "he didn't mean it", "no intent" - it's the law changes that are fucking up the games.
Change the law.
10/11/23, 5:09 am - Gerrard: But also EPL are sub par
10/11/23, 5:09 am - Gerrard: *EPL refs
10/11/23, 5:12 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/suAR1PYFNYA?si=OpLQSV5NbPMt7Urd
For @61404060785 and @61452662705
10/11/23, 5:20 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 just watched the Klopp post match interview, afterwards had to change a contact in my phone
10/11/23, 5:30 am - Pero: This panel decision is just making the recent var debacles even worse. By their statement it would be ok for an attacker to fly kick a defender in the back after the defender commenced to play the ball. Doesn't make sense. Panel just sticking up for ref's.

Agreed @61409710717 the law is shite. Just because its 'contact' in the box shouldn't automatically mean it's a pen
10/11/23, 5:31 am - Pero: So many soft pens in the past just for 'contact'
10/11/23, 5:54 am - James: Arteta should be fined though
10/11/23, 5:55 am - James: Touchline ban too
10/11/23, 5:57 am - Gerrard: At least for the waving arms behaviour
10/11/23, 5:58 am - James: I thought the var was excellent in regard to the goal 👌
10/11/23, 6:09 am - Gerrard: Reason no.28 @61452662705
10/11/23, 6:12 am - Gerrard: Awks hand holding
10/11/23, 6:14 am - James: If he can't be bothered to learn how to draw hands why should the players be bothered to do anything
10/11/23, 6:15 am - James: The proportions are all wrong too
10/11/23, 6:15 am - Gerrard: Maybe if they bought another dog called "Hand Holding" they'd get better at it.
10/11/23, 6:15 am - James: Maybe those 'hands' are actually paws
10/11/23, 6:15 am - James: The human in the back looks like he has bear paws
10/11/23, 6:16 am - Gerrard: Reason no.29
10/11/23, 6:28 am - Pero: Entire dog pound will be needed at Anfield lately
10/11/23, 6:44 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I'll engage with Pero because I respect him.
10/11/23, 6:45 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 what was Arsenal's last loss?
10/11/23, 6:45 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I know Liverpool's loss there was a bit unfair.
10/11/23, 6:52 am - Dave: https://x.com/eurofootcom/status/1722723845725946192?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
10/11/23, 6:52 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 is 6 more than 5?
10/11/23, 6:53 am - Gerrard: Reason no.30

10/11/23, 9:02 am - James: @61413646755?
10/11/23, 9:02 am - James: That's a lie?
10/11/23, 9:03 am - James: Not dogy though?
10/11/23, 9:04 am - Gerrard: Nah it's just Arsenal facts
10/11/23, 9:09 am - James: Eddie Howe?
10/11/23, 9:10 am - Gerrard: You mean when VAR didn't have a communications fuck up and applied the rules of the game correctly?
10/11/23, 9:10 am - James: How is 2 goals and 3 assists more than 4 goals and 2 assists?
10/11/23, 9:12 am - Gerrard: Nah it's Arsenal math
10/11/23, 9:13 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 9:15 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 did you glaring exclusion there???
Fucking Mancs
10/11/23, 9:15 am - Gerrard: *did you see
10/11/23, 9:15 am - James: Dunno if I know
10/11/23, 9:16 am - James: Eloborate
10/11/23, 9:16 am - Gerrard: Klopp's 4th season: 2nd and....
10/11/23, 9:18 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 9:19 am - Gerrard: Mancs almost as delusional as Arsenal fans
10/11/23, 9:29 am - Jono: Gulp
10/11/23, 9:30 am - Jono: This was the only content worth reading after 8am today
10/11/23, 9:31 am - Gerrard: And your populace love for it will make you blow with one extra fact......
10/11/23, 9:31 am - Gerrard: Tame Impala produced it with her

10/11/23, 11:50 am - Louie: Damn, ETH peaked too early
10/11/23, 11:52 am - You updated the message timer. New messages will disappear from this chat 7 days after they're sent, except when kept.
10/11/23, 12:58 pm - Gerrard turned off disappearing messages.
11/11/23, 12:31 am - James: Who's turning messages off
11/11/23, 12:31 am - James: Can't delete the past
11/11/23, 12:50 am - James: Excellent
11/11/23, 12:51 am - Gerrard: Exactly

11/11/23, 1:38 am - James: Can't stop it. Can try though 😂
11/11/23, 1:38 am - James: So wild all these new rules made up in the last two seasons. Clubs must be worried ⚫⚪
11/11/23, 1:43 am - James: One last thing, haven't clubs like spurs, Varpool and Varsenal learned anything the last two years?
11/11/23, 1:45 am - James: So heavily concentrated on stopping Newcastle off the pitch, Varpool and spurs especially, have forgot to stop us on the pitch by picking up enough points 😂 two years in and already well ahead of schedule. Give it another two seasons and yall be really triggered then
11/11/23, 1:45 am - James: 🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦
11/11/23, 1:49 am - Gerrard: How indecent of them to try to stop cheating and dodgey collusion
11/11/23, 1:49 am - Gerrard: Free Saudi Arabia
11/11/23, 1:52 am - James: How is it? Lots of clubs loan to related party clubs?
11/11/23, 1:52 am - Gerrard: Free Saudi Arabia
11/11/23, 1:52 am - Gerrard: I'm on your side bro
11/11/23, 1:52 am - James: This won't work for one, and also, it's funny how this is a temporary message trying to be bought in before Jan to stop us 😂
11/11/23, 1:53 am - James: Smells of Daniel Levy, FSG and the bell who owns Villa
11/11/23, 1:53 am - Gerrard: I killed the temp messages, fucking Shaun did it for some reason
11/11/23, 1:53 am - James: Temp messages?
11/11/23, 1:53 am - Gerrard: All is as it was
11/11/23, 1:53 am - James: Dubbo who that is?
11/11/23, 1:53 am - James: *dunno
11/11/23, 1:54 am - James: Who's his team?
11/11/23, 1:54 am - Gerrard: The Human Beings
11/11/23, 4:12 am - Dave: When have arsenal “tried to stop you off the pitch”. We don’t give a shit about you. Only brokies like FSG and tight arses like levy that give a shit. Hence all the noise
11/11/23, 4:13 am - James: I said mainly Spurs and Varpool
11/11/23, 4:14 am - Dave: Varpool by default if you’re Aussie.
11/11/23, 7:14 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 what's Arteta Jr on about today?

11/11/23, 3:31 pm - Gerrard: 93mins of frustration then bliss
11/11/23, 3:40 pm - Gerrard: Wolves and Tottenham are both shit at football
11/11/23, 3:54 pm - Jono: Wolves first goal was fucking mint 🔥
11/11/23, 5:36 pm - Dave: Unbelievable goal from Zinny, that was class
11/11/23, 6:25 pm - James: Oh dear our line up 😂
11/11/23, 6:25 pm - James: Bare bones @14244893404
11/11/23, 6:25 pm - James: Gordon no. 9
11/11/23, 6:25 pm - James: Brilliant that
11/11/23, 6:26 pm - James: Keen to see how our 16 year old DM does today 😬
11/11/23, 6:28 pm - Dave: $20 on cherries at 4-1
11/11/23, 6:28 pm - Dave: Howe back at Dean court, it’s personal right?! 😂
11/11/23, 6:29 pm - James: I thought Wilson would make this one. 8 senior players out
11/11/23, 6:29 pm - James: I'll take a point 😂
11/11/23, 6:30 pm - James: I hate this green kit
11/11/23, 7:10 pm - Dave: That’ll be a good result for you
11/11/23, 7:10 pm - Dave: Cherries are dominant 😬
11/11/23, 7:16 pm - James: Of course they are. 2 suspended 10 injured 😂 Almiron now done his hammy
11/11/23, 7:53 pm - Dave: Awesome assist
11/11/23, 7:53 pm - Jono: Liverpool rejects doing gods work
11/11/23, 7:53 pm - Dave: Banger
11/11/23, 7:54 pm - Dave: Pope the statue. Raya would have been all over that
11/11/23, 7:54 pm - Jono: Not that I’m happy as I needed Newy to win to complete my overnight multi
11/11/23, 7:54 pm - Jono: Bournemouth are spastics generally
11/11/23, 7:54 pm - Dave: Luton ruined my multi, had them on double chance at United
11/11/23, 7:54 pm - Dave: That’s how little I think of United now
11/11/23, 7:55 pm - Jono: I had Wolves and Everton
11/11/23, 7:55 pm - Jono: Plus the other faves from overnight
11/11/23, 7:55 pm - Dave: Same. Plus arsenal and Luton double chance
11/11/23, 7:57 pm - James: This game is over
11/11/23, 7:58 pm - James: Who is parkinson
11/11/23, 7:58 pm - James: 😂
11/11/23, 8:02 pm - James: Longstaff now out
11/11/23, 8:02 pm - Dave: Jesus
11/11/23, 8:02 pm - Dave: Longstaff done as well
11/11/23, 8:03 pm - James: What the fuck is going on
11/11/23, 8:03 pm - Dave: Wheels just came off, that’s what happened
11/11/23, 8:03 pm - James: Add Longstaff
11/11/23, 8:05 pm - Dave: Super solanke brace, can’t believe I got 4-1
11/11/23, 9:00 pm - James: Congrats 😂
11/11/23, 9:00 pm - James: I don't think any team can compete with that many injuries. Citeh maybe
11/11/23, 9:01 pm - James: I blame Tonali

11/11/23, 10:35 pm - Jono: It’s all falling apart @61452662705
12/11/23, 12:12 am - Gerrard: Injuries are no excuse, I remember you said this in 2021 when Livo came 3rd
12/11/23, 12:12 am - Gerrard: What a tit
12/11/23, 12:15 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 can't believe Tripper was yelling 'How many injuries we got?!'
12/11/23, 12:16 am - Jono: He’s basically excused the side now
12/11/23, 12:17 am - Jono: By playing the injuries card
12/11/23, 12:46 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I just watched the 9 minutes highlights to treat myself
12/11/23, 12:57 am - Gerrard: Man, Bournemouth were peppering Saudi Arabia's goalie
12/11/23, 12:58 am - Jono: Complete domination
12/11/23, 12:58 am - Jono: This team isn’t worthy of Europa let alone UCL
12/11/23, 1:00 am - Gerrard: Gordon and Longstaff were poor
12/11/23, 1:01 am - Dave: Innit. Suck it up, you’re on 300k a week and the blokes you’re shouting at are paying it. 

And this whole “look how many injuries we’ve got”.. how do you think the rest of the squad feel? The ones that are finally getting their day in the sun and getting some game time are being slagged by a senior first teamer. Shame
12/11/23, 1:02 am - Gerrard: Is he their captain too?
12/11/23, 1:05 am - Gerrard: Poor captain behaviour
12/11/23, 1:05 am - Dave: Expect this kind of behaviour from Bruno Fernandes
12/11/23, 1:06 am - Gerrard: "not ourselves" or are they more themselves than ever before?
12/11/23, 1:06 am - Dave: Horrible team really aren’t they Newcastle
12/11/23, 1:06 am - Dave: Bruno the murderer. Bunch of chavs
12/11/23, 1:30 am - Gerrard: Arsenal players hate Jorginho too, so much they kicked him in the face
12/11/23, 1:59 am - Pero: Pope had a massive workout
12/11/23, 2:05 am - Jono: Not the first Pope to get a workout by a mouth
12/11/23, 3:20 am - James: Well done tripps ❤️
12/11/23, 3:22 am - James: Yes, however, you were saying Varpool were the best team in the world at that point?
12/11/23, 3:24 am - James: At any stage in that season, did you have the equivalent of Robinson, Gini, Henderson, Salah, Kane, Firmino, and whoever else was in your starting 11 out for a long set of fixtures at the same time? <This message was edited>
12/11/23, 3:25 am - James: Some good saves 👍
12/11/23, 3:31 am - James: No Laceslles is 😬
12/11/23, 3:31 am - James: Facts
12/11/23, 3:58 am - Dave: Last save of the match was awesome
12/11/23, 3:58 am - Dave: Lucky not to be 3 or 4
12/11/23, 4:09 am - James: Could be save of the season that one
12/11/23, 4:43 am - Gerrard: Fuck that's a lot of messages 🪇
12/11/23, 5:26 am - Liam: Ohhh newy 😢
12/11/23, 7:01 am - Liam: Oh god ☹️
12/11/23, 7:03 am - Liam: Pathetic
12/11/23, 7:04 am - Gerrard: Poor from both parties
12/11/23, 7:05 am - Liam: But somewhat expected
12/11/23, 7:37 am - Liam: United are above newy

@61452662705
12/11/23, 8:31 am - James: He says a lot of things doesn't he 🤷
12/11/23, 9:13 am - Liam: Bournemouth and luton had the same amount of points before the newy game.
12/11/23, 7:52 pm - Jono: “fAnS fInK”
12/11/23, 7:53 pm - Jono: Top 2 battle in two weeks for top spot
12/11/23, 7:54 pm - Jono: That’s what I’m worried about
12/11/23, 7:54 pm - Jono: Chelsea City - what a game
12/11/23, 8:09 pm - Dave: https://x.com/skysportspl/status/1723776404712489211?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
12/11/23, 8:14 pm - James: Varpool cheating again?
12/11/23, 8:15 pm - Dave: I hope Thomas Frank gets the same amount of abuse as Arteta and Klopp. How dare he speak out about bad decisions, disgraceful
12/11/23, 8:16 pm - James: Cheating at anfield again?
12/11/23, 8:33 pm - Dave: First real test you’ve had this season in the league
12/11/23, 9:09 pm - Liam: What a game!
12/11/23, 9:10 pm - Liam: I would love you to beat them!
12/11/23, 9:48 pm - Pero: Chel$ea should of won that , shit scrap goals from haaland again and deflections.  Hektik game
12/11/23, 9:56 pm - Dave: Same, someone needs to take points off them other than us and wolves 💪
12/11/23, 10:49 pm - Jono: Interesting to see Newy are  one loss away from being a mid table club again 🙏
12/11/23, 10:54 pm - Dave: https://x.com/ishan04shah/status/1723776680513175948?s=46&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
12/11/23, 10:55 pm - Jono: They’re all turning. Soon Eddie will call for Saudi refs to be called up
12/11/23, 10:55 pm - Dave: So that’s de zerbi, Thomas frank and poch all freaking out at the officials this weekend. Poch fing and blinding storming the ref at the end of the game. Let’s see if any of them even get 5% of the abuse Arteta for calling it out last weekend
12/11/23, 10:55 pm - James: Keep dreaming ⚫⚪🇸🇦
12/11/23, 10:55 pm - Dave: Or klopp. It’s only Arteta and Klopp that get the abuse for daring to complain
12/11/23, 10:56 pm - Jono: And watch Ange continue to respect the refs decision while Spurs join Newy somewhere in the middle
12/11/23, 10:56 pm - Dave: They’re all on oil money payroll because their cashies pay more than their 9-5
12/11/23, 10:57 pm - Dave: It’s all a facade. Thinks a bit of brown nosing will get him some brownie points
12/11/23, 10:57 pm - James: Somebody is loud this morning because they beat the mighty Brentford
12/11/23, 10:57 pm - James: Pretty quiet last week after scrapping a draw with the mighty Luton
12/11/23, 10:57 pm - Dave: “The refs are like coppers, I wouldn’t dare question them” 

Give it up you brown nosing cunt
12/11/23, 10:58 pm - James: Bunch of children
12/11/23, 10:59 pm - James: Was supposed to be automatic red cards
12/11/23, 11:03 pm - James: Because they act like brats throwing temper tantrums every week. Embarrassing
12/11/23, 11:04 pm - Dave: Like trippier verbally abusing the paying fans that travelled to the opposite end of the country to watch that pile of steaming shit yesterday?
12/11/23, 11:05 pm - James: Klippy gets rattled during post match press conferences these days
12/11/23, 11:05 pm - James: 'Verbally abusing'
12/11/23, 11:06 pm - James: *One fan
12/11/23, 11:33 pm - Dave: Poor lad posted a teary apology online. He said he was just upset because his train broke down and it cost him hundreds of pounds and all day to get to Bournemouth. Then his hero tore him down in front of the world
12/11/23, 11:34 pm - James: Least he goes to games 🤷
12/11/23, 11:53 pm - Dave: You should tell tripps that
13/11/23, 12:37 am - Gerrard: Lots of messages, Jimmy still rattled about losing to Rodders Bournemouth?
13/11/23, 12:37 am - Jono: He’s still mentioning Luton even though we didn’t lose
13/11/23, 12:38 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 how's the Spin King Jimmy turning Liverpool winning into something negative today?
13/11/23, 12:38 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 are Liverpool back yet?
13/11/23, 12:38 am - Jono: Endo should’ve been sent off even while we were 2 goals up
13/11/23, 12:38 am - Jono: Forgetting that we usually play better with 10 anyway
13/11/23, 12:38 am - Gerrard: Replay I saw was no studs, toes down
13/11/23, 12:39 am - Gerrard: Just two players challenging for the ball
13/11/23, 12:39 am - Jono: All I know is we’re on a massive decline despite going up 2 spots on the ladder during said decline
13/11/23, 12:39 am - Jono: 🙃
13/11/23, 12:39 am - Gerrard: 1pt off top right?
13/11/23, 12:40 am - Jono: Correct ✅
13/11/23, 12:40 am - Gerrard: Crisis right?
13/11/23, 12:40 am - Jono: Massif
13/11/23, 12:44 am - James: Liverpool are shit
13/11/23, 2:24 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/l1wWjtazR9w?si=ExGeEpT3V4quRNs1
Funny Saka take at the start
13/11/23, 2:50 am - Dave: Who would have predicted in 2019-2020, that liverpool fans would be celebrating 4 points combined from Luton and Brentford with Klopp quadruple fist pumping the crowd at kenilworth road after a 98th minute equaliser
13/11/23, 2:50 am - Gerrard: You were typing that long and that's all you got?
13/11/23, 2:51 am - Dave: They’re back when they beat someone decent and are top. Couldn’t get through Toulouse a few days ago even after being gifted an own goal
13/11/23, 2:51 am - Jono: You're probably also claiming it was an asterisks league win too
13/11/23, 2:52 am - Gerrard: You tell me???
(@61422023136 in the voice)
13/11/23, 2:52 am - Gerrard: Invincibles*
13/11/23, 2:52 am - Dave: Na. You were destroying the league before covid hit so you can have that one. That squad was arguably one of the best the prem has ever seen
13/11/23, 2:53 am - Dave: You’re a shell of that squad now though and anyone saying otherwise is delusional. That 2019-2020 squad would have put 10 past Luton and Toulouse last weekend. They were formidable
13/11/23, 2:55 am - Jono: I had expectations on winning maybe one more league in the immediate term after 19/20 - we almost did but almost isn't good enough
13/11/23, 2:55 am - Dave: You would have been dominant for years if it wasn’t for city
13/11/23, 2:56 am - Jono: Doesn't mean i won't enjoy the current consistency we seem to have in the PL even if we did fuck it at Luton (which Klopp admits)
13/11/23, 2:57 am - Gerrard: How dare you change in 4 years
13/11/23, 2:57 am - Dave: You seem to have got your resilience and belief back this season. Always seem to find a way to grind out results
13/11/23, 2:58 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 why you bother talking to this silly cunt?
13/11/23, 2:58 am - Dave: Well when you say “back”, are you insinuating back to this era? Because that’s how I’ve been taking it
13/11/23, 2:58 am - Dave: The 19-20 squad
13/11/23, 2:58 am - Dave: What’s “back”?
13/11/23, 2:59 am - Gerrard: I'm referring to the 2011/12 Liverpool
13/11/23, 2:59 am - Dave: Ahhh, the angry man is back. Didn’t even have to fish today, that’s what you get for being honest and reasonable
13/11/23, 3:00 am - Dave: Set that bar nice and low
13/11/23, 3:00 am - Gerrard: Sorry text messages innit, no anger in that statement just facts.
13/11/23, 3:01 am - Dave: 🪇
13/11/23, 3:02 am - Gerrard: I just see @61404060785 conversing with you like you have reasonable brain, and don't want him wasting his time - he's a good blokem
13/11/23, 3:02 am - Gerrard: *bloke.
13/11/23, 3:03 am - Gerrard: But at least you're not supporting in Arsenal
13/11/23, 3:04 am - Gerrard: *supporting Arsenal
13/11/23, 3:05 am - Gerrard: I only like 1 thing about Arsenal, seeing them bottle each season.
13/11/23, 3:21 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 Nunez only finishes good when he's offside
13/11/23, 4:04 am - James: Wow
13/11/23, 5:06 am - Gerrard: @61422023136 Pep looking a bit miffed in the post
13/11/23, 5:07 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 why you got disappearing messages!
13/11/23, 5:07 am - Gerrard: ?
13/11/23, 5:10 am - Jono: No idea
13/11/23, 5:13 am - Liam: Why so positive in here today, Liverpool won the league?
13/11/23, 5:14 am - Liam: Liverpool back?
13/11/23, 5:14 am - Liam: Did they replay the spurs game?
13/11/23, 5:41 am - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/shorts/My08P3qf9oU?si=f-e0TgirM79Tzz5U
Buvy upset
13/11/23, 5:41 am - Gerrard: 💯
13/11/23, 5:42 am - Gerrard: Rodders says we are
13/11/23, 5:42 am - Gerrard: Just imagine we didn't get screwed in that one
13/11/23, 5:45 am - Pero: Just needed another one or two annoying probing questions and he would of popped. See how he was insinuating the big squad and big market spend at chelsea to try convince us he hasn't spent as much
13/11/23, 5:46 am - James: Yeah Varpool supporters very active in here today
13/11/23, 5:47 am - James: Suppose it'll be less so when they get pumped by citeh in a few weeks...
13/11/23, 5:48 am - Gerrard: Yeah 💯, funny coming from City about Chelsea's spending lol
13/11/23, 5:49 am - James: Did Varpool spend more than citeh in the summer?
13/11/23, 5:49 am - Gerrard: More spin from the Spin King, I was way more active last week
13/11/23, 5:49 am - James: Did you @14244893404???
13/11/23, 5:49 am - James: It's only Monday...
13/11/23, 5:49 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 nice try at distract mr.Bournemouth
13/11/23, 5:50 am - James: OK Mr. Kill other teams fans
13/11/23, 5:50 am - Gerrard: Oooooooo he's finished work and ready to spin up a storm in here
13/11/23, 5:50 am - James: Mr. We rob our own players
13/11/23, 5:50 am - James: Nah, I'm active while at work or to and from
13/11/23, 5:51 am - James: I liked to get paid to shit talk
13/11/23, 5:51 am - Gerrard: Like how you think that making fun of Scouse Livo fans being crims are shots at us
13/11/23, 5:52 am - Gerrard: If I call Newty fans fat and houseo, do you get hurt?
13/11/23, 5:52 am - James: You support scum 🤷
13/11/23, 5:52 am - James: No I'd say you're a hypocrite
13/11/23, 5:52 am - Gerrard: The team robs houses?
13/11/23, 5:53 am - Gerrard: I love the standards of shittalk you set in here
13/11/23, 5:53 am - Gerrard: Reason has no place in here
13/11/23, 5:54 am - Gerrard: Reality has no place in here?
13/11/23, 5:54 am - James: It seems delusion does
13/11/23, 5:54 am - Gerrard: It certainly does
13/11/23, 5:55 am - Pero: Livo net spend maybe higher ?
13/11/23, 5:55 am - James: They took so much money from the Saudis 🫠
13/11/23, 5:56 am - Gerrard: Pot kettle
13/11/23, 5:56 am - James: Don't get @61409710717 on about net spend. He'll be consulting his 'coutinho money' excel spreadsheet
13/11/23, 5:56 am - Gerrard: Net spend for life
13/11/23, 5:56 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 you def don't like net spend
13/11/23, 5:57 am - James: I don't virtue signal about saudi
13/11/23, 5:57 am - James: Give me that blood money 🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦
13/11/23, 5:57 am - Gerrard: Love how any opinion against yours is virtue signalling
13/11/23, 5:59 am - Louie: What’s Ruben Dias doing sliding in the box? Maguire wouldn’t do that.
13/11/23, 6:00 am - Gerrard: Lol yeah Harry wouldn't be anywhere near the attacker
13/11/23, 6:01 am - James: Are Chelsea back?
13/11/23, 6:03 am - Pero: Seems like they play good only in the rain
13/11/23, 6:04 am - Pero: Money thirsty
13/11/23, 6:05 am - Louie: Palmer’s had two crucial penalties in two weeks. Boehly’s learnt you don’t need to spend all your money on players.
13/11/23, 6:11 am - Gerrard: I doubt he's learnt anything lol
13/11/23, 6:11 am - Gerrard: Having all that paper around absorbs the moisture in the air
13/11/23, 6:15 am - Gerrard: Steady on
13/11/23, 6:15 am - Gerrard: Above Newy yeah
13/11/23, 6:17 am - James: Thought it was just delusion about Varpool but I guess it's league wide now 👆
13/11/23, 6:17 am - James: Probably a good thing those messages are set to disappear lol
13/11/23, 6:17 am - Gerrard: Why do you react so badly when anyone mentions Newy???
13/11/23, 6:18 am - James: And slobo poty too heeey
13/11/23, 6:18 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 ears perked up
13/11/23, 6:19 am - Pero: If Jackson plays less they'll do better
13/11/23, 6:19 am - James: Nah he's drowning in his own piss by now. It's 7pm there
13/11/23, 6:20 am - Gerrard: @61478754484 how did you live with that?
13/11/23, 6:20 am - James: Chelsea won't do shit this season. All their key players are sick notes
13/11/23, 6:21 am - James: Spurs can't handle two players out injured and their manager ain't all that. Manure will still find ways to win games
13/11/23, 6:21 am - James: Villa are the disruptors this season unless they go far in the conference league
13/11/23, 6:22 am - James: Which, they should be favourites to win
13/11/23, 6:23 am - James: What's a pineapple. No joke. I'm not a degenerate gambler like Rodwell
13/11/23, 6:24 am - James: On Chelsea finishing above Newcastle?
13/11/23, 6:24 am - Liam: Best years of my life ❤️
13/11/23, 6:25 am - James: I'll take that bet 🤝
13/11/23, 6:25 am - Gerrard: Citizen and doesn't know smh
13/11/23, 6:26 am - Pero: That message will disappear in 7 days
13/11/23, 6:26 am - Gerrard: You should do Nunez more goals than Isak
13/11/23, 6:26 am - James: Any bets on who finishes higher between Varpool and Varsenal???
13/11/23, 6:26 am - James: 😆
13/11/23, 6:26 am - Gerrard: I don't gamble any more, poor
13/11/23, 6:27 am - Liam: I’ll take bets on both above newy
13/11/23, 6:27 am - James: You used to bet a lot on varsenal
13/11/23, 6:28 am - Gerrard: Only lost once
13/11/23, 6:28 am - James: I think you both will
13/11/23, 6:28 am - Gerrard: Unlikely Arsenal
13/11/23, 6:28 am - Gerrard: *Unlike
13/11/23, 6:28 am - James: 2nd and 3rd
13/11/23, 6:28 am - James: But who above who 🤔
13/11/23, 6:29 am - James: Who's the better team!?
13/11/23, 6:29 am - Gerrard: Arsenal may drop further
13/11/23, 6:29 am - James: They are the banter club after all
13/11/23, 6:29 am - Gerrard: Arteta wheels off and rattled
13/11/23, 6:29 am - James: The bottle club
13/11/23, 6:29 am - Gerrard: Embarrassing
13/11/23, 6:30 am - Gerrard: They gonna have a bronze trimmed jersey next year for coming 4th
13/11/23, 6:30 am - James: Do you think they'll actually try to do anything in the FA Cup or just get eliminated first go
13/11/23, 6:31 am - Gerrard: Don't think that result would be in their hands
13/11/23, 6:31 am - James: Ditto CL round of 16
13/11/23, 6:31 am - Gerrard: Same
13/11/23, 6:31 am - Gerrard: They might a low team though
13/11/23, 6:31 am - James: Who knocked them out league cup?
13/11/23, 6:32 am - Gerrard: Lower than Sporting Lisbon though, not sure
13/11/23, 6:33 am - Gerrard: Though Raya did stop them from going down 1-0 against Burnley so he might do a job in a knockout
13/11/23, 6:34 am - Gerrard: But Ramsdale plays cup games....
13/11/23, 6:34 am - James: Arteta could be in trouble if he doesn't bring home some silverware this season
13/11/23, 6:34 am - James: Can't be spending £100m on a DM and finish lower
13/11/23, 6:35 am - James: They'd be better off replacing him with a proven manager. Like the guy at Villa. Look at the job he's done
13/11/23, 6:37 am - Gerrard: Talking about top half teams wheel's coming off, how's about Brighton?
13/11/23, 6:41 am - James: Their squad is thin and been picked apart in the summer. Plus Europa League <This message was edited>
13/11/23, 6:41 am - Gerrard: Tifo had a video on people working out their tactic
13/11/23, 6:42 am - James: Their fans must be pissed off with the amount of money they've brought in
13/11/23, 6:42 am - James: Should have hundreds of mill for ffp spend
13/11/23, 6:42 am - James: They only play on way
13/11/23, 6:42 am - James: *one
13/11/23, 6:43 am - Gerrard: If you don't press them high then they got no space to knock it over
13/11/23, 6:44 am - James: Yeah if you do press them from goal kicks etc / man mark they'll turn the ball over and make mistakes
13/11/23, 6:44 am - James: They looked OK in Europe but the teams they're playing are shit. Ajax are bottom of the Dutch league I think
13/11/23, 6:45 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/3aDAUI10Neo?si=_nlsqlkKD9zPfu0P
13/11/23, 6:45 am - James: @61409710717 I feel as though Arsenal are pretty one dimensional too
13/11/23, 6:46 am - Gerrard: He's got a point about City and pens
13/11/23, 6:48 am - Gerrard: I think it's 4D, like in dimension we can't see them playing good football
13/11/23, 6:49 am - James: Only Matthew McConaughey can from behind a bookcase
13/11/23, 6:50 am - Jono: I have no idea about the message switch off thing hey
13/11/23, 6:50 am - Gerrard: That's all the Arsenal fans watching themselves betray Wenger in the past now knowing it was gonna get worse
13/11/23, 6:50 am - Jono: I didn't change any setting
13/11/23, 6:50 am - Jono: Trippy
13/11/23, 6:50 am - James: Don't let him resign murph?
13/11/23, 6:55 am - James: The Liverpool away game? Or Saka pen at West Ham?
13/11/23, 6:55 am - James: So many possibilities
13/11/23, 6:58 am - James: What they done since?
13/11/23, 7:09 am - Gerrard: One trophy?
13/11/23, 9:43 am - Dave: Why is this guy that sounds like Liam held in such high regard. From
Opposite end of country innit
13/11/23, 9:43 am - Dave: You said 2012. Yeah sure, from 2012
13/11/23, 9:45 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Arsenal facts again
13/11/23, 9:45 am - Gerrard: Damn, taking a shot at @61478754484 now, completely off the rails
13/11/23, 9:50 am - Liam: Who’s taking shots
13/11/23, 9:51 am - Gerrard: Rodders said Buevy is a cunt and he reminds him of you
13/11/23, 9:52 am - Gerrard: Unless I misread thab
13/11/23, 9:52 am - Gerrard: That
13/11/23, 10:06 am - James: Farmer cunt I think he said
13/11/23, 11:10 am - Liam: Not my Rodwell ❤️ try not being so toxic
13/11/23, 11:27 am - Gerrard: Yeah Rodders don't be toxic
13/11/23, 11:28 am - Gerrard: Liam's your only mate
13/11/23, 3:25 pm - Dave: See you Tuesday @61478754484 ❤️❤️❤️
13/11/23, 7:46 pm - Liam: ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
13/11/23, 11:13 pm - Gerrard: Also most net spend in first 150 games?
14/11/23, 12:36 am - James: Was Wenger handed £110m for one player
14/11/23, 12:40 am - Gerrard: I don't recall him being backed at all
14/11/23, 12:44 am - Pero: Too many big players that were let go for free its what happens when you want a full rebuild
14/11/23, 12:46 am - Gerrard: Can't believe the brainwashing has got to you too
14/11/23, 12:47 am - Liam: 🥱
14/11/23, 12:52 am - Pero: It explains the increase in net spend , just maths
14/11/23, 2:12 am - Dave: Bore off
14/11/23, 3:18 am - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/shorts/4okInjcQL08?si=bJyc8DDO9PTXXF_M
14/11/23, 3:21 am - James: Never a truer word said
14/11/23, 4:19 am - Dave: These lads are thick as pig shit
14/11/23, 4:22 am - Dave: Isn’t that the lad that said pope is better than Alisson? And put salah in his “flop of the season squad” last year?
14/11/23, 5:04 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 notice how he didn't argue any of their point, just starting talking about Liverpool to distract
14/11/23, 5:07 am - James: Just because he doesn't agree with one unrelated, previous, take, that doesn't have anything to do with what he's saying here
14/11/23, 5:14 am - James: It is an interesting take @61409710717, Howe took one year to take a team heading to the championship to CL football. Arteta has taken five years to take arsenal to CL football from 8th... <This message was edited>
14/11/23, 5:16 am - Gerrard: Howie spent not even half what Arteta did eh?
14/11/23, 5:16 am - Gerrard: Emery too
14/11/23, 5:17 am - James: Nah
14/11/23, 5:17 am - James: True
14/11/23, 5:17 am - James: The Ange bit was nonsense though
14/11/23, 5:18 am - Gerrard: I can't believe Arsenal fans were cheering on Chelsea in that game
14/11/23, 5:20 am - James: Wow
14/11/23, 5:21 am - James: @61409710717 Emery will win Villa a trophy before Arteta does for Arsenal (FA Cup doesn't count that was Emery's team)
14/11/23, 5:26 am - Gerrard: Yeah probably
14/11/23, 5:26 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 have you told him yet that I don't open his links?
14/11/23, 5:27 am - James: He just sent a link of Haaland scoring goals while at Dortmund
14/11/23, 5:28 am - James: Think he's been drinking again
14/11/23, 5:28 am - Dave: @61409710717 booting up YouTube every morning like
14/11/23, 5:30 am - Dave: You’re awfully punchy today 👃🏼
14/11/23, 5:31 am - Dave: The only man I hate more than those wankers on YouTube
14/11/23, 8:38 am - Jono: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CzOVGYRM0E3/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
14/11/23, 8:38 am - Jono: Delusion spreads hard through the north
14/11/23, 8:53 am - Gerrard: I agreed with the first one then he lost me
14/11/23, 9:11 am - Jono: That’s probably gang bang related
14/11/23, 9:11 am - Jono: Better bitches in Cataluña

14/11/23, 8:33 pm - James: 🍿
14/11/23, 8:42 pm - Jono: Just watched it. I still think it was from Joelinton though the ref not giving a foul left VAR without an option as it probably wasn’t a clear enough push to give it/
14/11/23, 8:42 pm - Jono: The show is on now on Optus sport if people can’t watch the sky sports links
14/11/23, 8:43 pm - Jono: A foul from*
14/11/23, 8:45 pm - James: Just embarrassing how arsenal fans thought they were so done over to the same degree as Varpool against spurs
14/11/23, 8:45 pm - James: Arteta should be fined
14/11/23, 8:49 pm - Jono: Yeah it’s nowhere near the same level as the LFC one. That was an error in communication and process from VAR
14/11/23, 9:41 pm - Gerrard: What does he think about the VAR audio?
14/11/23, 9:49 pm - Liam: Newy played great, no complaints
14/11/23, 9:50 pm - Dave: Respect the officials, audios out. Great result Newcastle
14/11/23, 9:51 pm - Dave: 🤝 Howard Webb
15/11/23, 2:44 am - Dave: Respect the managers decision, respect ramsdale, respect Raya
15/11/23, 3:00 am - Liam: Respect. Love the way Ramsdale is dealing with it, getting his head done and getting on with it. Love what Raya is doing on the pitch, what competition!!! Mikel is working magic!
15/11/23, 3:00 am - Liam: 🫡
15/11/23, 3:04 am - James: Both bang average keepers @61409710717
15/11/23, 3:05 am - James: Knew Ramsdale was a headcase at least now he's publically admitted he has a problem
15/11/23, 3:12 am - Gerrard: Arteta doesn't respect Ramsdale
15/11/23, 3:16 am - James: Doesn't respect anybody
15/11/23, 3:17 am - Gerrard: Doesn't respect refs
15/11/23, 3:20 am - Liam: Na, he’s a great bloke, very respectful. I think you both may have this wrong, but I respect your opinions.
15/11/23, 4:10 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/Q7XtfFl39_w?si=z44c18-_gCyEMXXx
@61452662705 I know he's a twat but he's not wrong eh
15/11/23, 4:34 am - James: Some might say arsenal not being known as a big club is known all around the world
15/11/23, 4:34 am - Liam: 🥱
15/11/23, 4:37 am - Gerrard: Poor Liam, tired from his flight
15/11/23, 5:07 am - James: Where's he gone
15/11/23, 5:07 am - Dave: We’ve won more trophies than you both combined in the last 30 years. 

Arsenal - 24 
Liverpool - 19 
Newcastle - 0 

Currently 1 point off top of the league and top of our champions league group. Exactly where we want to be. COYG 🔴 ⚪️ ❤️
15/11/23, 5:36 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 he's rattled hard.
Love it when he just draws a line in history and goes "we're awesome if you only count this period of time!"
15/11/23, 5:38 am - Dave: Literally never been happier lol
15/11/23, 5:40 am - Dave: It’s a fantastic time to be an Arsenal fan, got so much to be pleased about. Years of hurt leading up to last season and now we’re one of the best teams in the world, what a time to be alive
15/11/23, 5:41 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 winning nothing last season and this season > the invincibles season apparently
15/11/23, 5:43 am - Dave: Who said that? Invincibles will never be beaten. First and only time it was ever done
15/11/23, 5:43 am - Gerrard: Literally
15/11/23, 5:43 am - Gerrard: Never
15/11/23, 5:43 am - Gerrard: Been
15/11/23, 5:43 am - Gerrard: Happier
15/11/23, 5:43 am - Gerrard: Lol
15/11/23, 5:50 am - Gerrard: Invincibles, Winning leagues, Winning cups, Wenger, Henry, Bergkamp - none of these made him happier than 2nd place with Arteta winning nothing @61452662705
15/11/23, 5:52 am - Liam: Arteta is changing football 😍
15/11/23, 5:54 am - Dave: Growth mindset. Can’t live in the past like a lot of fans, we’re moving forward 💪 👊
15/11/23, 5:56 am - Liam: It’s Incredible what arteta has done for arsenal. And he’s only just getting started
15/11/23, 5:56 am - Liam: ❤️
15/11/23, 5:56 am - Liam: Just the beginning
15/11/23, 5:57 am - Dave: Rebuilt the club, the squad and the culture from the ground up. Unbelievable. Revived our club
15/11/23, 5:57 am - Liam: 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
15/11/23, 5:58 am - Liam: Honestly did you see the squad he had at the start
15/11/23, 5:58 am - Liam: Unbelievable
15/11/23, 5:59 am - Liam: What he did with saka. Left bank to best right forward in the world 🤌🏼
15/11/23, 6:00 am - Dave: Right?! He was born for this job. Actually outrageous what he’s achieved in his first managerial role
15/11/23, 6:00 am - Dave: Turned a 6mil Brazilian teenager into best left winger in England
15/11/23, 6:17 am - James: Lots of messages @61409710717
15/11/23, 6:17 am - James: They still going on about var
15/11/23, 6:17 am - Gerrard: I was about to say 🪇
15/11/23, 6:18 am - Gerrard: Nah he's saying that Arteta coming 2nd has made him happier than the Invincibles season
15/11/23, 6:18 am - Liam: Saka ❤️
15/11/23, 6:18 am - James: Oh cools
15/11/23, 8:02 am - Gerrard: Happiest
15/11/23, 9:46 am - Shaun: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 9:57 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I piss excellence
15/11/23, 10:01 am - James: You're winning
15/11/23, 10:02 am - Gerrard: Still respectable in 2nd, couldn't do it without you
15/11/23, 10:02 am - Gerrard: @61422023136 lucky it's top 5 in CL this year
15/11/23, 10:02 am - James: CL qualification
15/11/23, 10:03 am - Gerrard: I remember you asked who Shaun supports.
It's statistics, he loves em.
15/11/23, 10:04 am - Gerrard: @61491126732 you got the poo one?
15/11/23, 10:04 am - James: Nah this league too small. Top two CL, Jono can go in the Europa (should be familiar with it by now) and Rodders in the farmer conference
15/11/23, 10:05 am - James: Doesn't need to support anyone if he produces stats like that for in here
15/11/23, 10:05 am - Gerrard: @61491126732 I want stats on all the times Rodders is rattled
15/11/23, 10:06 am - James: Glad my work doesn't have access to this info
15/11/23, 10:06 am - Gerrard: That's why Rodders left Australia, toxic messages got expose
15/11/23, 10:07 am - Shaun: i'll try to do a work cloud in the future
15/11/23, 10:07 am - James: You're like the Man City of the group Gez with a lead like that
15/11/23, 10:08 am - James: Pep McKeown
15/11/23, 10:08 am - Gerrard: Cheating the whole time
15/11/23, 10:08 am - Gerrard: That makes you Kloppy bruva
15/11/23, 10:09 am - Gerrard: And it makes Pero Arteta
15/11/23, 10:09 am - James: Jono Postegoglu
15/11/23, 10:10 am - Gerrard: Rodders Emery
15/11/23, 12:12 pm - Pero: Jono would love that. I reckon jono would prefer ange over klopp at Liverpool
15/11/23, 12:13 pm - Gerrard: yeah and st.peppers album over the white album too

16/11/23, 3:17 am - Dave: Wish we hadn’t let him go
16/11/23, 3:17 am - Dave: Literally in his prime
16/11/23, 3:18 am - Liam: Ya xhaka was class
16/11/23, 3:18 am - Dave: Salivate over rice and xhaka tearing up that midfield
16/11/23, 3:18 am - Liam: What Mikel did with him….. just wow
16/11/23, 3:18 am - Dave: Fueled by passion, vision and elite cardio
16/11/23, 3:25 am - Gerrard: Guess being betrayed by Arsenal fans worked out for him, best career choice he could've made was leaving toxic Arsenal
16/11/23, 3:26 am - Gerrard: Well reading that makes it sound like Mikel mismanaged him and Xabi set him free
16/11/23, 3:27 am - Dave: Did you watch him play last season? Elite
16/11/23, 3:27 am - Gerrard: Was he on the field when Arsenal bottled the season? Then yes, yes I did see him play.
16/11/23, 3:28 am - Liam: He didn’t watch football last season. It was too traumatic
16/11/23, 3:42 am - Dave: Just disappeared into his cave didn’t he. 

Set up a new group for traumatised liverpool fans only, English banned. Then invited us all back when he got a chub on cause liverpool beat a string of mid table clubs
16/11/23, 4:00 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 never addressing the actual topic, just personal attacks, rattled 🪇
16/11/23, 4:38 am - Liam: Cowardly! Truly pathetic.
16/11/23, 4:54 am - Dave: Total coward. Only supports his team when they’re winning, then abandons ship

16/11/23, 5:30 am - Dave: Won a trophy ✅
16/11/23, 6:07 am - Gerrard: I'm starting to feel bad for Arsenal fans, sorry bro
16/11/23, 6:24 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/gdeG0zOnuaQ?si=FQwQHZuwye0TC6Ls
16/11/23, 6:49 am - James: Falling apart behind the scenes
16/11/23, 6:51 am - Gerrard: I wouldn't say Raya is much better than AAron, so this has all been a giant fuck you by Arteta
16/11/23, 7:10 am - James: You know you've hit rock bottom when you include Keys and Gray on your side 😬
16/11/23, 7:11 am - Gerrard: Fucking get over it, Livo ain't even talking about an actual screw over anymore
16/11/23, 7:11 am - James: If I go on anything Newcastle related, twitter, insta etc all the comments are angry arsenal fans
16/11/23, 7:12 am - James: I dunno if they've stopped their racist attacks on Willock yet
16/11/23, 7:14 am - James: @61409710717 wouldn't it be hilarious if Varsenal missed out on the title by a point
16/11/23, 7:17 am - Gerrard: No comment because I'm thinking about Livo's dropped points at Tottenham, because you know...... it's more realistic than Arsenal being in a title race.
16/11/23, 7:19 am - Gerrard: 1pt missing out on Top 5 💯
16/11/23, 8:04 am - Dave: What’s Livo? Never heard that word before?
16/11/23, 8:05 am - Dave: Sounds like a disease
16/11/23, 8:05 am - Dave: STI maybe @61478754484 ?
16/11/23, 8:05 am - Liam: Ya never heard the word livo in England before?
16/11/23, 8:06 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 A-class comebacks
16/11/23, 8:07 am - Dave: Doubt @61452662705 has ever heard of it either?
16/11/23, 8:49 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/-Llh7ZFTplE?si=5qEHDxYg_KkNV77g

@61413646755
16/11/23, 10:07 am - Louie: It’s a shame we didn’t keep Rangnick. Our recruitment team are useless, don’t know how they are all still employed.
16/11/23, 11:53 pm - James: https://x.com/SkySportsNews/status/1725234379092345273?s=08
16/11/23, 11:53 pm - James: Arteta CHARGED 🙌
17/11/23, 12:09 am - Pero: Geez what about all the pep, klopp, dyche etc emotional reactions in the past. #AgendaAgainstArteta
17/11/23, 12:19 am - Dave: Pathetic isn’t it
17/11/23, 12:19 am - Liam: Massive #AgendaAgainstArteta
17/11/23, 12:46 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 here we go
17/11/23, 12:46 am - Gerrard: @61404487873 Haaland injured?
17/11/23, 12:53 am - Jono: Haaland injury against Faroe Islands in a friendly
17/11/23, 12:54 am - Jono: Pep will love that
17/11/23, 1:29 am - Gerrard: Now Alvarez will fuck us, Haaland is easy to defend
17/11/23, 2:55 am - Jono: Nuñez scores the winner vs the world champions
17/11/23, 2:55 am - Jono: 🇺🇾
17/11/23, 3:31 am - Gerrard: Diaz scored two against the scum Brazilians to win
17/11/23, 3:31 am - Gerrard: Then they showed his ugly parents in the crowd crying
17/11/23, 4:06 am - James: Look like he had a heart attack from the clip I saw
17/11/23, 4:07 am - James: Hasn't Diaz got enough money to get his parents out of that shit hole
17/11/23, 4:12 am - Gerrard: It's their home bro, not everyone leaves their shitholes like you did
17/11/23, 4:21 am - James: Cambridge is a shit hole?
17/11/23, 4:22 am - Gerrard: Yeah why not, it's in England right?
What makes Colombia a shithole but not England?
17/11/23, 4:22 am - James: Cambridge is a crime ridden smelly shit hole like the whole of columbia
17/11/23, 4:23 am - James: Yeah I guess Columbia is right up there with the UK, Germany, Norway, France etc on all metrics 😂
17/11/23, 4:23 am - James: Diaz is asking for his dad to lose his head
17/11/23, 4:24 am - James: What a wanker
17/11/23, 4:24 am - Gerrard: Sounding very UKIP today Jimmy
17/11/23, 4:24 am - Gerrard: Even Tory
17/11/23, 4:24 am - James: Actually, whatever shit hole town his dad is from, it's probably better than Merseyside tbf
17/11/23, 4:25 am - Gerrard: Homelessness is a choice?
17/11/23, 4:25 am - Gerrard: So England is a shithole then?
17/11/23, 4:25 am - James: Aside from the Wirral, Liverpool is gross 💩
17/11/23, 4:26 am - Gerrard: So England is a shithole then?
17/11/23, 4:26 am - James: Some parts. Especially NW
17/11/23, 4:27 am - Gerrard: So there was nothing wrong with my initial comment then?
17/11/23, 4:27 am - James: My home is Cambridge
17/11/23, 4:27 am - James: Cambridge isn't a shit hole
17/11/23, 4:28 am - Gerrard: Which is part of England, and England is a shithole?
17/11/23, 4:28 am - James: Where you're from here, is a shit hole right?
17/11/23, 4:28 am - Gerrard: Australia is a shithole too, you do see when I'm going here?
17/11/23, 4:29 am - James: I think Shaun is right and you should be quieter
17/11/23, 4:31 am - Gerrard: Sorry to point out how bad it is to say someone's home is a shithole and they should leave the place they love.
17/11/23, 4:31 am - James: https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/standard-of-living-by-country
17/11/23, 4:32 am - James: Yeah Colombia is a shit hole
17/11/23, 4:33 am - James: Are you mates with Diaz? Is he in this group chat? Is there a Columbian in this group chat I may have offended?
17/11/23, 4:33 am - Gerrard: I just hate people being racist
17/11/23, 4:34 am - James: By being racist yourself?
17/11/23, 4:34 am - Gerrard: I hate how racist the English are
17/11/23, 4:34 am - James: And it isn't racism. Why do Australians not understand what racism means 😂
17/11/23, 4:34 am - James: We've had this discussion in here several times
17/11/23, 4:34 am - James: Australia wins that award broski
17/11/23, 4:35 am - Gerrard: Why do the English want to become scientists when someone accuses them of racism?
17/11/23, 4:36 am - Liam: Australians wouldn’t even let aboriginals have a voice. Totally racist
17/11/23, 4:37 am - Gerrard: @61478754484 thought you were Irish?
17/11/23, 4:37 am - James: Didn't class them as humans till '72
17/11/23, 4:40 am - Dave: You know what’s racist.. 

Disliking a comment made by one man of a certain nationality, then branding an entire nationality as racist. 

I guess with that logic, all Palestinians are Hamas and all Israelis are pro genocide?
17/11/23, 4:40 am - Gerrard: Enter the This Is England king
17/11/23, 4:40 am - James: Yeah he does that a lot
17/11/23, 4:40 am - Gerrard: Bow down
17/11/23, 4:40 am - Dave: Classic. You’re a racist
17/11/23, 4:41 am - James: Jerry the generaliser
17/11/23, 4:41 am - Dave: Selective outrage generalising racist
17/11/23, 4:41 am - James: Selective about a lot of things isn't he
17/11/23, 4:42 am - Gerrard: Why do the English reaction with such a fervour when accused?
It's almost like they've had this conversation multiple times from multiple accusations....
17/11/23, 4:42 am - Gerrard: *react
17/11/23, 4:42 am - Gerrard: Or is it just 🪇
17/11/23, 4:42 am - Gerrard: Weird that
17/11/23, 4:43 am - Gerrard: The English are such bastards
17/11/23, 4:43 am - Liam: Racist coward.
17/11/23, 4:43 am - James: It isn't. Don't even have to do any research really. Especially when conversing with an Australian about things like this. Australian's aren't the most self aware bunch so their flawed arguments are easy to pick apart
17/11/23, 4:45 am - Dave: Native Australians not allowed a voice in their own country 50 years ago. “YoU enGlIsh aRe sO RacIsT”
17/11/23, 4:46 am - Gerrard: I think the world would be a better place if we eradicated the English
17/11/23, 4:47 am - Gerrard: I hate how the English all smell like wet dogs
17/11/23, 4:47 am - James: Yeah I might add I don't mean aboriginals when I say Australians. I mean the made up Australians that aren't even real like gez
17/11/23, 4:47 am - James: OK adolf
17/11/23, 4:48 am - Gerrard: That's racist bro
17/11/23, 4:49 am - James: I have to get on with my day. So, before I go, we're all clear that @61409710717 is a massive racist?
17/11/23, 4:57 am - Dave: Gerard Mchitler
17/11/23, 4:57 am - Liam: And a coward
17/11/23, 4:57 am - Gerrard: That's double racist bro
17/11/23, 4:58 am - Gerrard: I thought you were Irish?
But the good kind, not those dirty Prods
17/11/23, 7:03 am - Dave: Thought you were a protty?
17/11/23, 7:12 am - Gerrard: Now bringing sectarianism into it, the fucking English
17/11/23, 7:13 am - Dave: Using words you don’t understand again
17/11/23, 7:17 am - Gerrard: Talking down to other nation's people, typical fucking English
17/11/23, 10:58 am - Jono: The disease of racism in this country stemmed from day 1  and just followed through to conditional multiculturalism where people of all backgrounds were allowed in so long as they were segregated as that was “by law” the only way to replicate the exiling of aborigines for ever generation prior. That segregation that’s lived on the last 5 decades has now just blended in to the casual racism that exists here and pretty certain in the UK too. We’re all the fucking same.
17/11/23, 1:34 pm - James: Yeah Gez is racist
17/11/23, 5:03 pm - Dave: https://x.com/francischipp/status/1725495411702395246?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA

18/11/23, 1:26 am - Gerrard: This a joke?
18/11/23, 1:30 am - Gerrard: That motherfucker don't miss!

18/11/23, 3:10 am - Liam: It’s just click bait, don’t worry about it mate. Newcastle did deserved to win.
18/11/23, 3:14 am - Liam: Keowns a fucking racist anyway.
18/11/23, 3:46 am - Dave: You mean McKeown?
18/11/23, 11:41 am - Gerrard: Keown is just another cunt English scum
18/11/23, 6:26 pm - Dave: When you’re comparing Trent against those two muppets, the bars hardly been set high. Southgate masterclass as usual, struggling to pick up a win against fucking Malta. 

If Trent is better than Rice and prime Zidane, I’m not sure why Klopp, a manager that actually knows what he’s doing, isn’t building his midfield around him
18/11/23, 9:30 pm - Liam: Legend
18/11/23, 9:50 pm - Jono: And you still called for his head
19/11/23, 1:11 am - Gerrard: Especially when you consider what a shitshow they are as a club.
19/11/23, 1:12 am - Gerrard: No loyalty
19/11/23, 6:15 am - James: Who's her fave?

20/11/23, 12:35 am - James: Gay basher
20/11/23, 12:42 am - Dave: Got it all hasn’t he
20/11/23, 2:33 am - Gerrard: "footballer drinks alcohol" 👏👏👏👏 <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 2:34 am - Gerrard: Slow news day, fucking international breaks
20/11/23, 2:34 am - Gerrard: Don't wanna hear about it unless it's a Grealish bender level drinking

This is more like it <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 6:16 am - James: No way Eliot can disrespect Kane 🫣
20/11/23, 6:16 am - James: Club should also be sanctioned
20/11/23, 6:17 am - Gerrard: The stadium wasn't safe to be in, blame those fucking Belgians
20/11/23, 6:18 am - Gerrard: Calling out his lisp lol
20/11/23, 6:18 am - James: Stop blaming others
20/11/23, 6:18 am - James: Eliot looked a decent player before his injury
20/11/23, 6:19 am - James: Agree shouldn't be anywhere near an England squad. Maybe he can go to Scotland or Ireland?
20/11/23, 6:20 am - Jono: Elliot been one of our best this season after struggling last season coming back from the injury.
20/11/23, 6:20 am - Jono: I assumed perhaps if he kept playing like last season we’d probably let him go though I’d say Klopp has other plans now
20/11/23, 6:21 am - James: Probably would have let a lot of players go if they carried on from last season tbf
20/11/23, 6:22 am - James: Like maddison calling Bale a monkey
20/11/23, 6:23 am - James: I remember when Mido said Sol Campbell was the easiest CB he's played against while he was still playing. We need more of this shit talk in the game
20/11/23, 6:24 am - Jono: Antonio is giving it a crack
20/11/23, 6:24 am - Jono: But not really working for the brother
20/11/23, 6:24 am - James: He and Wilson aren't on Richalsons Christmas list
20/11/23, 6:25 am - James: Last season they had a laugh about how many times he took his shirt off to celebrate a goal that ended up disallowed
20/11/23, 6:25 am - James: Paqueta told Antonio Richardson is still fuming about it
20/11/23, 6:26 am - James: *richarlson
20/11/23, 6:26 am - Gerrard: I would love all Livo players to retire from internationals
20/11/23, 6:26 am - Gerrard: Settle
20/11/23, 6:27 am - James: Especially these recent fixtures
20/11/23, 6:27 am - James: In Europe anyway
20/11/23, 6:28 am - Gerrard: I wish Robbo had retired 2months agp
20/11/23, 6:28 am - James: Thank God a few of ours withdrew. We have 12 fit players atm
20/11/23, 6:28 am - James: No point playing for Scotland anyway
20/11/23, 6:29 am - Gerrard: Exactly
20/11/23, 6:29 am - James: See the French team?
20/11/23, 6:29 am - James: Did they need to call up and play the players they did
20/11/23, 6:30 am - James: To beat whoever it was 14-0
20/11/23, 6:30 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 you seem in a better mood this week, shall I dare say.... happier?
20/11/23, 6:30 am - James: A weight has been lifted
20/11/23, 6:30 am - Jono: Newcastle didn’t play
20/11/23, 6:30 am - James: But also happy I'm not as ill as I was
20/11/23, 6:30 am - Jono: Cause for celebration
20/11/23, 6:31 am - James: I'm not looking forward to the run up to Christmas lol
20/11/23, 6:31 am - James: Brutal
20/11/23, 6:44 am - Dave: Justice for the 32
20/11/23, 6:46 am - James: 39?
20/11/23, 6:46 am - Dave: Getting a lot of hype this kid
20/11/23, 6:46 am - James: Plus 600 injured?
20/11/23, 6:46 am - Dave: 32 juventus fans
20/11/23, 6:47 am - Dave: 39 total
20/11/23, 6:47 am - James: Arsenal didn't get to play in Europe in 89-90 because of Liverpool
20/11/23, 6:48 am - James: And in 88 😬
20/11/23, 6:48 am - Dave: Knew it was Liverpools fault
20/11/23, 6:49 am - Dave: Pretty racist to ban a whole nation of teams thanks to the scousers. Very @61409710717esque style of governance
20/11/23, 6:49 am - James: Considering they're not English apparently
20/11/23, 6:50 am - Dave: Should have been banned on their own. Create their own European cup for thieving rats with shit accents
20/11/23, 6:50 am - James: McKeowneon
20/11/23, 6:51 am - James: Tell us what you really think 😳
20/11/23, 6:53 am - Dave: The anti-arsenal brigade has tipped me over the edge
20/11/23, 6:53 am - James: Howard Webb?
20/11/23, 6:55 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 your mate
20/11/23, 6:56 am - Dave: No need for that
20/11/23, 7:02 am - James: Shocking defending
20/11/23, 7:02 am - James: Reminds me of that video of Zaha running past every crystal Palace player from their woman's team
20/11/23, 7:03 am - James: Very Sunday league defence
20/11/23, 7:03 am - James: That their 'elite' u16s???
20/11/23, 7:06 am - Dave: Looks like a typical weekend against Trent imo
20/11/23, 10:41 pm - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/shorts/uwObfqy0Y1g?si=wHzl6eKA5HpZuysF
@61452662705 your mate
20/11/23, 10:42 pm - Gerrard: Headline should've been "Liverpool fly Luis Diaz's family out of shithole"
20/11/23, 10:46 pm - Pero: Italy v ukraine cracker 0-0 game, mudryk chopped in the box 93rd min ... no pen
20/11/23, 10:47 pm - Jono: Ukraine can’t take a trick atm
20/11/23, 10:48 pm - Pero: Eye ties lucky once again
20/11/23, 10:50 pm - Gerrard: Check your Insta, sent you a good one about Italians and the N-word
20/11/23, 10:56 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 what do you think about Arsenal's and Liverpool's defences?
Then also in reference to Newy's defence.
21/11/23, 1:56 am - James: Collectively decent but prone to individual errors and in arsenals  case, prone to cracking when under pressure
21/11/23, 1:57 am - James: Are you flexing after 12 games again
21/11/23, 1:57 am - Gerrard: Facts are facts, no flexing.
Just curious about your interpretation of football.
21/11/23, 1:58 am - Gerrard: Arsenal equal best too
21/11/23, 1:58 am - James: Who cares
21/11/23, 1:58 am - Gerrard: How things appear vs how they actually are
21/11/23, 1:59 am - James: Newcastle third best?
21/11/23, 1:59 am - James: Second or third top scorers too?
21/11/23, 1:59 am - James: Who cares
21/11/23, 1:59 am - James: Arsenals defence didn't keep Gordon out the other week 🤷
21/11/23, 2:00 am - Gerrard: Just curious about people holding onto concepts, like I said I still see Arsenal as a giant mess
21/11/23, 2:00 am - James: That's OK
21/11/23, 2:00 am - Gerrard: Stinking, burning garbage fire <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 2:00 am - Gerrard: With Arteta pouring gasoline on it
21/11/23, 2:00 am - James: I remember saying ramsgate was shit for years and being told I was wrong. Now I am right all of a sudden
21/11/23, 2:01 am - Gerrard: I think he's better than Raya
21/11/23, 2:01 am - James: Don't think anything has changed
21/11/23, 2:01 am - James: Never thought much of him. Sa at wolves is better
21/11/23, 2:02 am - Gerrard: I think Saka is just a decent prem player and hasn't done anything yet but I hear he's better than Salah from Arsenal fans
21/11/23, 2:02 am - James: And foden apparently
21/11/23, 2:24 am - Dave: Incorrect. We have a far better xGC
21/11/23, 2:27 am - Dave: As @61452662705 stated multiple times last season, defences win titles
21/11/23, 2:29 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 see how they are?
21/11/23, 2:29 am - Dave: Facts only
21/11/23, 2:29 am - Dave: Facts hurt liverpool fans feelings though
21/11/23, 2:38 am - James: So we're better than varpool
21/11/23, 2:50 am - Gerrard: Can't be happy with equal best
21/11/23, 2:51 am - Gerrard: Love make believe stats
21/11/23, 2:57 am - Dave: You seen who you’ve played?
21/11/23, 2:59 am - Dave: Toulouse, Everton, forest, Luton, cherries and brentford? And you’re in here swinging your dick around. You fought for your life against half of them as well
21/11/23, 2:59 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 STATS or emotions here?
21/11/23, 2:59 am - Dave: Consistently top of the table then ✅
21/11/23, 3:00 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Arsenal fandom, different sauce
21/11/23, 3:00 am - Gerrard: He's still going

21/11/23, 3:01 am - Gerrard: Not quick enough
21/11/23, 3:01 am - Gerrard: Lol pathetic
21/11/23, 3:01 am - Gerrard: Deleted a message, gutless <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 3:01 am - Dave: Made me giggle
21/11/23, 3:02 am - Gerrard: Can't delete Arsenal's bottle pedigree
21/11/23, 3:05 am - Dave: You going to admit you’ve had an very easy run so far with full squad?
21/11/23, 3:06 am - Dave: Newcastle and arsenal plagued by injuries with difficult fixtures and still got better stats
21/11/23, 3:06 am - Dave: Facts only
21/11/23, 4:16 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I think he's talking to you
21/11/23, 9:41 am - Jono: https://open.spotify.com/episode/02YJZ2yTEUUe9gNMuTdgky?si=JWmN6i7xSkGlUxOtNBY5hA
21/11/23, 9:43 am - Jono: May cause arousal if you’re holding out hope City will get punished
21/11/23, 10:24 am - Gerrard: Got the highlights?
21/11/23, 10:32 am - Gerrard: Would be funny to see City or Chelsea get proper fucked
21/11/23, 10:34 am - James: Citeh and Chelsea to League 2
21/11/23, 10:34 am - Gerrard: Pro quits
21/11/23, 10:34 am - Gerrard: Pep
21/11/23, 10:34 am - James: Chelsea will get away with it
21/11/23, 10:35 am - James: Old ownership group
21/11/23, 10:35 am - James: Plus will the premier league really punish two of the 'big six'
21/11/23, 10:36 am - Gerrard: This all because Charles announced the regulator
21/11/23, 10:37 am - James: 1 charge = -10 points 😳
21/11/23, 10:37 am - Gerrard: God bless the Twat
21/11/23, 10:37 am - James: Funny how Everton get punished now
21/11/23, 10:38 am - James: Where even if they had a 20 point deduction they'd still stay up because the promoted clubs are so wank this season
21/11/23, 10:38 am - James: Plus this doesn't help the clubs who went down last two years while Everton cheated
21/11/23, 10:39 am - Gerrard: How's about the talksports wankers and fans calling up - "points deduction just hurts the fans" go eat a dick
21/11/23, 10:39 am - James: I hope they all win their legal fights and Everton go into administration
21/11/23, 10:39 am - Gerrard: Hope those clubs sue them
21/11/23, 10:40 am - James: And Calvert Lewin and Davies announce they're in a relationship
21/11/23, 10:40 am - Gerrard: And always referring to City and Chelsea - Your club blatantly broke the rules
21/11/23, 10:41 am - Gerrard: That fact doesn't change because others did too
21/11/23, 10:41 am - James: They only broke it by 6m a season for three seasons too
21/11/23, 10:41 am - James: Imagine what citeh did
21/11/23, 10:41 am - Gerrard: 19.5m over the limit, ooops
21/11/23, 10:42 am - James: It's not massive is it
21/11/23, 10:42 am - James: Still ten points
21/11/23, 10:42 am - Gerrard: Then why do it
21/11/23, 10:42 am - James: Because they'd thought they'd be able to use covid as an excuse maybe
21/11/23, 10:42 am - Gerrard: They knew the rules, in for a penny in fit a pound
21/11/23, 10:42 am - Gerrard: Fuck em
21/11/23, 10:42 am - James: Bad accounting?
21/11/23, 10:42 am - James: They ran terribly
21/11/23, 10:42 am - James: *They are
21/11/23, 10:43 am - Gerrard: Manslaughter then
21/11/23, 10:43 am - Gerrard: Still guilty
21/11/23, 10:43 am - James: They finished 5th with Silva didn't they
21/11/23, 10:43 am - James: $700m later and now look at them
21/11/23, 10:43 am - Gerrard: No idea
21/11/23, 11:05 am - Jono: Shearer brought this up. All strategic
21/11/23, 11:07 am - Jono: Yeah that was their argument
21/11/23, 11:10 am - Jono: I have no idea how any club managed to stay legit during covid given how much business was still playing out while stadiums were empty for over a season
21/11/23, 11:25 am - James: Yeah they'd have gone down last season
21/11/23, 11:26 am - James: Leeds etc will probably win a case against them tbf
21/11/23, 11:28 am - James: Bucket loads of TV money in reserve
21/11/23, 11:29 am - James: EFL also got a load distributed through the 72 clubs
21/11/23, 9:01 pm - Jono: The 7 clubs who voted against it wasn’t at all surprising lol
21/11/23, 9:02 pm - James: Did Varpool vote for or against?
21/11/23, 9:02 pm - James: And spurs?
21/11/23, 9:02 pm - James: I bet the whole meeting was called by levy
21/11/23, 9:03 pm - Jono: It’s okay. Didn’t want teams having excuses for failing anyway
21/11/23, 9:04 pm - Jono: At least now all that Jan business should count for something
21/11/23, 9:04 pm - James: Unlucky 😢
21/11/23, 9:04 pm - James: Sponsorship one is a kick in the nuts too
21/11/23, 9:04 pm - James: Really unlucky
21/11/23, 9:14 pm - Liam: Cowards, I don’t want to hear any complaints. They voted against automated VAR for offsides and then complain when the officals get it wrong.
21/11/23, 9:16 pm - Jono: #noexcuses
21/11/23, 9:27 pm - James: Unluckyyyyyy
21/11/23, 9:27 pm - James: Trying to change rules mid season 😂
21/11/23, 9:28 pm - James: 🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦
21/11/23, 9:29 pm - James: Angry a premier league club voted against what they wanted 💩
21/11/23, 9:35 pm - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/shorts/JPkJoloZ3rA?si=via7Mqe3NxYFyRrh
21/11/23, 9:36 pm - Jono: She’ll be dead by 13
21/11/23, 9:41 pm - Gerrard: She grazed his arm, head off
21/11/23, 10:06 pm - James: She'll be in the kitchen
21/11/23, 10:07 pm - James: Not talking
21/11/23, 10:07 pm - James: Only speaking when spoken to
21/11/23, 10:07 pm - James: 💫
21/11/23, 10:29 pm - Dave: You almost sound like you’re pro sharia @61452662705
21/11/23, 10:32 pm - Jono: For the glory of a mid table finish
21/11/23, 10:36 pm - Dave: And signing some murderers, gambling addicts and mid players for extortionate amounts of money
21/11/23, 10:44 pm - Dave: Remember reading about this lad
21/11/23, 10:46 pm - Jono: Perfect “in memoriam” photo
22/11/23, 12:15 am - James: 🇸🇦❤️
22/11/23, 12:17 am - James: Which is the lad
22/11/23, 12:17 am - James: That's a guy and a tranny?
22/11/23, 12:52 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 just between me and you, no one cares about Newy
22/11/23, 1:24 am - Jono: https://x.com/OptusSport/status/1727099822547869973?s=20
22/11/23, 1:24 am - Jono: Lol
22/11/23, 1:24 am - Jono: Great tackle
22/11/23, 1:28 am - James: Think a lot of people do now. Rattle city 😢
22/11/23, 1:28 am - James: Stop it
22/11/23, 1:28 am - James: Troll
22/11/23, 1:40 am - Jono: https://x.com/sbssportau/status/1727124548607525052?s=48
22/11/23, 2:06 am - Gerrard: Only way he can slag off Liverpool players is by using City's players, running the numbers on Arsenal players didn't yield good results I guess....
22/11/23, 2:07 am - James: This is like when Liverpool are playing
22/11/23, 2:15 am - James: Based off of...
22/11/23, 2:19 am - Gerrard: Awesomeness
22/11/23, 2:23 am - Dave: What? What’s troll about that?
22/11/23, 2:24 am - Dave: Hatred for City 🧂
22/11/23, 2:25 am - James: Carlo is better than klipp
22/11/23, 2:25 am - James: Jose is better than klapp
22/11/23, 2:25 am - James: Pepy is better
22/11/23, 2:29 am - Gerrard: Carlo is a whore
22/11/23, 2:29 am - Gerrard: Jose is toxic
22/11/23, 2:29 am - James: Better managers
22/11/23, 2:29 am - James: Managed bigger teams and won way more trophies
22/11/23, 2:29 am - James: Legacy managers like pep
22/11/23, 2:29 am - Gerrard: Pepy is Anna Nicole Smith
22/11/23, 2:30 am - Gerrard: Klopp is better than Fergie
22/11/23, 2:30 am - James: Klopp won't go down as one of the greatest unless he wins more leagues and cls
22/11/23, 2:31 am - Gerrard: You hate him because he won't go down on you?
22/11/23, 2:31 am - James: Didn't say go down on one of the greatest
22/11/23, 2:31 am - Gerrard: Klopp is better than Wenger
22/11/23, 2:31 am - James: Steve Bruce is better than him
22/11/23, 2:32 am - James: How many games arsene managed?
22/11/23, 2:32 am - Gerrard: Salah is better than Thierry Henry
22/11/23, 2:32 am - James: Bruce in the 1000 club
22/11/23, 2:32 am - Gerrard: Owen is better than Bergkamp
22/11/23, 2:32 am - James: He that annoying French fella that does punditry in the states?
22/11/23, 2:33 am - Gerrard: Kuyt is better than Saka
22/11/23, 2:33 am - Gerrard: That guy that cracks onto the female presenter to mask the fact he's in the closet
22/11/23, 2:34 am - Gerrard: Mascherano is better than Patrick Vieira
22/11/23, 2:35 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Rafa is better than Wenger too
22/11/23, 3:24 am - James: CL winner?
22/11/23, 3:24 am - James: CL winner?
22/11/23, 3:25 am - Dave: Smells like meth in here
22/11/23, 3:26 am - Gerrard: Not with Livo, but Luis Garcia is so - better than Saka
22/11/23, 3:27 am - Gerrard: One guy wins, one guy gets lots of draws
22/11/23, 3:29 am - Dave: Meeetthhhhhh
22/11/23, 3:32 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 🪇
22/11/23, 3:32 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 he has won more
22/11/23, 3:33 am - Gerrard: Xabi Alonso is better than Fabregas
22/11/23, 3:53 am - Dave: I’ve heard he’s klopps replacement
22/11/23, 3:54 am - Jono: https://x.com/FabrizioRomano/status/1727146552295366725?s=20
22/11/23, 3:54 am - Jono: Brazilian cops are next level
22/11/23, 3:54 am - Gerrard: Stop dreaming bro, Madrid needs him more
22/11/23, 3:55 am - Dave: Liverpool dreaming big https://www.givemesport.com/liverpool-keeping-close-eye-on-xabi-alonso-as-club-plans-ahead/
22/11/23, 3:55 am - Gerrard: Carlo is gone end of year, Klopp got two more in him
22/11/23, 3:56 am - Gerrard: Stop smoking meth in here bro
22/11/23, 3:56 am - Gerrard: Be realistic

22/11/23, 4:02 am - Jono: Red card for Joelinton
22/11/23, 5:06 am - James: These mid ex players getting slightly big jobs is a joke
22/11/23, 5:07 am - James: Cunt can try his luck in the championship first and see how he gets on
22/11/23, 5:07 am - James: Look at Gerrard now. Joker
22/11/23, 5:08 am - James: If he spends ten years at Varpool with one title and one CL with the best Varpool team in 30 plus years is that a success?
22/11/23, 5:10 am - Dave: Right. Ten years later getting 98th minute draws against Luton town and klopp doing quadruple fist pumps. It’s actually embarrassing
22/11/23, 5:11 am - Dave: Maybe that’s what Alonso wants. The saudi dream. Flop spectacularly at a top job then get scooped up by the blood money
22/11/23, 5:11 am - James: They sell their players for blood money
22/11/23, 5:12 am - James: If it wasn't for the blood money they wouldn't have signed anyone in the summer
22/11/23, 5:12 am - Dave: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/world/europe/xabi-alonso-leverkusen.html
22/11/23, 5:13 am - James: 'the peoples club (should be killing other fans club)' should have taken a stand and rejected all approaches for hendo and fabino
22/11/23, 5:13 am - James: But the scouser inside of them couldn't say no to the wonga
22/11/23, 5:13 am - Dave: Would have been the moral thing to do
22/11/23, 5:14 am - Dave: But no, it’s all a facade surprise surprise
22/11/23, 5:17 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 bro you gotta stand up for yourself, can't let Rodders mug you off like that
22/11/23, 5:58 am - James: https://x.com/Watch_LFC/status/1726982015420137719?s=08

22/11/23, 6:11 am - James: Proper dick
22/11/23, 6:11 am - James: I assume they didn't have var?
22/11/23, 6:12 am - James: Shouldn't have even been a yellow
22/11/23, 6:13 am - Jono: No VAR for some reason lol
22/11/23, 7:04 am - Gerrard: Why haven't we talked about the England game?
22/11/23, 7:05 am - Jono: They couldn’t beat half a country right?
22/11/23, 7:06 am - Gerrard: Played their best 11 too
22/11/23, 7:08 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cz6J2U0Msys/?igshid=NGEwZGU0MjU5Mw==
Also fun seeing the City fan react so badly to this
22/11/23, 7:10 am - James: Who's Australia's next game against? Yemen?
22/11/23, 7:10 am - Jono: Not Malta
22/11/23, 7:11 am - James: Salah is the only player that gets in that team 💯
22/11/23, 7:12 am - James: Good, you'd lose 😂
22/11/23, 7:12 am - Gerrard: Don't be deflecting like Rodders, you're better than him <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 7:12 am - James: Come on you're not seriously saying any Varpool players get into the treble winners team

22/11/23, 7:15 am - James: Or how many get in varpools team?
22/11/23, 7:15 am - Gerrard: I tell you what though you put Livo forwards and GK on City's mids and defence then you got the greatest team ever
22/11/23, 7:15 am - James: Just Saliba and Odegaard?
22/11/23, 7:16 am - James: Alvarez and Haaland walk into varpools team imo
22/11/23, 7:16 am - Gerrard: That's cool, I'm just saying
22/11/23, 7:17 am - Gerrard: Different dynamics
22/11/23, 7:17 am - James: Citehs defence is ridiculous
22/11/23, 7:17 am - James: As individuals

22/11/23, 7:19 am - James: I miss the days of two strikers
22/11/23, 7:19 am - James: Shearer needed Bellamy
22/11/23, 7:19 am - Gerrard: Two fags and a old school poacher
22/11/23, 7:19 am - James: But Ferdinand and Shearer worked
22/11/23, 7:19 am - James: Cole and Yorke
22/11/23, 7:20 am - James: Fowler and Owen
22/11/23, 7:20 am - James: 4-4 fucking 2

22/11/23, 7:26 am - James: And got to a uefa final
22/11/23, 7:26 am - Gerrard: All they did was trick a bunch of Aussies into feeling like shit for 10yrs
22/11/23, 7:26 am - James: I wonder how many ex Leeds fans are here
22/11/23, 7:26 am - James: I know two Leeds fans still
22/11/23, 7:26 am - James: Aussies
22/11/23, 7:27 am - James: Wasn't Smith a gun up front then went to manure. Scored a few then they went and signed Rooney

@61452662705 he says that if VAR was around in early 2000s then Arsenal wouldn't have been invincibles
22/11/23, 7:37 am - James: Got to see him play left back at Wembley for England. Was sat right on the side line.

22/11/23, 7:37 am - James: He was a Chelski rent boy

22/11/23, 7:38 am - Gerrard: His book is a good read, at least for us Livo fans
22/11/23, 7:38 am - James: Not so much when he played us though. He scored wordies
22/11/23, 7:38 am - James: *worldies
22/11/23, 7:38 am - Gerrard: I got halfway on Steve McManaman's book

22/11/23, 7:39 am - James: Can't spell his name
22/11/23, 7:39 am - Gerrard: I got up to the bit where Madrid turn into the gallacticos
22/11/23, 7:39 am - James: Kinkladze
22/11/23, 7:39 am - Gerrard: When that owner came in
22/11/23, 7:40 am - Gerrard: Told the manager what starting 11 he'd be playing each gane
22/11/23, 7:40 am - Gerrard: Game
22/11/23, 7:40 am - James: Unreal. Figo, Ronaldo and loads others I can't think of right now
22/11/23, 7:40 am - Gerrard: Macca would be subbed on every game at 50mins lol
22/11/23, 7:41 am - James: Like Owen

22/11/23, 7:41 am - James: One Englishman who worked out there
22/11/23, 7:41 am - James: And Beckham
22/11/23, 7:41 am - James: Less said about Woodgate the better
22/11/23, 7:42 am - Gerrard: Poor Macca, scored a worldie in the CL final then next year Zidane scored his worldie in the CL final
22/11/23, 7:42 am - James: Oh yeah Zidane
22/11/23, 7:42 am - James: Fuuuck
22/11/23, 7:42 am - Gerrard: You don't know game bro
22/11/23, 7:42 am - Gerrard: Can't believe you missed him
22/11/23, 7:42 am - James: You know who was severely underrated at real?
22/11/23, 7:43 am - Gerrard: Hate mussies
22/11/23, 7:43 am - James: Guti
22/11/23, 7:43 am - Gerrard: Was gonna say

22/11/23, 7:44 am - James: And Batistuta
22/11/23, 7:44 am - Gerrard: I still hate their captain CB from when Spain knocked Ireland out of the euros on pens.
22/11/23, 7:45 am - James: Udinese and Fiorentina easy to get
22/11/23, 7:45 am - James: Raul not so much
22/11/23, 7:47 am - Gerrard: The year of that u21 euro/world cup when United signed Ronaldo and Livo signed Sinama Pongolle and Anthony LeTallec, that LeTallec had like 200 potential and turned into Messi
22/11/23, 7:52 am - James: Kramaric was mine. Ballon d'Or every season. Got him at 18
22/11/23, 7:52 am - James: Then in reality, this unknown guy gets signed by Leicester and he's turned out crap
22/11/23, 7:52 am - Gerrard: What happened to Bojan eh
22/11/23, 7:52 am - James: Stoke wasn't it
22/11/23, 7:52 am - Gerrard: Next Messi <This message was edited>

22/11/23, 8:30 pm - Gerrard: Reaching

22/11/23, 9:51 pm - James: Liverpool care so much about Newcastle they lobby other clubs to change rules mid season. That's three times now in two years @14244893404
22/11/23, 9:51 pm - James: Although arsenal are no better and part of it, it's still Liverpool and Spurs as the instigators
22/11/23, 9:53 pm - James: Too bad he got cancelled for speaking his mind 😢 mad sky sacked him
23/11/23, 4:05 am - Dave: We’re nothing to do with anything. Just an honest club doing honest things
23/11/23, 4:05 am - Dave: Who is this geordie lad? He’s so unbelievably dense
23/11/23, 4:06 am - Dave: Does he represent Newcastle fans @61452662705? He’s like AFTV Robbie on steroids
23/11/23, 5:29 am - James: No idea, it's Gez's favourite show. Just clickbate crap for 16 year olds
23/11/23, 5:30 am - James: Nobody is as dense as Robbie and the Aftv crew
23/11/23, 5:47 am - Dave: I beg to differ, these lads are a new breed. Especially that geordie
23/11/23, 5:49 am - James: Racist

23/11/23, 5:59 am - James: Everton the real peoples club of Merseyside 😃
23/11/23, 5:59 am - James: God bless Nottingham Forest
23/11/23, 5:59 am - James: Three cheers to Burnley
23/11/23, 6:00 am - James: Maybe if 'the big' six didn't try and breakaway and make an anticompetitive league heeeey
23/11/23, 6:00 am - James: 🇸🇦
23/11/23, 6:00 am - Gerrard: All clubs but Everton have connections to the middle east, and Everton are just hoping to sell to an Arab
23/11/23, 6:01 am - James: Varpool raised £60m from the Arabs on sales of their deadwood
23/11/23, 6:01 am - Dave: Does that mean we should all support Everton then? 🤔
23/11/23, 6:02 am - James: Merseyside is blue
23/11/23, 6:02 am - Dave: Na, just astute businessmen Liverpool
23/11/23, 6:02 am - Gerrard: It all kinda speaks for itself
23/11/23, 6:03 am - Dave: Picking up world class prodigy’s like nunez for pennies
23/11/23, 6:04 am - James: Amazing scouting network
23/11/23, 6:04 am - James: Still spending that coutinho money
23/11/23, 6:04 am - James: Not gone over apparently
23/11/23, 6:04 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 I think Jimmity is a bit confused about the difference between selling players to oil money and selling the soul of the club to oil money tyrant murderers.
23/11/23, 6:04 am - Gerrard: 🤷🏼‍♂️
23/11/23, 6:05 am - James: So Jezzy beef is with Mike Ashley!?
23/11/23, 6:05 am - James: I think Varpool should try form a new league again
23/11/23, 6:05 am - James: Where you get elite euro football every season no matter what and nobody can be relegated or promoted
23/11/23, 6:06 am - James: Varsenal main sponsor is Emirates!?
23/11/23, 6:06 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 do you think he talks about City and Chelsea differently than he does about Newty and their money?
23/11/23, 6:07 am - James: Rattled
23/11/23, 6:07 am - Dave: Remember when the kit turned Saudi green and the Geordie’s didn’t even blink an eyelid. Just bathed in the blood of homosexuals and oppressed women
23/11/23, 6:07 am - Dave: “It’s us vs them”
23/11/23, 6:08 am - James: Arsenal paid to be in the first division didn't they?
23/11/23, 6:08 am - James: And Varpool outspent everyone to get out of league 2 😂
23/11/23, 6:08 am - James: 'legacy' clubs
23/11/23, 6:09 am - James: Where it allllllll started...
23/11/23, 6:09 am - Gerrard: If they acknowledged it then people wouldn't think of them as massive hypocrites
23/11/23, 6:09 am - James: So rattled
23/11/23, 6:09 am - Dave: We don’t talk about that
23/11/23, 6:09 am - James: Rattled over something that hasn't happened 😂
23/11/23, 6:09 am - Dave: Global company, have to abide by global standards
23/11/23, 6:09 am - Dave: Different
23/11/23, 6:10 am - Gerrard: It's ok to talk about the past when it suits his argument
23/11/23, 6:10 am - Dave: To having the dictator himself at your helm
23/11/23, 6:10 am - James: We can talk about arsenal actually paying to be in division 1?
23/11/23, 6:10 am - James: Pot kettle
23/11/23, 6:10 am - Dave: Thought nothing mattered before 1990 🤷🏼‍♂️
23/11/23, 6:10 am - Gerrard: I thought it was before Newty qualified for the CL
23/11/23, 6:11 am - James: Two cheating clubs
23/11/23, 6:11 am - James: One of which has a disgusting past of violence and murder
23/11/23, 6:11 am - James: 🤢
23/11/23, 6:11 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 I respected Jimmy more when Steve Bruce was at the wheel
23/11/23, 6:11 am - James: Always everyone else's fault...
23/11/23, 6:11 am - Dave: Newcastle, city or Chelsea?
23/11/23, 6:12 am - Gerrard: Definitely the Newty owners
23/11/23, 6:15 am - James: Funny a lot of other teams fans and owners liked those days too <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 6:16 am - Dave: Humble and down to earth
23/11/23, 6:16 am - James: Didn't mind the old 'related parties sponsorships' when big Mike was paying the club zero pounds for sports direct sponsorship...
23/11/23, 6:16 am - James: Was alllll gravy then
23/11/23, 6:16 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 how much less money would the Newty owners need to have before Jimmity would care about them murdering people?
23/11/23, 6:17 am - Gerrard: Throw some numbers out
23/11/23, 6:17 am - James: I don't recal PIF murdering anyone 🙄
23/11/23, 6:17 am - Dave: A pound less than Mike Ashley had
23/11/23, 6:18 am - James: Can you hear that?
23/11/23, 6:18 am - James: Sounds like a rattle
23/11/23, 6:19 am - Gerrard: What about City money?
23/11/23, 6:19 am - James: 🔥🇸🇦🔥
23/11/23, 6:21 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 Chelsea money, murder still ok?
23/11/23, 6:22 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 or is it just any kind of success?
If they were in 18th right now, murder still ok?
23/11/23, 6:23 am - Dave: I think sleeping at night knowing they’re not getting relegated is worth the blood
23/11/23, 6:24 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 how much money or success for Hilter as the owner?
23/11/23, 6:27 am - Dave: Top 6 would do it
23/11/23, 6:29 am - Gerrard: Zeig Heil for the Toon
23/11/23, 6:30 am - Dave: “The rest of the league only have a problem with hitler because it’s Newcastle, they just feel threatened”
23/11/23, 6:31 am - Gerrard: I guess this is how Poland and France felt

23/11/23, 11:46 pm - Gerrard: Put money on a 0-0 draw, I dare you
23/11/23, 11:48 pm - James: Or a pen for Varpool
23/11/23, 11:49 pm - James: Any draws?
23/11/23, 11:49 pm - James: Or do citeh usually score at least 3
24/11/23, 12:33 am - Gerrard: Couple blows outs, I blame Mane
24/11/23, 12:33 am - Gerrard: We got their number in Europe though 💦
24/11/23, 12:35 am - Gerrard: 5 draws
24/11/23, 12:41 am - Gerrard: And cups
24/11/23, 12:42 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 you gonna get on first half City fulltime Liverpool?
24/11/23, 2:41 am - James: Did you make those lists

@61452662705
24/11/23, 3:24 am - Gerrard: Home, Away, Neutral
24/11/23, 3:46 am - Gerrard: @61413646755 going to be banned from CL 😱

24/11/23, 4:48 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 @61404060785 I heard the vote was to just ban it for this one transfer window then they'd have enough time to put proper regulations in for next year, why would it need proper regulations if there's nothing dodgey about it?
24/11/23, 4:51 am - James: What was the issue before this January?
24/11/23, 4:52 am - James: #corrupt
24/11/23, 5:03 am - James: Why was there no regulations before 😂
24/11/23, 5:04 am - James: It'll never pass. Unluckyyyyy
24/11/23, 5:04 am - James: 🇸🇦
24/11/23, 5:07 am - James: Bent. Rory Jennings is quite clearly bent
24/11/23, 5:09 am - Gerrard: First time someone tried insider trading there weren't any rules about it
24/11/23, 5:10 am - James: If only that were true. It isn't.
24/11/23, 5:10 am - James: Also, Newcastle don't want neves
24/11/23, 5:10 am - James: This was all a ploy to see if dummies were spat
24/11/23, 5:12 am - James: All this corrupt / anti competition ideals from the premier league cartel
24/11/23, 5:12 am - James: Spearheaded by Varpool and Spurs 😂
24/11/23, 5:14 am - James: https://youtu.be/H9CZplnfvvk?feature=shared
24/11/23, 5:15 am - Dave: Smelly draw written all over it
24/11/23, 5:15 am - Dave: Or you’re getting smashed
24/11/23, 5:17 am - Dave: We want him lol
24/11/23, 5:17 am - James: He isn't leaving saudi
24/11/23, 5:18 am - James: Why would they buy all these top players to loan them to Newcastle 😂
24/11/23, 5:18 am - James: Varpool should be worried about Salah going in Jan
24/11/23, 5:18 am - James: He wants saudi
24/11/23, 5:18 am - James: No loyalty
24/11/23, 5:21 am - Dave: Going to have to acca that now
24/11/23, 5:21 am - Dave: FFP loophole?
24/11/23, 5:21 am - James: They want to build their league
24/11/23, 5:21 am - James: And they will
24/11/23, 5:22 am - Dave: He’s 100% going. Don’t think it’s anything to do with loyalty, liverpool would be stupid not to cash in
24/11/23, 5:22 am - James: They'll be a top five league by the time the wc comes in 2030 or whatever it is
24/11/23, 5:22 am - Dave: Salah is still world class at 31. Take the 100m+ and run
24/11/23, 5:23 am - James: They'd be 10th without salah
24/11/23, 5:23 am - James: If he goes they're fucked
24/11/23, 5:23 am - James: Definition of a one man team (plus Alisson I suppose)
24/11/23, 5:24 am - Dave: Alisson and salah most instrumental for sure. Those two players would make it into any team in the world imo
24/11/23, 5:27 am - James: You can only have two loan players in a team and pay wages
24/11/23, 5:28 am - James: The cartel are that upset Newcastle could loan neves 😂
24/11/23, 5:28 am - James: Hilarious
24/11/23, 5:28 am - James: Fell for it
24/11/23, 5:51 am - Dave: Didn’t know that
24/11/23, 5:58 am - James: Who are the best teams
24/11/23, 6:01 am - Dave: Arsenal
24/11/23, 6:02 am - Dave: Chelsea and Newcastle looking pretty balanced across the pitch as well
24/11/23, 6:04 am - Dave: Graph is kind of discredited seeing how good Chelsea look on it. Throw it in the bin
24/11/23, 6:06 am - James: Chelsea aren't as bad as you think
24/11/23, 6:06 am - James: They have a high xg
24/11/23, 6:06 am - Dave: I don’t think they’re terrible, they get themselves in some great attacking positions
24/11/23, 6:06 am - Dave: Just Jackson couldn’t hit a barn door until recently
24/11/23, 6:07 am - Dave: Sterling is having a great season now as well
24/11/23, 6:07 am - James: A team that has cacaido, Enzo and Lavia can't be shite
24/11/23, 6:08 am - Dave: But they’re still conceding a fair few  goals which is why I take this chart with a pinch of salt
24/11/23, 6:14 am - James: They've got Varpools A list midfield targets tbf
24/11/23, 6:14 am - Gerrard: 44msgs
24/11/23, 6:14 am - Gerrard: Jimmy rattled?
24/11/23, 6:14 am - James: Just got rattly in here @14244893404
24/11/23, 6:15 am - James: Can you hear it
24/11/23, 6:16 am - Gerrard: Jimmy still rattled from yesterday
24/11/23, 6:16 am - Gerrard: I'm sorry for picking on you Jimmity
24/11/23, 6:16 am - Gerrard: Forgive me?
24/11/23, 6:17 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 don't think he'll forgive or forget
24/11/23, 6:18 am - James: @14244893404 don't fall for Jezzabelle's games
24/11/23, 6:19 am - James: He's getting you onside because of the citeh game tomorrow
24/11/23, 6:19 am - James: Doesn't want the grief
24/11/23, 6:19 am - James: Terrified...
24/11/23, 6:19 am - James: Remember how badly he's treated you these past few weeks
24/11/23, 6:20 am - James: Calling you racist and a cunt
24/11/23, 6:20 am - James: He said you were alcoholic yank with no friends apart from liam
24/11/23, 6:21 am - Dave: That true @61409710717?
24/11/23, 6:22 am - Gerrard: It's win meh tomorrow, win and we're amazing, lose and it's expected
24/11/23, 6:23 am - Gerrard: Never said you had no friends
24/11/23, 6:23 am - James: Said Liam is your only friend @14244893404
24/11/23, 6:23 am - Gerrard: Bloody likeable ain't ya
24/11/23, 6:23 am - James: Not denying the alchy part either
24/11/23, 6:23 am - James: Cop. Out.
24/11/23, 6:24 am - James: Varpool mate at work said Varpool would win tomorrow
24/11/23, 6:24 am - Gerrard: Thank god, I was wondering what your mate thinks <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 6:25 am - James: He's a scouser so I listen to him more than anyone in here
24/11/23, 6:25 am - James: 'livo' hey @14244893404 😂
24/11/23, 6:25 am - James: Livo games on cant
24/11/23, 6:25 am - Gerrard: Oh that's why you're the way you are then
24/11/23, 6:25 am - James: Oh someone is a rattle

24/11/23, 6:26 am - Gerrard: Sorry if that hurt you
24/11/23, 6:26 am - James: The rattling doesn't hurt me all good hun
24/11/23, 6:26 am - Dave: Just an alcoholic and a yank ✅
24/11/23, 6:26 am - Gerrard: Already had one of them
24/11/23, 6:26 am - James: Which...
24/11/23, 6:27 am - Dave: Clearly a wank, boring bastard won’t go out for a beer
24/11/23, 6:27 am - James: Too much effort
24/11/23, 6:27 am - Gerrard: I'm driving now so can't have one
24/11/23, 6:27 am - James: He who dares
24/11/23, 6:28 am - Dave: Never stopped you dropping tabs
24/11/23, 6:28 am - Gerrard: Don't drink drive
24/11/23, 6:28 am - Dave: Live a little
24/11/23, 6:28 am - James: Wank and wheel
24/11/23, 6:28 am - Gerrard: Got the tabs in me luggage
24/11/23, 6:29 am - James: So much substance abuse in this chat
24/11/23, 6:29 am - Dave: Psychejezlic mckeown, the mushroom diaries
24/11/23, 6:29 am - Dave: This chat drives me to it
24/11/23, 6:29 am - Gerrard: Better than coke and that thing we're not allowed to joke about yet
24/11/23, 6:30 am - James: I got mushrooms
24/11/23, 6:30 am - James: Ounce
24/11/23, 6:30 am - James: When we went to watch a game at cheers @61404060785 and I wanted to kick on and have a whisky
24/11/23, 6:31 am - James: Jez said it was home time at 11:30pm
24/11/23, 6:31 am - James: Wanted to get back and shove a tab up his arse no doubt
24/11/23, 6:31 am - Gerrard: Think it was more about the company
24/11/23, 6:32 am - James: Wow
24/11/23, 6:32 am - Dave: At least he’s honest

Low key loving this from Nunez even after all his fuck ups.
25/11/23, 3:53 pm - Gerrard: @61422023136 two draws, Everton points deduction...... Pep 🪇

25/11/23, 7:41 pm - Dave: Great result for everyone this morning. Cheers liverpool 🍻
25/11/23, 7:41 pm - Dave: Anyone watching ramsdale’s redemption game?
25/11/23, 7:41 pm - Dave: 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
25/11/23, 10:44 pm - Liam: Newy fucked up chelsea

25/11/23, 10:51 pm - Gerrard: Forget about AAron, everyone was slagging off Trent where I was watching then it got very quiet after he scored
25/11/23, 11:02 pm - Dave: Impressive considering injuries. Chelsea been looking decent recently
25/11/23, 11:04 pm - Dave: Yeah I don’t think rammers really pulled it back and convinced the haters by the end of the game. Poor cunts confidence looked so shaken
25/11/23, 11:05 pm - Dave: This message was deleted
25/11/23, 11:15 pm - Pero: What happened here ? Pep having a whinge?
25/11/23, 11:17 pm - Jono: The irony of TAA telling the crowd to shoosh
25/11/23, 11:19 pm - Jono: Darwin is a man of the people
25/11/23, 11:25 pm - Pero: Sounds like a few low blows were given from both sides
26/11/23, 12:02 am - Gerrard: Not enough, no one kicking anyone til Endo came on
26/11/23, 12:08 am - Dave: Heard there was another “was the ball in or out” controversy as well @61409710717 @61404060785
26/11/23, 12:52 am - Gerrard: Can't remember, when was it?
26/11/23, 12:52 am - Jono: I fell in and out sleep watching it so missed it too
26/11/23, 2:33 am - James: Cheating again @14244893404?
26/11/23, 2:33 am - James: I saw Citehs disallowed goal. Was so soft. Never a foul on enderson
26/11/23, 2:34 am - James: 3 academy debuts and a 17 year old got MOTM
26/11/23, 2:34 am - James: How did Ramsgate get on @14244893404 didn't see the match?
26/11/23, 3:12 am - Gerrard: I agree never a foul on Ederson
26/11/23, 3:12 am - James: Alisson init
26/11/23, 3:12 am - James: Same same
26/11/23, 3:13 am - Gerrard: Stop messaging and come out your house
26/11/23, 3:13 am - James: Where are you
26/11/23, 3:14 am - Gerrard: Out front
26/11/23, 4:04 am - James: Can't concentrate
26/11/23, 4:43 am - Gerrard: Arteta ruined him
26/11/23, 4:43 am - James: Just trying to be like pep
26/11/23, 4:43 am - James: Joe Hart was never the same
26/11/23, 4:53 am - Gerrard: Poisonous just like Pep
26/11/23, 4:53 am - Gerrard: Alienating players that are no longer useful to him
26/11/23, 4:57 am - James: https://youtu.be/iQS0_JfJf5I?feature=shared
26/11/23, 4:57 am - James: @61409710717 citeh robbed?
26/11/23, 4:57 am - Gerrard: Nah fair game
26/11/23, 4:58 am - Gerrard: They should scored a few more real goals if they were good, Livo played bad for long periods
26/11/23, 4:58 am - Gerrard: Poor champions
26/11/23, 5:02 am - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/shorts/dpUDOARj_rM?si=hyQsMQ77iJeeAaud
26/11/23, 5:29 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 watch the Livo highlights and watch City players appealing for a handball that hit the back of a defender's thigh, fucking desperate dogs
26/11/23, 5:32 am - Gerrard: Jesus check out Sterling's freekick
26/11/23, 5:40 am - Jono: This infuriated me
26/11/23, 5:41 am - Jono: We were so bad first half and they didn’t capitalize enough. We played bad enough to be 2 or 3 down
26/11/23, 5:42 am - Jono: Even 2nd half we hung in and just waited to pounce like we did
26/11/23, 5:45 am - James: See, I thought it was great live then from the replay I thought Pope should have done better. It wasn't right in the corner. Looks like he thought it was going over
26/11/23, 5:46 am - James: Saw that. Alvarez and Silva were pants yesterday
26/11/23, 5:46 am - Gerrard: Up and over so close though, not bhed
26/11/23, 5:48 am - Jono: Was magic. Takes a certain technique to get that dip so close. Pope was thinking going left given the wall was gonna protect him on the right
26/11/23, 5:48 am - Jono: Wtf was Silva doing
26/11/23, 5:48 am - Dave: I watched like 15 mins of the first half when I was up with the baby and thought Silva was class. Looked like a city domination. 

Did liverpool do the usual? Shit first half and pile the pressure on in the second?
26/11/23, 5:48 am - Jono: Thiago Silva I mean
26/11/23, 5:48 am - James: I was drifting in and out of sleep
26/11/23, 5:49 am - Dave: I’m talking about bernado
26/11/23, 5:49 am - Jono: We didn’t play well at all. Disjointed as ever and looked like a side who hadn’t trained together regularly in over a week
26/11/23, 5:49 am - James: Was going to pass accross the goal but saw Isak and then shit the bed
26/11/23, 5:49 am - James: Was hilarious
26/11/23, 5:49 am - James: Two goals in one minute
26/11/23, 5:50 am - Dave: Did isak play well @61452662705
26/11/23, 5:50 am - Jono: But somehow we hung in there and got the result. I’m actually stoked we could play that bad against city and almost get the 3 points
26/11/23, 5:50 am - James: And Reece James trying to out pace Gordon was also funny with the red
26/11/23, 5:50 am - Jono: Gives me hope of some sort Citeh will shit the bed
26/11/23, 5:50 am - Dave: I don’t think he’s as good as he thinks he is
26/11/23, 5:50 am - James: Rusty but scored. Miley was class
26/11/23, 5:50 am - Dave: I’m hopeful as well
26/11/23, 5:51 am - Dave: Cracks starting to appear with these charges looming. Well, that’s my hope
26/11/23, 5:51 am - James: His sister is better
26/11/23, 5:51 am - Dave: Pics or it’s not true
26/11/23, 5:52 am - James: Anthony Gordon turned out great didn't he
26/11/23, 5:52 am - James: Wonder if Everton fans still feel we over paid
26/11/23, 5:52 am - James: She scores bangers
26/11/23, 5:53 am - James: Hideous looking thing though
26/11/23, 5:58 am - Gerrard: Pep made no subs and City were exhausted in the second
26/11/23, 5:59 am - James: Yeah what was that about
26/11/23, 5:59 am - Gerrard: 🪇
26/11/23, 6:00 am - James: There was nobody on their bench
26/11/23, 6:00 am - James: Only attacking player was bobb
26/11/23, 6:03 am - James: Dunno if they're in the highlights @61409710717 but Joelinton managed to better his miss against Dortmund
26/11/23, 6:04 am - Jono: They are. Shocker
26/11/23, 6:11 am - Dave: I’d love him at arsenal. Right menace isn’t he
26/11/23, 6:13 am - James: Who'd have thought he'd actually begin to develop under a proper coach once he left that clown show of a club
26/11/23, 6:13 am - Dave: Lightning quick and got that council estate dog in him 😂
26/11/23, 6:21 am - Gerrard: Lol saw that
26/11/23, 7:51 am - Pero: Very happy for Kai to do this 👏
26/11/23, 10:28 am - Jono: https://x.com/scousecowboyy/status/1728432136229699707?s=48

Gez here’s the reason. Darwin doesn’t forget
26/11/23, 10:44 am - James: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12790009/Gary-Neville-insists-Liverpool-NOT-title-contenders.html?ico=topics_pagination_mobile
26/11/23, 10:47 am - Gerrard: What wank is this?
26/11/23, 10:47 am - Gerrard: Boo Gary, hate him again
26/11/23, 10:48 am - Jono: He said “did you like the goal?” Had to be related to Pep’s fuckery last year.
26/11/23, 10:49 am - Jono: If anything, how shit we were to get a point is more a note to say City can be dethroned.
26/11/23, 3:46 pm - Dave: <Media omitted>
26/11/23, 5:34 pm - Jono: Garnacho’s just scored the goal of the season
26/11/23, 5:34 pm - Louie: Need to update this post
26/11/23, 5:35 pm - Louie: Better than Rooney’s against city
26/11/23, 5:36 pm - Jono: On par but looked just as hard at first glance
26/11/23, 5:37 pm - Louie: Solid connection and not loopy
26/11/23, 5:37 pm - Jono: I agree with the commentator
26/11/23, 5:39 pm - Dave: Wow what a goal
26/11/23, 5:41 pm - Dave: Instantly top 3 bicycle kicks
26/11/23, 5:43 pm - Dave: Maybe second best behind zlatans?
26/11/23, 5:55 pm - Louie: Maybe not second, but definitely up there. Gudjohnsen scored a mad one for Chelsea. Also Van Basten scored a similar one to Garnacho.
26/11/23, 6:08 pm - Dave: I think it’s better than gudjohnsens. And Ronaldo’s against juve 😬 garnacho put it in the opposite top corner from the edge of the box
26/11/23, 6:08 pm - Dave: Actually may be one of the best goals of all time, can’t stop watching it 😂
26/11/23, 6:22 pm - Louie: I like those two because they hit them closer to the centre of the goal, so they would have had less time to react. But true with Garnacho’s one, had to hit it well to get it across and past the keeper.
26/11/23, 6:23 pm - Louie: Not sure if I can watch the rest of this game. Everton could be up 3-1 if they could finish.
26/11/23, 6:23 pm - Louie: Hopefully they show some sportsmanship and let United win off Garnacho’s goal.
26/11/23, 6:28 pm - Louie: They just did a side by side of Garnacho and Rooney bicycles on Optus sport with the same camera angle. The technique is almost identical.
26/11/23, 11:23 pm - Gerrard: 4 messages in a row from @61413646755, United must have won
26/11/23, 11:24 pm - Gerrard: How did Everton's protest go?
26/11/23, 11:36 pm - James: Looks like Everton battered manure but somehow lost 3-0
26/11/23, 11:38 pm - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
26/11/23, 11:38 pm - Gerrard: Typical from both of them
26/11/23, 11:39 pm - Gerrard: At least Ange is getting found out
26/11/23, 11:39 pm - Gerrard: Kamikaze Ange
26/11/23, 11:39 pm - Pero: Even the forwards play high line with ange, hatrick of offside goals
26/11/23, 11:43 pm - Pero: Commentators saying manu didn't have 1 attempt on goal between the garnarcho screamer in the 3rd and martial dive in the 55th
26/11/23, 11:43 pm - James: When rashford scored the pen it was their first shot at goal since their opener in the second minute
26/11/23, 11:49 pm - James: Pickford only has little arms though so a normal sized goalkeeper may have saved it <This message was edited>
26/11/23, 11:56 pm - Louie: It was all part of the strategy, let them think they can attack then hit them on the counter. Ten Hag is a genius.
26/11/23, 11:56 pm - Louie: He concedes so many long shots
27/11/23, 12:43 am - Dave: I’m seeing all the “United’s run of form” posts popping up all over my social media feeds now. 

And I had a United fan mate text me earlier saying “Arsenal can never attract world class talent like Garnacho because you’re a small club”. So United must “be back”. This season is so exciting 😂
27/11/23, 1:10 am - Gerrard: He's right about Arsenal being a small club
27/11/23, 2:24 am - Dave: Comedian
27/11/23, 2:27 am - Gerrard: Arteta?
27/11/23, 2:28 am - Dave: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 2:29 am - Dave: You’re witnessing history and you don’t even know it. Arteta is special ❤️
27/11/23, 2:32 am - Gerrard: Way more losses and way more money, isn't it?
27/11/23, 2:32 am - Gerrard: More goals against
27/11/23, 2:33 am - James: 😲
27/11/23, 2:33 am - Gerrard: Was that table supposed to look good for Arteta???
27/11/23, 2:33 am - Gerrard: 5 more wins for 20 more losses?
27/11/23, 2:33 am - Gerrard: Sorry, 14 more losses
27/11/23, 2:33 am - James: I know right 😂
27/11/23, 2:34 am - Gerrard: 30 more goals conceded for 14 more goals against
27/11/23, 2:38 am - Dave: Different era of the prem
27/11/23, 2:38 am - Dave: A lot less competitive then
27/11/23, 2:41 am - Dave: And liverpool still couldn’t win fuck all. Most of Liverpools trophies come from the 70s. James said that doesn’t count
27/11/23, 2:51 am - Gerrard: Then why are you using this information comparing the two in some shit way of trying to make Arteta relevant? <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 2:51 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 am I going insane here? <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 2:52 am - Dave: You only just realising
27/11/23, 2:53 am - Dave: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 2:53 am - Gerrard: Awesome save Rodder 👍🏻
27/11/23, 6:45 am - James: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 6:56 am - Gerrard: Lol fair play
27/11/23, 6:56 am - Gerrard: Invincibles*

27/11/23, 7:09 am - James: Lost Terry Venables today. That's a really shit one 😔
27/11/23, 7:10 am - James: Look at Villa now 😲
27/11/23, 9:10 am - Liam: Fucking drunk
27/11/23, 9:39 am - James: Wow
27/11/23, 9:40 am - James: Another club legend treated like shit @61409710717
27/11/23, 9:40 am - Gerrard: Expected no less
27/11/23, 6:47 pm - Dave: No way. Sad
27/11/23, 6:54 pm - Dave: Emery is a good manager. Part of a managers job is to click with the owners as well though, clearly he wasn’t very likeable if arsenal didn’t back him like they back arteta. 

Emery’s a bit like Klopp, another great manager but the owners won’t back him because he’s an insufferable cunt

28/11/23, 6:14 am - James: https://x.com/TrollFootball/status/1729266626875527360?s=08
28/11/23, 7:17 am - Dave: Banger
28/11/23, 7:21 am - Dave: 8th wonder of the world his misses
28/11/23, 7:22 am - Pero: All in this season only in 13 games played ?
28/11/23, 7:22 am - James: Maybe they'd be top if they had Isak instead
28/11/23, 7:23 am - James: It's enough to fill a careers worth. All in 13 games and at the age of, what, 23?
28/11/23, 7:37 am - Dave: The 100m “next suarez”? Surely not
28/11/23, 7:38 am - Pero: Every 2nd/3rd game he producers a worldie miss
28/11/23, 8:21 am - James: The Mexican Timo Werner!
28/11/23, 9:11 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 9:12 am - Gerrard: Lovely racism, shame he wasn't this against Newty
28/11/23, 9:13 am - Gerrard: Davey Euros Rodders
28/11/23, 9:14 am - Gerrard: Arsenal could win something if they had Nunez
28/11/23, 9:27 am - James: Still going on about that jesus
28/11/23, 9:27 am - James: Suppose it's the only big result you've had all season tbh
28/11/23, 9:28 am - Gerrard: I say the draw against City was a bigger deal than beating lowly Newty with 10 men
28/11/23, 9:29 am - Gerrard: So much Typing Davey Euros <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 9:30 am - Dave: Celebrating draws, what happened to you boys 😭💀
28/11/23, 9:30 am - Gerrard: Just levels to everything, I didn't celebrate but it's even less for beating Newty
28/11/23, 9:32 am - Gerrard: But Arsenal wouldn't know about beating Newty
28/11/23, 9:32 am - James: LOL
28/11/23, 9:32 am - James: So your best result all season is a draw
28/11/23, 9:32 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 9:33 am - James: Who you beat this season!?
28/11/23, 9:33 am - Gerrard: I like the comebacks earlier in the season
28/11/23, 9:33 am - James: Yeah against shit teams well done
28/11/23, 9:33 am - James: Who you beat?
28/11/23, 9:33 am - Gerrard: Newty shit?
28/11/23, 9:33 am - Gerrard: Glad we agree
28/11/23, 9:33 am - Gerrard: Love when we're on the same page
28/11/23, 9:34 am - James: Arsenal, Citeh, Chelsea, PSG, Manure all beaten
28/11/23, 9:34 am - James: Who you beat?
28/11/23, 9:34 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 9:34 am - James: @14244893404 who they beat?
28/11/23, 9:34 am - Gerrard: I don't think you can count the City game
28/11/23, 9:35 am - Gerrard: Wasn't it the cup and youngins?
28/11/23, 9:35 am - James: Honestly this like Chelsea fans giving it the biggun after drawing against a knackered citeh and beating 9 man spurs
28/11/23, 9:35 am - James: Put in their place at the weekend
28/11/23, 9:35 am - Gerrard: Lol
28/11/23, 9:35 am - James: Who ya beat @61409710717?
28/11/23, 9:35 am - Gerrard: Who did you lose to @61452662705 ?
28/11/23, 9:36 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 it's after 10 games, are we allowed to look at the table yet?
28/11/23, 9:37 am - Dave: You. That’s it?
28/11/23, 9:37 am - James: 'they're back'
28/11/23, 9:37 am - Dave: I’m not joking
28/11/23, 9:37 am - James: Serious
28/11/23, 9:37 am - James: ?
28/11/23, 9:38 am - Dave: Who else is there?
28/11/23, 9:38 am - Gerrard: Thought Livo had more than one win
28/11/23, 9:38 am - Gerrard: 💯
28/11/23, 9:38 am - Gerrard: Glad you said it
28/11/23, 9:39 am - Dave: Klopp quadruple fist pumping the fans at Luton away after snatching a point in the 98th minute
28/11/23, 9:39 am - James: Um Luton!?
28/11/23, 9:39 am - James: Wolves!?
28/11/23, 9:39 am - Dave: Highlight of the season so far is a point at Etihad
28/11/23, 9:39 am - James: Brentford!?
28/11/23, 9:40 am - Dave: As my liverpool mate over here said.. “tactical masterclass by Klopp, Brentford are no joke”
28/11/23, 9:40 am - James: Stop it
28/11/23, 9:41 am - Dave: When do their fixtures get difficult @61452662705, they’ve got Fulham and Sheffield next 😩
28/11/23, 9:43 am - James: Let's see how they get on when the inevitable injuries begin to pile up and the fixtures get hard
28/11/23, 9:44 am - James: For a team that's 'back' how are they only five points ahead of 'newty' who have 11 players out and have had a hard as nails fixture list so far?
28/11/23, 9:46 am - James: @14244893404 how kind has their fixture list been!?
28/11/23, 9:46 am - James: Corruption at the premier league!?
28/11/23, 9:46 am - Dave: Mid December onwards the fixture difficulty starts ramping up. One key injury away from a total implosion imo. Alisson, slob or Salah out and they’re cooked
28/11/23, 9:47 am - James: They couldn't do it with 11 out
28/11/23, 9:47 am - James: Just Salah out would cook them
28/11/23, 9:47 am - Dave: They did openly admit they wanted a more competitive season, certainly got it
28/11/23, 9:47 am - Dave: They’d be relegation battlers
28/11/23, 9:48 am - James: @14244893404 look at this amazing Ange and spurs team. We're 3 points off them now and they've got citeh next
28/11/23, 9:48 am - James: Guess what, 2 injuries and the fixtures got hard after they spanked varpool
28/11/23, 9:51 am - Dave: Couldn’t be happier. A mate of mine was saying Ange is the real deal and didn’t need to worry about injuries  as spurs have way more depth than Arsenal. Two injuries and they’re shite again. 3 L on the bounce
28/11/23, 9:52 am - James: 2 key players and shite
28/11/23, 9:52 am - James: Good managers get the best out of what they have
28/11/23, 9:52 am - James: Ange sucks
28/11/23, 9:57 am - James: @14244893404 I think if you ended the season now, varpools biggest result of the season was beating Newcastle
28/11/23, 10:01 am - Dave: https://x.com/unplayablesport/status/1662711500321030146?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA

28/11/23, 12:19 pm - Jono: I don’t get it

28/11/23, 9:32 pm - Jono: Isak was Nuñez at St James*
28/11/23, 10:57 pm - Dave: That’s not a penalty. Wow. Newcastle about to get robbed
28/11/23, 11:00 pm - James: Not a pen at all
28/11/23, 11:01 pm - Jono: Qatar clearly paying more than the Saudis
28/11/23, 11:03 pm - Dave: Payback for robbing us a few weeks ago
28/11/23, 11:10 pm - James: Not really nothing happened in that game where rules weren't followed. You're still going on about it a month later 😉
28/11/23, 11:10 pm - James: Ball hit his body before his elbow. Not a handball
28/11/23, 11:10 pm - Jono: At least you’ve got Europa
28/11/23, 11:11 pm - Dave: You were robbed
28/11/23, 11:11 pm - Dave: Like we were
28/11/23, 11:11 pm - James: So proud of the boys ⚫⚪
28/11/23, 11:11 pm - James: At least we never embarrassed ourselves like Varpool last season @14244893404
28/11/23, 11:11 pm - James: That Madrid game was bantzzz
28/11/23, 11:12 pm - Dave: p00ned
28/11/23, 11:12 pm - Jono: You still going on about last season
28/11/23, 11:12 pm - Jono: Makes a month ago feel like yday
28/11/23, 11:13 pm - James: Na we can talk about this season. Who have you beaten so far?
28/11/23, 11:13 pm - James: @61409710717 wouldn't answer
28/11/23, 11:13 pm - James: Yeah but Varpool fans LOVE talking about the past
28/11/23, 11:13 pm - James: It's what they're known for
28/11/23, 11:14 pm - James: That an killing other teams fans and robbing their own teams players
28/11/23, 11:14 pm - James: But ya know 🫠
28/11/23, 11:15 pm - Jono: I’ll let you can release that anger you feel on here
28/11/23, 11:21 pm - James: Not answering the question 😭
28/11/23, 11:21 pm - Gerrard: Hello, what's up?
28/11/23, 11:22 pm - Gerrard: @61404060785 is Jimmity Cricket lashing out because Newty didn't perform well?
28/11/23, 11:22 pm - Jono: He’s asking a question he can find the answer to on the PL website
28/11/23, 11:23 pm - Gerrard: He doesn't like checking there because he might get a glance at the table
28/11/23, 11:23 pm - Liam: I thought it was a pen. Ball hit his arm.
28/11/23, 11:24 pm - Jono: Newcastle beat Arsenal and apparently that opens the pathway to ask who we’ve beaten as some sort of gloat mechanism
28/11/23, 11:24 pm - James: I want to know what Varpool fans see as a big result against a good team?
28/11/23, 11:24 pm - James: What really big good team have Varpool beaten this season?
28/11/23, 11:25 pm - James: Rich coming from a Liverpool fan. You beat a team like Brentford and you're in the hunt for the title 🤣
28/11/23, 11:25 pm - Gerrard: @61404060785 fuck he's struggling this morning eh
28/11/23, 11:26 pm - Jono: I can feel the anger
28/11/23, 11:26 pm - Jono: DV incoming
28/11/23, 11:27 pm - Gerrard: He told me he wanted Newty to throw this morning's game so they finish last and go out of Europe so they can focus on the league.
28/11/23, 11:27 pm - Gerrard: Taking a play out of the Arsenal handbook
28/11/23, 11:34 pm - Jono: Just to cheer up Jimmy even more
28/11/23, 11:36 pm - Liam: So this season it’s a clear handball.
28/11/23, 11:36 pm - Jono: This recommendation was done end of last season
28/11/23, 11:37 pm - Liam: VAR karma
28/11/23, 11:38 pm - Dave: So handball this year, but not handball next year?
28/11/23, 11:38 pm - Dave: So Newcastle out this year? And Newcastle out next year because they don’t qualify @61404060785 ?
28/11/23, 11:38 pm - Liam: Out of CL, straight into Europa
28/11/23, 11:39 pm - Jono: Lol - Hopefully they recover vs Mancs this weekend so they can claim it another big scalp LFC hasn't beaten this season
28/11/23, 11:40 pm - Jono: And lead us on the big scalp ladder
28/11/23, 11:40 pm - James: Yeah who ya beat?
28/11/23, 11:40 pm - Jono: Reminds me of the moral England Ashes triumph
28/11/23, 11:46 pm - Jono: If it makes you feel any better Jimmy I still think you'll make it through

PSG will draw or lose vs Dortmund
28/11/23, 11:46 pm - Jono: And all you gotta do is win
28/11/23, 11:47 pm - Dave: PSG really haven’t been impressive this tournament have they
28/11/23, 11:49 pm - Liam: They are shit
28/11/23, 11:59 pm - James: Dortmund can play the kids can't they?
29/11/23, 12:12 am - Dave: What you think of rammers in for pope James?
29/11/23, 12:13 am - Gerrard: Improvement
29/11/23, 12:14 am - Liam: Ya, rammers and newy would be a good match up. Mid
29/11/23, 12:15 am - Dave: Top ball distribution and better shot stopper
29/11/23, 12:16 am - Gerrard: He's a PL top 5 keeper
29/11/23, 12:17 am - Dave: Eddie Howe will be salivating over signing him
29/11/23, 12:17 am - Dave: Maybe one for liverpool then? Now alisson getting on a bit
29/11/23, 12:18 am - Dave: 80m for you 😋
29/11/23, 12:35 am - James: Pope was class today
29/11/23, 12:35 am - James: Rammers is shit
29/11/23, 12:35 am - James: Got the bottle virus in him
29/11/23, 12:35 am - James: Can't cure that
29/11/23, 12:37 am - James: He wants to move to a club that wins the big trophies regularly
29/11/23, 12:40 am - Liam: Your new keeper mate
29/11/23, 12:41 am - James: Raya is shit as well
29/11/23, 12:41 am - Dave: Wish him all the best, it’ll be nice for him up there. Back to his neck of the woods
29/11/23, 12:43 am - Dave: Can’t wait to see his old man on the true Geordie podcast
29/11/23, 1:17 am - James: Howe and the players are so classy even after that injustice. Arteta could really learn something from watching this
29/11/23, 1:20 am - Jono: Fair play award incoming
29/11/23, 1:20 am - Jono: You’ll claim that @61452662705
29/11/23, 1:20 am - Jono: Like Spurs claim the Audi cup
29/11/23, 1:21 am - Jono: I actually agree with Alan Shearer’s reaction. Fuck the system. Nothing will change by respecting the refs decision.
29/11/23, 1:21 am - James: Proud ❤️⚫⚪❤️
29/11/23, 1:22 am - Jono: In fact I would respect it if VAR was scrapped
29/11/23, 1:22 am - James: Still fighting in the group of death
29/11/23, 1:22 am - James: I thought the ref was excellent
29/11/23, 1:22 am - James: Until someone changed his mind in the var
29/11/23, 1:46 am - Jono: He looked at the screen too. Was his call in the end
29/11/23, 2:14 am - James: They never stick with their onfield decisions once they get the call
29/11/23, 2:15 am - Liam: https://youtu.be/y17X3gTTCXQ?si=PLUpIe9uVEaDX5BB
29/11/23, 2:23 am - Dave: Exactly. I thought he was great up until that point as well. He didn’t even agonise over it, instantly called the pen
29/11/23, 2:36 am - James: So much more classier than Varsenal fans
29/11/23, 2:36 am - James: And arteta
29/11/23, 6:20 am - Gerrard: I just think Newtle fans don't understand the current laws of the game
29/11/23, 7:32 am - Dave: “Newtle”. New variation, like this one. Kind of sounds like an insect
29/11/23, 7:58 am - James: I thought Jez was better than this. Such a shame
29/11/23, 7:58 am - James: So proud of the boys ⚫⚪
29/11/23, 8:27 am - Gerrard: Thank you.
I almost wrote the full name then realised and was too lazy to start again. So just deleted letters until I was happy with it, I thought insect too.
29/11/23, 8:28 am - James: What's livo
29/11/23, 8:28 am - James: Livopoo
29/11/23, 8:34 am - James: Livopoo with poonez up top
29/11/23, 8:35 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 I take back the comment about you being off this week
29/11/23, 9:04 am - James: "Africa, Europe er Antarctica I'm calling on you" 🫵
29/11/23, 10:12 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/Ivu165dyxwY?si=l-yx4kM7-352Bdxl
29/11/23, 10:13 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 is that you?
29/11/23, 10:18 am - Liam: ▶️ Watch this reel https://www.facebook.com/share/r/6AERa3tgt5nQ1BaX/?mibextid=jaSYs6

29/11/23, 11:34 am - James: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 12:03 pm - Jono: Swings and roundabouts
29/11/23, 12:14 pm - James: One decision was proved correct the other wasn't 😬
29/11/23, 12:18 pm - Liam: Newy don’t really belong in the CL,  so it’s not a huge deal, it won’t change any kind of significant outcome in this competition.

Scum
29/11/23, 7:41 pm - Dave: “It’s CHEATING we was robbed, it’s making us cry watching it, we deserved something out of tonight, we’re finishing second!!!” “You can stick your VAR where the sun doesn’t shine and that baldy referee I wish I could see him so I could *BEEEP*” 
 
- Newcastle fans and howe are so classy after this injustice, Arsenal could really learn something from us.

29/11/23, 8:39 pm - Jono: Crisis
29/11/23, 8:39 pm - Jono: Yanited as good as gooooone
29/11/23, 9:14 pm - Dave: HAVERTZ UNLOCKED BABY
29/11/23, 9:17 pm - Liam: Havertz ❤️
29/11/23, 9:17 pm - Jono: If Bayern are smart here they let Copenhagen win and then United are officially out
29/11/23, 9:26 pm - Dave: Payback lens you cunts
29/11/23, 9:28 pm - Liam: Top of the league, looks like we are topping our CL group with a game to spare. Mikel 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻
29/11/23, 9:28 pm - James: Weirdest fan base in the world
29/11/23, 9:29 pm - James: Have other teams constantly living rent free in your heads 😂
29/11/23, 9:29 pm - Dave: For celebrating 4-0 up in 25 mins in biggest club tournament in the world? Salty after yesterday aren’t you
29/11/23, 9:30 pm - James: No I'm proud of my boys
29/11/23, 9:30 pm - James: I just think Arsenal fans are fucking weird
29/11/23, 9:34 pm - Dave: I just listened to a geordie crying on a talk show saying he wants to murder a referee and you’re calling us weird?
29/11/23, 9:35 pm - James: I think you're really weird
29/11/23, 9:35 pm - James: I'm so proud of how my teams manager and players acted at the final whistle. Arteta and Arsenal are everything I don't want my club to become ❤️
29/11/23, 9:50 pm - Dave: 5-0 at half time. What a statement
29/11/23, 9:56 pm - James: You sound like Jono & Jez. Don't be like them
29/11/23, 11:08 pm - Pero: Gunners !! 💪💪
29/11/23, 11:11 pm - Dave: Why you sending this
29/11/23, 11:11 pm - Dave: Record breakers, what a return
29/11/23, 11:12 pm - Dave: Arteta, genius
29/11/23, 11:12 pm - James: You're flexing over beating a team that belongs in Varpool Europa group ffs
29/11/23, 11:12 pm - James: Shameful
29/11/23, 11:14 pm - Liam: Topped the group
Top of the league 
It’s a good week to be a gunner ❤️ @61422023136 @14244893404
29/11/23, 11:18 pm - Dave: Top of everything we touch. We’re not flexing, don’t need to. Facts over feelings. Tell your geordie mate bawling his eyes out on the radio that
29/11/23, 11:30 pm - James: So loud atm. When quiet time?
30/11/23, 12:08 am - Gerrard: @61413646755 OH-nana.... <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 12:10 am - Louie: Poor decisions for the first two goals. Disappointing after his solid performance against Everton.
30/11/23, 12:10 am - Louie: I guess we’ll just need to concentrate on winning the league now
30/11/23, 12:39 am - James: About the same chance as Varsenal and Varpool
30/11/23, 12:40 am - Louie: But we have no more cups to distract us
30/11/23, 12:40 am - James: At least you can be realistic about your chances and not deluded like the majority in here
30/11/23, 12:40 am - James: FA
30/11/23, 12:40 am - Gerrard: Remember when United crushed @61452662705 dreams
30/11/23, 12:41 am - Gerrard: @61413646755 did you know about Jimmity traveling over to watch the league cup loss in person?
30/11/23, 12:41 am - James: Remember when Slippy G said 'we don't let this slip now' and then hilariously slipped over allowing demba ba to kill varpools title charge?
30/11/23, 12:42 am - James: How far back we going, I have more?
30/11/23, 12:42 am - Jono: No way, did he?
30/11/23, 12:42 am - James: @61413646755 did you know these fags have never seen their team play a competitive match in person 😂
30/11/23, 12:42 am - Jono: I have 👍🏼
30/11/23, 12:43 am - Jono: At Upton Park no less 😅
30/11/23, 12:43 am - Jono: What a journey
30/11/23, 12:44 am - Louie: I’m in the same boat, unless that time United came to Australia for a friendly tour counts. The Man U U21s Vs A-League all stars was a competitive game 😂
30/11/23, 12:44 am - James: Yeah but you're not a cunt so all good
30/11/23, 12:44 am - Jono: Cunt is a strong word
30/11/23, 12:44 am - James: Jez can't even wake up to watch his team play on television
30/11/23, 12:44 am - James: Not in Australia
30/11/23, 12:45 am - James: It may be endearing
30/11/23, 12:46 am - Gerrard: Me twice
30/11/23, 12:46 am - Jono: Was also had Rickie Lambert up top so I really took one for the team that day
30/11/23, 12:46 am - Gerrard: I sat in the kop for one too <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 12:47 am - James: In fantasy land?
30/11/23, 12:47 am - James: These made up memories
30/11/23, 12:47 am - James: From a vlog you watched on YouTube or something
30/11/23, 12:52 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 still rattled from PSG penalty
30/11/23, 12:53 am - Jono: 🪇
30/11/23, 12:55 am - Dave: Can’t believe you went there 👀💀
30/11/23, 12:58 am - Dave: In three continents ❤️🤍
30/11/23, 12:59 am - Liam: Got mugged off 😂
30/11/23, 1:01 am - Gerrard: If you count friendlies we got three continents too
30/11/23, 1:01 am - Dave: Where’s your third?
30/11/23, 1:01 am - Gerrard: USA
30/11/23, 1:01 am - Dave: 100% can count friendlies
30/11/23, 1:01 am - Gerrard: Boston baby
30/11/23, 1:01 am - Gerrard: In Fenway Park
30/11/23, 1:02 am - Gerrard: 1 in US
3 in Aus
2 at Anfield
30/11/23, 1:02 am - Dave: You should come over here if Liverpool play at SoFi. Best stadium I’ve been to
30/11/23, 1:02 am - Dave: Proper fan
30/11/23, 1:03 am - Gerrard: I dare say that I've probably seen Liverpool win games live more that Jimmy has seen Newty win games live.
30/11/23, 1:03 am - Liam: Oh god, you’ve seen more games than most English Liverpool fans
30/11/23, 1:04 am - Dave: Definitely followed your team to more continents than him. Super fan
30/11/23, 1:04 am - Liam: Most English Liverpool fans, haven’t even been to Liverpool
30/11/23, 1:05 am - Dave: Same with Newcastle fans. Most of them are southerners that just wanted to get a shirt with shearer on the back
30/11/23, 1:05 am - Gerrard: Does Newtle play anywhere else except GordieTown and Headchop Arabia?
30/11/23, 1:06 am - Gerrard: Can't respect that
30/11/23, 1:12 am - James: All of you are gay
30/11/23, 6:23 am - James: https://x.com/TrollFootball/status/1729985932617793884?s=08
30/11/23, 6:36 am - James: Most English people don't want to go to Liverpool lol
30/11/23, 6:37 am - James: It's like going to Iraq or Gaza
30/11/23, 6:37 am - James: To watch friendlies 😂
30/11/23, 6:37 am - James: No
30/11/23, 6:37 am - James: Incorrect
30/11/23, 6:38 am - Dave: No what?
30/11/23, 6:38 am - James: No
30/11/23, 6:38 am - James: Not coming to LA again ever
30/11/23, 6:39 am - James: What a shirt that 95/96 one is ❤️
30/11/23, 6:39 am - Gerrard: Fuck did Jimmy just wake up
30/11/23, 6:40 am - James: I reckon I've seen all your clubs live more times than you have combined
30/11/23, 6:41 am - Gerrard: Guess you've not had good football to watch supporting Newtle so you had to
30/11/23, 6:42 am - Gerrard: Looks like Alf
30/11/23, 6:42 am - James: Must have been a treat for you and Jonny to watch the elite teams these last few days
30/11/23, 6:42 am - James: Who you guys got tomorrow morning? Nobody will be watching fyi
30/11/23, 6:43 am - James: Is it Toulouse!?!
30/11/23, 6:43 am - James: That French team you lost to last time out?
30/11/23, 6:43 am - Dave: Dreaming
30/11/23, 6:43 am - Gerrard: I don't watch CL, only watched the legitimate penalty for PSG and then Onana's fuck ups
30/11/23, 6:44 am - James: Don't watch any footy really do you
30/11/23, 6:45 am - James: Just a bunch of spastics 'reactions' on YouTube
30/11/23, 6:45 am - James: Like one of those losers who watches other people play video games on twitch 😂😂😂
30/11/23, 6:45 am - Gerrard: Sounds 🪇
30/11/23, 6:46 am - James: *it's like they're actually my friends and I'm really there watching with them*
30/11/23, 6:47 am - Gerrard: Started the weekend early

30/11/23, 7:19 pm - Dave: Havertz man. Arteta has unlocked him, he’s the man. Best 65m ever spent ❤️
30/11/23, 8:41 pm - Liam: Everything arteta touches turns to gold
30/11/23, 9:02 pm - Dave: It really does. Haven’t felt like this about a manager since prime Wenger 20 years ago ❤️
30/11/23, 9:02 pm - Jono: That was my face when you said Eddie unlocked the Gamblor
30/11/23, 9:53 pm - James: Is Gamblor a side quest in world of warcraft or something?
30/11/23, 10:01 pm - Dave: Just switched the game on
30/11/23, 10:02 pm - Dave: Fuck me those LASK fans are noisy. Can’t hear a single liverpool fan over the away fans 😂😂😂
30/11/23, 10:02 pm - James: Standard
30/11/23, 10:04 pm - Dave: Where is LASK?
30/11/23, 10:07 pm - Dave: Salah is so elite. What a pen
30/11/23, 10:14 pm - James: Varpool strikes again?
30/11/23, 10:15 pm - James: Why you watching that shite
30/11/23, 10:15 pm - James: In Europe somewhere apparently
30/11/23, 10:23 pm - Gerrard: Still raging
30/11/23, 10:33 pm - Liam: Ice cold 🥶 what a player
30/11/23, 10:40 pm - Dave: Got it on in the background, liverpool playing well
30/11/23, 10:55 pm - Gerrard: Irish Alisson cleansheet
30/11/23, 11:00 pm - Liam: Liverpool into the Knockout stage. Well done, true pedigree in Europe.
30/11/23, 11:03 pm - Gerrard: Without leaning on the first team too much, result.
30/11/23, 11:03 pm - Liam: Brilliant management of the squad.
30/11/23, 11:03 pm - Gerrard: Good news for Arsenal too, in the same pot as Bayern so don't have to face them in the next round.
30/11/23, 11:04 pm - Gerrard: You can't just overwork the top 11 players then cry that you've got so many injuries as an excuse.
30/11/23, 11:07 pm - James: This chat is getting worse

1/12/23, 12:13 pm - Liam: Mikel is his apprentice. Why do you think we are top of everything. 
Moyes 🐐
1/12/23, 5:40 pm - Dave: Better than Klopp as well 🥹 Moyes 🐐
2/12/23, 3:02 pm - Gerrard: Does he get an award for most goal contributions?

2/12/23, 10:02 pm - Pero: Saw the highlights this morning and besides the little mistake that costed us the goal, it looked like champagne football. So good to watch 😍😍
2/12/23, 11:16 pm - Jono: https://x.com/theredmentv/status/1731039243227541710?s=48

2/12/23, 11:31 pm - Liam: I think you boys will be alright. I think Spain and Croatia will top the group.
2/12/23, 11:31 pm - James: @61413646755 happy with just the 1-0?
2/12/23, 11:34 pm - Dave: He’s fucking world class mate, unreal player.
2/12/23, 11:35 pm - Dave: Easy group for us
2/12/23, 11:36 pm - Dave: Group B definitely group of death, croatia will pull that off though. Italy are woeful
2/12/23, 11:36 pm - Liam: Ya that group Is pathetic, Southgate will still fuck it up somehow
2/12/23, 11:37 pm - Dave: Didn’t know championship players could score goals like that
2/12/23, 11:37 pm - Dave: Southgate masterclass, scrape past Slovenia on goal difference or something
2/12/23, 11:38 pm - Liam: 5 at the back, Hendo in midfield
2/12/23, 11:38 pm - Louie: Yeh could have been worse.
2/12/23, 11:38 pm - Dave: Can’t wrap my head around how good the build up play was for our two goals, totally world class. Should have been 4-5 nil, we had a few off the woodwork and line clearances
2/12/23, 11:38 pm - James: Ten Hag was honest for once in the post match presser
2/12/23, 11:39 pm - Dave: Big man Maguire bossing the back
2/12/23, 11:39 pm - James: What is up with Rashford @61413646755?
2/12/23, 11:39 pm - James: His attitude was terrible
2/12/23, 11:44 pm - Louie: He’s always been mentally fragile and his form is on and off with what’s happening around him. The drama with Sancho/Ten Hag and also his ex-fiancée is probably messing with him this season. Such a shame for someone who’s a local academy product whose gifted with pace, dribbling and shooting power.
2/12/23, 11:45 pm - Louie: Don’t think he will recover in time for this season.
2/12/23, 11:48 pm - James: Perfect for Southgate and England then
2/12/23, 11:50 pm - Louie: Rashford won’t even make the Euro team. Gordon and Grealish will be ahead of him. Hopefully the summer off will give him time to sort himself out.
2/12/23, 11:59 pm - Dave: Oh southgate will be picking him alright, he’s one of the chosen ones
3/12/23, 12:01 am - Dave: Gordon could bang in 40 goals this season and old Gareth would still pick rashford over him 😂 We won’t win a bean with him as our manager
3/12/23, 12:05 am - James: Exactly this
3/12/23, 12:05 am - James: Gordon Kane and Saka
3/12/23, 12:06 am - James: Sterling deserves a recall as well tbf
3/12/23, 12:06 am - James: That McBurnie for sheff is a bit of a dick
3/12/23, 12:07 am - Dave: Thought he was done, made a real resurgence this season hasnt he
3/12/23, 12:07 am - Dave: Similar to son. Amazing how new managers just unlock players you thought were washed
3/12/23, 12:46 am - Pero: Hopefully this doesn't turn into another rapist in the making
3/12/23, 1:02 am - James: He has all the hallmarks
3/12/23, 1:05 am - Pero: Yeh greenwood had game time then started to get benched, then he was having  issues with his gf. We all know what transpired after that
3/12/23, 1:09 am - James: Issues like his Mrs didn't feel like having sex one particular evening. Got smacked up
3/12/23, 1:10 am - Louie: Nah Rashfords has an OBE, he’s a saint
3/12/23, 1:10 am - Louie: Do you know he fed the poor and hungry in England during COVID?
3/12/23, 1:12 am - Pero: What a bitch
3/12/23, 1:12 am - Pero: Respect! He is one of the good ones then
3/12/23, 1:13 am - James: Stand with mason
3/12/23, 1:14 am - James: Nah I don't buy into those who do charity stuff publically. He's a cunt
3/12/23, 2:20 am - Gerrard: A lot of messages from Jimit, Newty must have won
3/12/23, 2:34 am - James: Jez is here! Must have come down off of his tab from last night
3/12/23, 2:36 am - Gerrard: Just edibles last night.
So Newty only won 1-0 against a terrible team, good result.
3/12/23, 2:36 am - Gerrard: Oh shit, Nick Pope injured.
3/12/23, 2:38 am - Liam: https://x.com/arsenalanoop/status/1731085310178496723?s=48&t=2H6WZBte1Bbl316U4Om7qA
3/12/23, 2:38 am - Liam: Does not give a fuck
3/12/23, 2:41 am - James: Arsenal fans trying to make the game about them somehow 😂
3/12/23, 2:42 am - James: Like Varpool fans ffs
3/12/23, 2:42 am - James: Close enough 😵‍💫
3/12/23, 3:03 am - Dave: That lad couldn’t give less of a fuck could he <This message was edited>
3/12/23, 3:03 am - Dave: You’re both irrelevant mate, no offence
3/12/23, 3:08 am - James: @61409710717 Varsenal fluke a win against the mighty Wolverhampton and he's givin it the biggin
3/12/23, 3:21 am - Gerrard: Like you do?
3/12/23, 3:25 am - James: Who you beat this season?
3/12/23, 3:26 am - Gerrard: Majority of the teams we've played
3/12/23, 3:26 am - Gerrard: Hey you guys have too now, congrats
3/12/23, 3:26 am - Louie: To be fair, Dubravka would have saved it, if it didn’t deflect off Maguire
3/12/23, 3:26 am - Jono: Did Maguire deny an equaliser late in the game by getting in the way? Fuck me that’s peak Madge there
3/12/23, 3:27 am - Jono: Oh just saw the above
3/12/23, 3:27 am - Jono: There’s no way that’s getting saved
3/12/23, 3:27 am - Jono: He’s fucked it again haha
3/12/23, 3:28 am - Jono: Madge 4eva
3/12/23, 3:28 am - Jono: Favourite non LFC player
3/12/23, 3:28 am - Jono: By some distance
3/12/23, 3:30 am - James: What's been your biggest win?
3/12/23, 3:30 am - James: He would have saved it. He still nearly did when slab head got in the way
3/12/23, 3:31 am - James: Tbf slab was alright. Kept manure in it
3/12/23, 3:37 am - Gerrard: CL final?
What's Newty's?
3/12/23, 3:37 am - Gerrard: #Justice4Harry
3/12/23, 4:53 am - Dave: Look mate, you focus on united, spuds and Brighton in your end of the table and we’ll focus on the big boys up here. We have a big game at Anfield coming up 😬
3/12/23, 5:33 am - Jono: lol
3/12/23, 6:03 am - Gerrard: No way the Newty 11 worth that much
3/12/23, 6:04 am - James: This season. Oh you're in the past. Again.
3/12/23, 6:06 am - Gerrard: Can't look back further than a week, that'll be living in the past
3/12/23, 6:06 am - James: 60 years. 30 years. 5 years...
3/12/23, 6:08 am - James: Look back this season for your biggest win and let us know
3/12/23, 6:09 am - Gerrard: I told you I can't look back more than 1 day, that'll be living in the past - big no no
3/12/23, 6:53 am - Dave: https://x.com/theredmentv/status/1730952700139798789?s=46&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA


Welbeck > Salah 🤷🏼‍♂️
3/12/23, 8:11 am - James: Who knows. Welbeck wasted a lot of his career at shit teams like Arsenal and Man Utd
3/12/23, 2:14 pm - Liam: Not at Anfield, thank god.
3/12/23, 3:03 pm - James: Sunderland v Newcastle is the headliner
3/12/23, 3:04 pm - James: Two var clubs won't be selected for TV coverage. Sorry lads
3/12/23, 3:26 pm - James: The two sides of Trent in two minutes lol
3/12/23, 3:27 pm - Liam: Should be a good game, really looking forward to it
3/12/23, 3:27 pm - Liam: Test arteta against an elite manager
3/12/23, 3:28 pm - James: Free kick was an OG. Hit the bar then hit leno
3/12/23, 3:32 pm - James: Nice dive nunez
3/12/23, 3:32 pm - James: Nice hair too
3/12/23, 3:50 pm - James: Varpool are so chaotic
3/12/23, 5:30 pm - Jono: Just saw the goals 😱 even Endo with a screamer
3/12/23, 5:37 pm - Jono: https://x.com/nocontextkeaneo/status/1731337953589289444?s=48

3/12/23, 9:46 pm - Jono: City dropping points again at home

@61452662705 your dream match up
3/12/23, 10:55 pm - Jono: Yep
3/12/23, 10:56 pm - Gerrard: Nice to see there's no favouritism and they're just shit across the board
3/12/23, 10:59 pm - Gerrard: <Media omitted>

3/12/23, 11:25 pm - You changed this group's icon
4/12/23, 12:23 am - Gerrard: Has anyone checked on Pep?
4/12/23, 12:24 am - Jono: Jimmy’s face when LFC form is identified as good against inferior teams
4/12/23, 1:50 am - Pero: Pep also looks like he is gonna pop soon
4/12/23, 2:05 am - Liam: That newy
4/12/23, 2:05 am - Liam: ?
4/12/23, 2:05 am - Dave: Yeah, killing it
4/12/23, 2:06 am - Liam: Wow, what the chances James fly’s across the world and they lose to United
4/12/23, 2:07 am - James: Yeah, who you beat this season? <This message was edited>
4/12/23, 2:20 am - James: Congrats on scraping past Fulham last night ❤️
4/12/23, 2:20 am - James: They the teams you beat? Finally an answer 😂
4/12/23, 2:23 am - Gerrard: He's straight in lol, not even self aware about all the messages this morning
4/12/23, 2:27 am - James: We beat arsenal 1-0 at home too ☺️
4/12/23, 2:28 am - Jono: You're red hot at home....
4/12/23, 2:34 am - Gerrard: He's not self aware about anything he posts lol
4/12/23, 3:10 am - James: https://x.com/nicola_cookson/status/1731430200041185681?s=08
4/12/23, 3:11 am - James: Klippy fawning over Sir Eddie! Whaaaa 🫨
4/12/23, 3:20 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 hey I was saving this question for when old mate is in a better mood but seems like that's never gonna happen, hoping as an Englishman who's been to a lot of games there that you can share some insight.

All these clubs that haven't done anything in their history, what do their fans sing about?
4/12/23, 3:22 am - James: https://x.com/manutdf2/status/1731487176297251317?s=08
4/12/23, 3:27 am - James: Unlike Australia, England has a rich history and culture. So there's a lot of rivalry between cities, towns and counties. 

That's 80% of what most songs are about. Culture. I wouldn't expect you Aussies to understand this since you've never experienced it.

But it's OK.
4/12/23, 3:28 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 I knew this would trigger him
4/12/23, 3:28 am - James: What's a Liverpool song?
4/12/23, 3:28 am - Gerrard: We won it 6 times
4/12/23, 3:28 am - James: Livarpool, Livarpool...
4/12/23, 3:29 am - James: It was a library at 3-2. As usual
4/12/23, 3:29 am - James: Arsenal fans shite as well
4/12/23, 3:29 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 @61404060785 what's more than Rattled?
4/12/23, 3:30 am - Dave: 😮😮😮
4/12/23, 3:31 am - James: Blaydon Races, Coming Home, Toon Toon!?
4/12/23, 3:31 am - James: Where you source this?
4/12/23, 3:31 am - James: We are the Saudi Boys ❤️❤️❤️
4/12/23, 3:36 am - Dave: Most pathetic shit I’ve ever heard
4/12/23, 3:37 am - Liam: Newy got battered 10 men Liverpool
4/12/23, 3:37 am - James: Varsenal got battered by Newcastle 😬
4/12/23, 3:37 am - Dave: You’re fucking Geordie’s, what you bumming Saudis for
4/12/23, 3:37 am - Dave: Sold the soul
4/12/23, 3:39 am - Liam: You on the coke again
4/12/23, 3:43 am - Jono: Cooked
4/12/23, 3:46 am - Jono: "Don't mention the war"
4/12/23, 3:47 am - Gerrard: Game over, brilliant 🤣
4/12/23, 3:48 am - Dave: “Can’t hit a barn door”
4/12/23, 3:49 am - Gerrard: Was about to say
4/12/23, 3:50 am - James: Wow what a piece of shit you are
4/12/23, 3:52 am - Liam: You know what happen last time
4/12/23, 3:54 am - Gerrard: Look at him trying to fight back, cute
4/12/23, 3:54 am - James: When oztech celebrated when you left because you were shit at your job? Or when you told Dave's wife everyone hated her and stuck your tongue down her ear 😳
4/12/23, 3:54 am - James: Hey I don't know if you were shit at your job. Ask Gez?
4/12/23, 3:55 am - James: That deffo not the oztech party Liam wasn't invited
4/12/23, 3:56 am - James: @14244893404  has Liam had over two pints I'd be careful
4/12/23, 3:56 am - James: He'll be sending flowers come the morning
4/12/23, 3:56 am - Liam: I love oztech
4/12/23, 3:57 am - James: Yeah but they didn't like you
4/12/23, 3:57 am - James: Ask @61409710717
4/12/23, 3:57 am - Liam: That ok
4/12/23, 3:57 am - Liam: I love oztech
4/12/23, 3:58 am - Liam: How do EPS feel about you?
4/12/23, 3:58 am - James: I'd probably also be fond of a company that kept me on even though I was shit at my job. (apparently)
4/12/23, 3:58 am - James: @61409710717 knows more about it
4/12/23, 3:58 am - James: Ask @14244893404 about it too because they used to talk a lot about it
4/12/23, 3:59 am - Gerrard: Feels like when parents are fighting in front of the kids, but never has been because Newty suck and someone's lashing out.
4/12/23, 3:59 am - James: @61409710717 aaand what's this about you shagging relatives
4/12/23, 3:59 am - James: Ask @14244893404 about that one too <This message was edited>
4/12/23, 3:59 am - James: Anyway...
4/12/23, 4:00 am - James: Enjoy your day and drinks guys
4/12/23, 4:00 am - Gerrard: He's hard quit lol
4/12/23, 4:00 am - James: You shagging cousins or something Jez!?
4/12/23, 4:01 am - Gerrard: Someone post that gif of that blinking surprised guy, can't find it
4/12/23, 4:08 am - James: *Dave panicking*
4/12/23, 4:09 am - Liam: Text gez in the background
4/12/23, 4:09 am - Gerrard: That's it
4/12/23, 4:09 am - Liam: Saying you a cunt
4/12/23, 4:09 am - Liam: lol
4/12/23, 4:23 am - Dave: You’re a cunt @61452662705
4/12/23, 4:25 am - James: Bunch of bullys in here
4/12/23, 4:57 am - Liam: @61409710717 Just to confirm I shouldn’t ask for my job back!
4/12/23, 4:57 am - Gerrard: I'd take you
4/12/23, 4:58 am - Gerrard: Thiago too but you'd both be too expensive
4/12/23, 5:02 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 I thought he said goodbye earlier
4/12/23, 5:02 am - James: Like driving past a car accident. Just having a little look see
4/12/23, 5:02 am - Gerrard: Thought this was an out
4/12/23, 6:51 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/JNAwjty31t0?si=7ZfzuwAxRO2_1-6W

4/12/23, 10:05 am - Shaun: <Media omitted>
4/12/23, 10:02 pm - Jono: Pope out for 5 months 
4/12/23, 11:23 pm - James: Dubravka 😊
4/12/23, 11:24 pm - Jono: https://x.com/skysportsnews/status/1731753545488122290?s=48

“Some senior players don’t know what their running for” 🤣
4/12/23, 11:24 pm - James: How long is Alisson out for? That Irish lad is a bit shit
4/12/23, 11:25 pm - Jono: Won us a league cup
4/12/23, 11:25 pm - Jono: Usually takes 1 or 2 games to settle back in
4/12/23, 11:25 pm - Jono: No concern here
4/12/23, 11:25 pm - James: Ditto
4/12/23, 11:26 pm - James: When was that
4/12/23, 11:26 pm - Jono: 2022
4/12/23, 11:26 pm - James: Deli alli got spurs to a CL final
4/12/23, 11:26 pm - James: 🤷
4/12/23, 11:27 pm - Jono: He’s good/decent. No Alisson but I wouldn’t expect him to be
4/12/23, 11:27 pm - Jono: If he was not up to it he’d be sent to Newty like Karius
4/12/23, 11:28 pm - James: So it's not like you signed 'two number ones'
4/12/23, 11:28 pm - Jono: You better hope Dubravka doesn’t get injured 🤕
4/12/23, 11:28 pm - James: One area we have plenty of cover
4/12/23, 11:28 pm - James: Hence three on the bench most games atm
4/12/23, 11:29 pm - James: Well we'd get behind him and not send him death threats if he gets a concussion and makes a mistake. You'll never walk alone heyyyyy
4/12/23, 11:31 pm - James: If it wasn't for Karius you wouldn't have got to a CL final
4/12/23, 11:31 pm - James: 😬
4/12/23, 11:32 pm - Jono: Nuh we had goals galore to cover the goals conceded that campaign. Except the final tho unforch
4/12/23, 11:32 pm - Jono: Salah, Mane and Bobby were scoring for fun
4/12/23, 11:34 pm - Pero: Newty will probably go for ramsdale in next window
4/12/23, 11:34 pm - Jono: Shearer has no shame lol
4/12/23, 11:34 pm - Pero: Koleosho is bloody decent 👌
4/12/23, 11:34 pm - James: Shearer knows ball
4/12/23, 11:35 pm - Jono: Might as well just rename it the "Newty and friends team of the week"
4/12/23, 11:35 pm - Jono: Funny how he's just though fuck it - Trent in the midfield
4/12/23, 11:35 pm - James: It's good to have a knowledgeable ex legend as a pundit
4/12/23, 11:36 pm - Gerrard: Karius
4/12/23, 11:36 pm - Jono: Shame he won fuck all at Newty. Deserved better like Stevie
4/12/23, 11:36 pm - James: Don't see anyone asking for spitty carragher's take...
4/12/23, 11:36 pm - James: He's in Saudi mate taking the blood money like Mane and Bobby and Robbie and Hendy
4/12/23, 11:37 pm - Jono: Carra's earning enough from Sky and CBS to not have to pick a team of the week for PL
4/12/23, 11:37 pm - James: Winning! 😂
4/12/23, 11:37 pm - Jono: He gets to hang out with that hot bitch too
4/12/23, 11:37 pm - Jono: From CBS coverage
4/12/23, 11:38 pm - Jono: They were in Miami the other day doing the CL coverage for some strange reason
4/12/23, 11:38 pm - James: I don't think anyone wants him after that admission to wrighty
4/12/23, 11:43 pm - James: https://x.com/talkSPORT/status/1731697111085830190?s=08
5/12/23, 12:07 am - Pero: Is that the mocca chik that Henry wants to fuck ?
5/12/23, 12:13 am - Dave: Oh Newty will be all over him like a rash. Upgrade on pope. Hope Arsenal set his price tag high
5/12/23, 12:14 am - James: Mid chick
5/12/23, 12:15 am - James: Hopefully he's stays at Varsenal. Deserve each other
5/12/23, 12:35 am - Gerrard: @14244893404
5/12/23, 3:25 am - Jono: Haha Bridges just makes up quotes to keep Optus content quota up
5/12/23, 3:34 am - Gerrard: Same bad tactics,
Vs Chelsea naive
Vs City brave
5/12/23, 3:48 am - Gerrard: Lol those aren't all starters
5/12/23, 3:50 am - James: 5-6 are and we can't make a sub lol
5/12/23, 3:52 am - James: @61409710717 I have a question about Ange since I never saw or heard of the bloke before. Does he always act bashful and butter wouldn't melt in his mouth in interviews or is this a new persona he's adopted
5/12/23, 3:53 am - Gerrard: I'll give you Pope and Botman, the rest are championship and you know it.
5/12/23, 3:54 am - James: The ones who finished 4th last season...
5/12/23, 3:54 am - Gerrard: United came 3rd last season...
5/12/23, 3:55 am - James: I asked you a question about Ange
5/12/23, 3:55 am - Gerrard: Just saw that as you trying to win me over
5/12/23, 3:55 am - James: I don't want you to fuck me mate we ain't related
5/12/23, 3:59 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 🤣
5/12/23, 3:59 am - James: @14244893404

5/12/23, 10:40 pm - James: What is happening
5/12/23, 10:40 pm - James: Luton scored 3 against the champions 😂
5/12/23, 10:40 pm - Pero: We need some subs
5/12/23, 10:41 pm - James: Rice is worth more than the whole Luton squad and their fans
5/12/23, 10:42 pm - James: Shock horror
5/12/23, 10:46 pm - Pero: Rice having another solid game
5/12/23, 10:52 pm - James: @14244893404 hope arteta doesn't over celebrate or fist pump whatever the result today
5/12/23, 10:53 pm - Dave: He won’t for a point…
5/12/23, 10:55 pm - Jono: Pen for sure here

5/12/23, 11:16 pm - Pero: There's the 105M
5/12/23, 11:17 pm - James: Embarrassing
5/12/23, 11:17 pm - Dave: What a fucking game
5/12/23, 11:17 pm - Dave: I’m pumped
5/12/23, 11:18 pm - Dave: “The sort of moment where titles are won”
5/12/23, 11:18 pm - Dave: Commentator said it, not me. Don’t shoot the messenger
5/12/23, 11:18 pm - Gerrard: Did the refs keep them playing until Arsenal scored?
5/12/23, 11:20 pm - Pero: Luton time wasting adjustments made at the end
5/12/23, 11:20 pm - Pero: But raya needs to be benched now
5/12/23, 11:20 pm - Gerrard: Convenient
5/12/23, 11:23 pm - James: Bad for business if Arsenal dropped points to luton
5/12/23, 11:26 pm - Gerrard: Feels just like that Bournemouth game last season <This message was edited>
5/12/23, 11:28 pm - James: Disss graaace
5/12/23, 11:31 pm - Dave: That’s rich
5/12/23, 11:32 pm - Gerrard: Refs pulling back advantage for City when they could've scored a winner, extra time added for Arsenal to get a winner.....
5/12/23, 11:33 pm - Dave: Pathetic
5/12/23, 11:34 pm - Gerrard: Think the Prem wants a top of the table clash in a few weeks between Livo and Arsenal, need to keep Arsenal in the top two before that.
5/12/23, 11:35 pm - Dave: Good shout. That’s exactly what the prem want, you’re right
5/12/23, 11:35 pm - Gerrard: Arteta got his way after his crying about refs it seems
5/12/23, 11:36 pm - Gerrard: Learnt from Fergie
5/12/23, 11:39 pm - Gerrard: Arteta may now be the 5th best manager in the league
5/12/23, 11:42 pm - Gerrard: Neck and neck with Ange
5/12/23, 11:44 pm - Dave: And Klopp ❤️
5/12/23, 11:44 pm - Dave: You won’t see the time wasting on the 3 minute highlights
5/12/23, 11:45 pm - Gerrard: You seem overly defensive about this....
5/12/23, 11:49 pm - Pero: Yeh the ref even lifted his wrist and pointed to his watch when Luton were time wasting during their throw in. Luton will be regretting that now
6/12/23, 12:03 am - Dave: Don’t care. Another 3 points, business as usual 👊💪
6/12/23, 12:03 am - James: If either Varsenal or Varpool win the league they'd be the worse champions in its history
6/12/23, 12:03 am - James: Letting in three vs Fulham and Luton lols
6/12/23, 12:04 am - James: Hopefully citeh get back in their groove to save the embarrassment
6/12/23, 12:05 am - Dave: God yeah, really hope so
6/12/23, 12:06 am - James: Good for the premier league
6/12/23, 12:09 am - Dave: https://x.com/optussport/status/1732169573326303543?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
6/12/23, 12:14 am - James: Luton
6/12/23, 12:15 am - Dave: Good side
6/12/23, 12:15 am - Dave: If you’re in the prem, you’re a good side
6/12/23, 12:15 am - James: Varpool pull this trick often
6/12/23, 12:15 am - Dave: As you found out against the mighty Bournemouth giving it barry big bollocks in the corner over here
6/12/23, 12:38 am - James: Not OK if klopp does it though?
6/12/23, 12:38 am - Dave: Who said that?
6/12/23, 1:15 am - Gerrard: Don't be like him Pero, you were always so unbiased in the past
6/12/23, 1:16 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 why does Jimmity talk so much?
I thought he said if your team is shite then you can't talk.
6/12/23, 1:18 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0fbuUjB273/?igshid=NGEwZGU0MjU5Mw==
He def learnt from Pep, slightly demented

6/12/23, 1:29 am - James: @14244893404 this lad is cooked if he thinks Newcastle are shite. Must be all the inbreeding 🤣 <This message was edited>
6/12/23, 2:42 am - Pero: Just commenting on what i saw. Facts only
6/12/23, 3:27 am - Dave: They’re not shite, unfair comment Gez. They’re above average and have a great team spirit and togetherness about them 👊
6/12/23, 3:28 am - James: Jezzy is in denial
6/12/23, 3:30 am - Gerrard: I just don't see them anywhere near Arsenal or Liverpool 🤷🏼‍♂️
6/12/23, 3:34 am - Dave: Fair comment. They’re still punching imo
6/12/23, 3:36 am - James: De nial
6/12/23, 3:36 am - Gerrard: And if the refs didn't screw Arsenal and Liverpool, while favouring Newty, it would be an even further distance away.
6/12/23, 3:36 am - Gerrard: 🤷🏼‍♂️
6/12/23, 3:38 am - James: With how amazing your clubs supposedly are and because we're shite allegedly with loads of injuries why you not further away from us in the table?
6/12/23, 3:46 am - Jono: Newty will be top 5 with us, City, Arsenal and Spurs
6/12/23, 3:46 am - Jono: The rest just not good enough to compete. Villa a smokie
6/12/23, 3:48 am - Jono: I think a lot of these players are still burnt out hard from last season especially the ones who played in the WC
6/12/23, 3:49 am - Jono: Perhaps the counter to that is they’d be fucked anyway if the WC was in the euro summer
6/12/23, 3:49 am - Jono: But the season did end later from memory
6/12/23, 3:59 am - James: They'll win the conference league
6/12/23, 3:59 am - James: At least there is a two week break at Christmas
6/12/23, 4:00 am - James: You think spurs because they only play one game a week from now pretty much?
6/12/23, 4:00 am - James: Chelsea could get their shit together
6/12/23, 4:00 am - Jono: There isn’t though right? I thought the break was around the time the African cup and Asian cup is on
6/12/23, 4:01 am - Jono: Spurs play with purpose like Newty
6/12/23, 4:01 am - James: No idea. Didn't realise that was happening
6/12/23, 4:01 am - Jono: That’s enough to get you top 5 this season
6/12/23, 4:01 am - Jono: With Mancs and Chelsea looking lost
6/12/23, 4:01 am - James: Mancs are done deffo
6/12/23, 4:02 am - James: Brighton may end up doing well in europa
6/12/23, 4:02 am - James: I think there is a gap after the Christmas eve games
6/12/23, 4:02 am - James: FA Cup sandwiched in somewhere though
6/12/23, 4:03 am - Jono: https://www.premierleague.com/news/3616087
6/12/23, 4:03 am - Jono: This is the only gap
6/12/23, 4:03 am - Jono: The Xmas schedule is still wild like it usually is
6/12/23, 4:04 am - Jono: Split round over 2 weeks basically
6/12/23, 4:44 am - James: More injuries and burn out for the euros
6/12/23, 4:44 am - James: While every other nation has a break
6/12/23, 4:45 am - James: The FA should stop the premier league but they won't $$$
6/12/23, 4:50 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 nerds
6/12/23, 4:52 am - James: You ran out of relatives pants to sniff?

6/12/23, 5:11 am - James: Jez?
6/12/23, 5:12 am - Jono: We’ve all been too horny from time to time
6/12/23, 5:12 am - James: Can't call myself an aussie yet then <This message was edited>

6/12/23, 5:15 am - James: Every season same thing
6/12/23, 5:15 am - James: Can't they just accept what they are now
6/12/23, 5:15 am - James: It's been ten years
6/12/23, 5:19 am - Gerrard: I'll message on the side why we're laughing at Jimmity
6/12/23, 5:22 am - James: Explaining the incest?
6/12/23, 5:22 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 🤣
6/12/23, 5:23 am - James: He said it not me!?
6/12/23, 5:53 am - Dave: Agree. Newty comfortable top 5 now theyre dumped out of champions league
6/12/23, 6:07 am - James: What's going on with jez fucking members of his own family @14244893404
6/12/23, 6:36 am - Gerrard: #TriggerWeek
6/12/23, 6:36 am - Gerrard: All these slights are getting missed 🤣

6/12/23, 8:56 pm - James: Has klipp lost his hair or going bald?
6/12/23, 8:56 pm - James: Can't remember the last time I saw him without a cap
6/12/23, 9:10 pm - Jono: Cheeky assist from TAA
6/12/23, 9:31 pm - Jono: Goal rush choosing a mid table scrap as their main game
6/12/23, 9:31 pm - Jono: And already a missed penalty
6/12/23, 9:31 pm - James: Haaland missed a sitter and Manure missed a pen
6/12/23, 9:45 pm - Pero: Bruno F missed the pen . Chelsea look very bad
6/12/23, 9:53 pm - Pero: Commentary summarised it well "chelsea chaotic at the moment" 😅
6/12/23, 9:54 pm - Louie: The disrespect of Antony nutmegging his Brazil captain. It’s like me trying to nutmeg Gerry.

6/12/23, 10:43 pm - Pero: Citeh are in panic mode, even haaland is behind the ball playing low block . Pep to pop after the game

6/12/23, 11:12 pm - Gerrard: One of us
6/12/23, 11:15 pm - Gerrard: United above Newty
6/12/23, 11:16 pm - Gerrard: @61413646755 Newty could use McTominay
6/12/23, 11:24 pm - Dave: Mctominay would walk into Newty <This message was edited>
6/12/23, 11:28 pm - Dave: This city downfall is fantastic
6/12/23, 11:28 pm - Liam: Amazing
6/12/23, 11:28 pm - Dave: Best thing is as well, is that Villa smashed them lol
6/12/23, 11:28 pm - Dave: Literally peppered them <This message was edited>
6/12/23, 11:28 pm - Liam: City could do with him
6/12/23, 11:29 pm - Gerrard: They've forgotten that defending is a pretty big aspect of playing football
6/12/23, 11:35 pm - Gerrard: Imagine Arsenal stuck with Emery
7/12/23, 12:10 am - James: They're only six points behind you after 15 games lol
7/12/23, 12:11 am - James: And you are Arsenal remember
7/12/23, 12:11 am - James: Bottle FC
7/12/23, 12:11 am - Gerrard: Mr Negative Nelly has entered the chat.
7/12/23, 12:11 am - James: Had they kept Emery they might have been champions by now
7/12/23, 12:12 am - James: Instead of celebrating getting into the top four after five years
7/12/23, 12:19 am - James: Varpool only managed a 2-0 win against the worst team in the league...
7/12/23, 12:19 am - James: Should be putting 8 past them at least
7/12/23, 12:20 am - Gerrard: Day 4 of trigger week
7/12/23, 12:23 am - Jono: City going to club World Cup too
7/12/23, 12:23 am - Jono: They’re in T- Rouble
7/12/23, 12:32 am - Jono: BREAKING: Joel Matip has ruptured his ACL, Jurgen Klopp has confirmed. Terrible news. Devastating. In his final year of his deal he may not play for the club again.
7/12/23, 12:32 am - Jono: Sighhhh
7/12/23, 12:33 am - Dave: Oh here we go. Sorry for celebrating mate, let me just get back in my box
7/12/23, 12:34 am - Dave: You flew 10,000 miles to watch your team bottle it lad
7/12/23, 12:36 am - Dave: https://x.com/trollfootball/status/1732523338285629719?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
7/12/23, 12:44 am - Jono: Arsenal have every reason to get excited now
7/12/23, 12:44 am - Jono: City with club world cup to factor in
7/12/23, 12:45 am - Jono: They'll be a few games more behind that will be played next year when Arsenal likely won't have to play
7/12/23, 12:46 am - Jono: I'm not getting excited over LFC as i think we're a few January transfers off competing for the title now with some key long term injuries.
7/12/23, 12:46 am - Jono: It's for Arsenal to lose now
7/12/23, 12:53 am - Jono: 22 shots to 2!!!
7/12/23, 1:11 am - James: At least I watch my team play bud
7/12/23, 1:14 am - James: It would be their honour
7/12/23, 1:15 am - Dave: Saw my team play more recently than you 💅
7/12/23, 1:16 am - James: A friendly in soccer ball land ⚽😂
7/12/23, 1:56 am - Jono: Villa v Arsenal on the weekend
7/12/23, 1:57 am - Jono: That'll be a biggen
7/12/23, 2:20 am - Louie: More importantly 3 points off the top 4. Imagine if we actually start playing well. We’ll win the league
7/12/23, 2:30 am - Dave: Huge game
7/12/23, 2:30 am - James: A dickin
7/12/23, 2:31 am - James: Bizzare varsenal fans don't rate that cup considering their lack of success recently. It's the cup nobody rates once they've been knocked out
7/12/23, 2:45 am - Dave: I’ve never seen a top team go for it. It’s a nuisance tournament that bottom half clubs go for in a desperate hope of winning something
7/12/23, 2:55 am - Gerrard: And lose they will 👍🏻
7/12/23, 2:56 am - James: Except all the recent past winners like Varpool and Citeh
7/12/23, 2:57 am - James: Even ten hag has won a legitimate trophy unlike arteta
7/12/23, 4:19 am - Dave: https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-city-guardiola-carabao-cup-31015856.amp

7/12/23, 5:19 am - James: Villa v Varpool?
7/12/23, 5:23 am - Jono: We beat em 3-0 already
7/12/23, 5:24 am - Jono: And yes I know you beat em 5-1
7/12/23, 5:26 am - James: https://x.com/talkSPORT/status/1732547760837042567?s=08
7/12/23, 5:27 am - James: Emery vs Arteta
7/12/23, 5:27 am - James: Real manager vs Lego manager
7/12/23, 5:41 am - Dave: Almighty confident for a team that couldn’t get Bournemouth last week and lost to Nottingham last month
7/12/23, 5:41 am - James: Villa a beast at home
7/12/23, 5:43 am - James: Varsenal shaky away
7/12/23, 5:43 am - Dave: Last time we went Villa park we put 4 past them
7/12/23, 5:43 am - James: Should be happy with a point
7/12/23, 5:44 am - Dave: I would be happy with a point. Can’t win them all and they’re on fire at the moment
7/12/23, 5:44 am - James: That's why you won't win the league
7/12/23, 5:44 am - Dave: They’re not going to batter us though
7/12/23, 5:44 am - James: Attitudes like that
7/12/23, 5:44 am - James: Watkins, Bailey and Diaby will get lots of space
7/12/23, 5:44 am - Dave: Newty aren’t getting top 4 Jimmety. Back in your box
7/12/23, 5:45 am - James: What's Newcastle got to do with this chat
7/12/23, 5:45 am - James: Fuck me
7/12/23, 5:45 am - Dave: Statistically we allow teams the least space in the league
7/12/23, 5:45 am - James: 🫨
7/12/23, 5:50 am - James: Chelsea 😂
7/12/23, 8:23 pm - Dave: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0g7O6atyMj/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
7/12/23, 8:49 pm - Liam: Trust the process
7/12/23, 8:50 pm - Dave: Everton got Newty in the pressure cooker
7/12/23, 8:50 pm - Dave: Goal coming
7/12/23, 9:10 pm - Dave: Maybe not. Calvert Lewin is fucking shite
7/12/23, 9:10 pm - Dave: May as well been an open goal
7/12/23, 9:11 pm - Liam: Shocking
7/12/23, 9:23 pm - James: Rank game
7/12/23, 9:23 pm - James: Dyche ball
7/12/23, 9:34 pm - Dave: Howe should learn from him. They’re peppering your goal. Like a shooting range
7/12/23, 9:40 pm - Jono: I just wanna see Everton go down and play in their shiny new stadium against Blackpool
7/12/23, 9:43 pm - James: Just give them the three points
7/12/23, 9:47 pm - James: That won't happen unfortunately
7/12/23, 9:47 pm - James: Couldn't of picked a better season to get a deduction
7/12/23, 9:58 pm - Dave: Who do you reckon are going down?
7/12/23, 10:12 pm - James: Not Everton lol
7/12/23, 10:13 pm - Dave: Decent goal. Feel like Dubravka could have possibly done better
7/12/23, 10:14 pm - Dave: Yeah they’re not going down, been all over you 😂
7/12/23, 10:14 pm - Dave: Sheffield and burnley sure things imo
7/12/23, 10:15 pm - Dave: Feel like Luton will cling on
7/12/23, 10:16 pm - James: What did they expect. It's dyche. Pepper the box with crosses and shots
7/12/23, 10:17 pm - James: Gordon been jank too
7/12/23, 10:18 pm - James: Fucking hell trippier
7/12/23, 10:28 pm - Dave: Hahahahaha
7/12/23, 10:28 pm - Dave: Fuck me, you cannot say a word about us until the new year now @61452662705. What a drumming
7/12/23, 10:29 pm - Pero: PickFord taking the piss and then 20 ole's with a goal
7/12/23, 10:29 pm - Pero: Whats happened to Newtle
7/12/23, 10:30 pm - Jono: Even Beto scored
7/12/23, 10:31 pm - Jono: He’s fucking terrible
7/12/23, 10:31 pm - James: Tripper playing him onside
7/12/23, 10:31 pm - Dave: One season wonders for top 4
7/12/23, 10:31 pm - James: This is all in trippier
7/12/23, 10:31 pm - James: *on
7/12/23, 10:32 pm - James: All the goals
7/12/23, 10:32 pm - Jono: At least Jimmy’s got the Who You Beat? Argument still going strong
7/12/23, 10:32 pm - Dave: So glad I finally broke the bank and put him in my fantasy team this week
7/12/23, 10:32 pm - James: That is true
7/12/23, 10:33 pm - James: West Ham hold on it's not the end of the world
7/12/23, 10:33 pm - James: But no way are we beating spurs on sun
7/12/23, 10:34 pm - James: Credit to dyche finally got some fire into Everton
7/12/23, 10:34 pm - James: Good to see Lascelles pull up with a hammy now too
7/12/23, 10:34 pm - James: Brilliant
7/12/23, 10:35 pm - Dave: Nope. You know I’d actually go as far as saying you wouldn’t have lost that game with Pope. You were missing him big time
7/12/23, 10:35 pm - Dave: Think Pope would have saved first and third goal
7/12/23, 10:35 pm - James: We're fucked till after Christmas
7/12/23, 10:36 pm - James: Away from home terrible
7/12/23, 10:36 pm - Pero: Whats with the 250 security guards around the pitch ?
7/12/23, 10:36 pm - James: Someone probably wants to lay Gordon out
7/12/23, 10:37 pm - James: We always were going to. But trippier was shite and our front three were wank. Got what we deserved
7/12/23, 10:37 pm - Dave: Proper dicking
7/12/23, 10:38 pm - Liam: 3-0 lol
7/12/23, 10:38 pm - Liam: Wow
7/12/23, 10:39 pm - Liam: What happen?
7/12/23, 10:59 pm - James: Deserved dicking
7/12/23, 11:03 pm - James: West Ham winning at spurs
7/12/23, 11:03 pm - James: Great match week for Varsenal, Varpool and Villa
7/12/23, 11:04 pm - Jono: Very good. Need some space to accommodate for some dropped points in the coming weeks
7/12/23, 11:04 pm - Jono: Arsenal, over to you
7/12/23, 11:05 pm - Jono: Honestly. They could open up a sizeable gap if they don’t crumble….. low on injuries, decent form… don’t fuck it up
7/12/23, 11:08 pm - James: Deffo you two top too if you can open up a gap because citeh will come on strong as usual
7/12/23, 11:09 pm - James: 4-5th open for three teama
7/12/23, 11:09 pm - James: Teams
7/12/23, 11:12 pm - Chris: Spurs with another loss. I  wonder how long ange will last
7/12/23, 11:15 pm - James: They'll beat us on sun
7/12/23, 11:15 pm - James: But 4 losses and a draw last five for him
8/12/23, 12:07 am - Gerrard: Just got reception.

8/12/23, 12:48 am - Jono: Newtle really find it tough against teams in the relegation zone
8/12/23, 1:22 am - James: Away from home awful this season
8/12/23, 1:22 am - James: Except sheff manure and psg
8/12/23, 1:23 am - James: Really makes varpools win against us meaningless if we're that bad. And what it makes of Varsenals defeat...
8/12/23, 1:25 am - Liam: Just watched the highlights…. Trippier on a mad one
8/12/23, 1:25 am - Dave: What have Arsenal got to do with your spectacular decline
8/12/23, 1:26 am - James: All three I think
8/12/23, 1:26 am - James: Spectacular decline is one defeat?
8/12/23, 1:26 am - Dave: One season wonders. When I say wonder, is fourth a wonder?
8/12/23, 1:26 am - James: Still top of form guide mate
8/12/23, 1:26 am - James: Or second now probs
8/12/23, 1:26 am - Dave: This that imaginary table that no one gives a shit about
8/12/23, 1:26 am - James: Took you long enough to get back in it
8/12/23, 1:27 am - James: Took sir eddie one season mate
8/12/23, 1:27 am - James: From relegation to top four
8/12/23, 1:27 am - Dave: Most consistent top 4 team in premier league history
8/12/23, 1:27 am - James: Took cryetea three years 8th to CL lol
8/12/23, 1:27 am - James: How many CLs that got you?
8/12/23, 1:28 am - James: Like the top at Christmas table?
8/12/23, 1:28 am - Dave: What’s that got to do with the price of apples
8/12/23, 1:28 am - Dave: Same response to this as above
8/12/23, 1:28 am - James: Varsenal fan givin it the biggin
8/12/23, 1:29 am - James: Did our defeat today get you the three pts at St James
8/12/23, 1:29 am - James: ?
8/12/23, 1:29 am - James: You're our bitch
8/12/23, 1:36 am - Dave: Have fun lifting that trophy at the end of the season. The “we beat Arsenal 1-0 by an illegitimate VAR blunder goal” trophy 🏆
8/12/23, 1:41 am - James: And you have the we beat Luton in the 96th minute trophy
8/12/23, 1:42 am - James: Varpool have the we beat Newcastle at St James' trophy
8/12/23, 1:42 am - James: We're all happy

8/12/23, 2:40 am - James: https://youtube.com/shorts/PuzrnwnuftY?feature=shared
8/12/23, 2:41 am - James: I blame Klopp. Says this and then we lose like that
8/12/23, 3:19 am - Liam: Newy a one hit wonder?
8/12/23, 3:48 am - Gerrard: HI @61452662705 just about to enter Meredith
8/12/23, 3:48 am - Gerrard: 👋🏻
8/12/23, 7:07 am - James: Pics @61409710717?
8/12/23, 8:31 am - Dave: One fourth wonder innit
8/12/23, 11:22 am - Jono: https://x.com/holy_binnerty/status/1732897899766288622?s=48
8/12/23, 11:22 am - Jono: About the only time I’ve ever been on Pickford’s side 😅
8/12/23, 12:40 pm - James: Don't get in the habit of liking your neighbours 😂
8/12/23, 12:42 pm - Jono: I just love seeing butthurt Brazilians
8/12/23, 12:42 pm - Jono: It overrides Everton hate
8/12/23, 12:43 pm - Jono: Joelinton and Bruno G were cookin but seemed easily retreated by their own teammates
8/12/23, 12:44 pm - James: Tbf to small arms, we've battered that lad for years
8/12/23, 12:44 pm - James: Finally got one on us
8/12/23, 12:45 pm - James: What actually happened. I obviously turned off toward the end
8/12/23, 12:48 pm - Jono: He gave some to the away fans
8/12/23, 12:48 pm - Jono: So then about 10 Newcastle players went after him
8/12/23, 12:50 pm - James: Fair
8/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gerrard: Reception bad
8/12/23, 4:29 pm - Gerrard: Love you all
8/12/23, 4:59 pm - Shaun: <Media omitted>

8/12/23, 6:08 pm - Dave: Getting group chat withdrawals? 😂
8/12/23, 10:56 pm - Jono: Welfare check
8/12/23, 10:56 pm - Jono: @61409710717
9/12/23, 12:19 am - Dave: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0iz6o0tt1G/
9/12/23, 1:29 am - Pero: Kloppy so sensitive
9/12/23, 11:57 am - Gerrard: It's wet
9/12/23, 5:43 pm - Dave: This could be the chopping block day for ten hag, getting absolutely dicked at old Trafford by the cherries
9/12/23, 5:54 pm - James: Bournemouth are a good side
9/12/23, 6:05 pm - Dave: Of course you’d say that. You are your mates trips didn’t seem too happy about losing to them the other week
9/12/23, 6:15 pm - James: Good team
9/12/23, 6:15 pm - James: On fire atm
9/12/23, 6:44 pm - Jono: At least Ten Hag can leave with his head held high
9/12/23, 6:44 pm - Jono: As Novembers Manager of the Month
9/12/23, 6:44 pm - Jono: 🤣🤣🤣

9/12/23, 7:04 pm - James: I thought I was up early
9/12/23, 7:04 pm - James: Watching arsenal lose
9/12/23, 8:32 pm - Jono: Great morning of results
9/12/23, 8:32 pm - Jono: 🔝
9/12/23, 9:46 pm - Dave: For you maybe 😂
9/12/23, 9:46 pm - Dave: We were totally robbed as usual
9/12/23, 9:46 pm - Dave: VAR is a joke, should be scrapped
9/12/23, 9:46 pm - Jono: How?
9/12/23, 9:47 pm - Jono: I watched the whole game. You missed decent chances
9/12/23, 9:47 pm - Dave: Cash handball, should have been a pen
9/12/23, 9:47 pm - Dave: We deserved a point from that game
9/12/23, 9:47 pm - Dave: Did miss some decent chances admittedly. We’re missing a proven 9. Need to sign one in Jan
9/12/23, 9:48 pm - Dave: https://x.com/rory_talks_ball/status/1733569209760657849?s=46&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
9/12/23, 9:48 pm - Dave: Havertz goal should have been ruled out but if that’s enough to give a handball and rule the goal out, the two handballs by Cash first should have awarded us a penalty
9/12/23, 9:49 pm - Dave: Classic VAR blunder
9/12/23, 9:49 pm - Jono: They show more scrutiny to the attacker
9/12/23, 9:49 pm - Jono: Based on the rule
9/12/23, 9:50 pm - Jono: Hence they let the cash handball go because of all the ricochets between both players
9/12/23, 9:51 pm - Dave: Oh come on mate
9/12/23, 9:51 pm - Dave: What part of that hitting Havertz hand led to the goal
9/12/23, 9:51 pm - Dave: You know that was weak as piss
9/12/23, 9:51 pm - Jono: The bit where the ball travels from his arm to the ball perhaps haha
9/12/23, 9:53 pm - Jono: I’m all for VAR bashing but I think you should be blaming your missed chances more than that moment
9/12/23, 9:53 pm - Jono: There were plenty
9/12/23, 9:54 pm - Dave: It hit cash’s chest, Havertz leg and then he kicked in the back of the net. Regardless, I think the goal should have been disallowed. But we should have had a penalty if you’re disallowing that based on a handball
9/12/23, 9:54 pm - Dave: As it hit cash’s arm first and then his hand.
9/12/23, 9:55 pm - Dave: Oh I am. I’ve been saying we need a solid 9 ever since Auba left, I think it’s the missing piece of the puzzle
9/12/23, 9:56 pm - Jono: I don’t make the rules man
9/12/23, 9:56 pm - Dave: Totally agree, today was more about missed chances. Odegaard isn’t quite ticking still is he, he missed two sitters
9/12/23, 9:56 pm - Jono: The heavier rules for handball are more on the attacker these days
9/12/23, 9:57 pm - Jono: And in Cash’s case he was close enough to Havertz for VAR to warrant it was proximity to the previous ball contact from Havertz that saves him
9/12/23, 9:57 pm - Dave: We need to spend in Jan. Offload Eddie
9/12/23, 9:57 pm - Jono: Was explained on the coverage after wards
9/12/23, 9:58 pm - Jono: Which I thought the same watching live
9/12/23, 9:58 pm - Jono: If you’re the ref on field it’s impossible to give given how fast it all happened and the bodies all around the ball
9/12/23, 9:59 pm - Dave: Think that’s bullshit. But I don’t write the rules
9/12/23, 9:59 pm - Dave: Wish I did lol
9/12/23, 10:00 pm - Jono: Though the ball down from Havertz arm to his foot is deemed a handball irrespective of whether it’s an accident or not.
Same as Bournemouths 4th goal today
9/12/23, 10:01 pm - Dave: Handball is a handball imo. Cash hand ball first, arsenal pen. Overcomplicated
9/12/23, 10:02 pm - Dave: Congrats Liverpool fans being top today. Going to have to try and beat that what? 10 year curse at Anfield? 🤮😂
9/12/23, 10:05 pm - Jono: If we play the way we’ve played the last few weeks, you’ll beat us
9/12/23, 10:06 pm - Jono: Haha United could very easily lose their next 3
9/12/23, 10:12 pm - Louie: We’ll bounce back, starting off with a win against Bayern 😩
9/12/23, 10:13 pm - Jono: https://x.com/betfair/status/1733531781771522513?s=48
9/12/23, 10:13 pm - Dave: You ten hag out yet Louis?
9/12/23, 10:13 pm - Dave: Surprised he’s still in a job tbh
9/12/23, 10:13 pm - Dave: He seems in denial about what’s happening at the club
9/12/23, 10:13 pm - Pero: Var inconsistency once again bloody joke I cant keep up with it anymore
9/12/23, 10:14 pm - Dave: Anfield is a fortress. Very difficult place to come away with a result
9/12/23, 10:15 pm - Louie: Not yet, but it was painful watching the game this morning.
9/12/23, 10:16 pm - Dave: Do you think it’s ten hag or the club?
9/12/23, 10:16 pm - Pero: Would be curious to see the stat showing how many games allison has saved livo . The guy is an animal worlds best keeper atm
9/12/23, 10:17 pm - Jono: I still think we’ve been very lucky recently even at home. Fulham aside from worldie goals we were very erratic
9/12/23, 10:18 pm - Louie: 100% the club/players. The players down tools in the second season of a managers tenure.
9/12/23, 10:19 pm - Dave: Going to be interesting to see top 4 come end of the season. So tight this season, exciting
9/12/23, 10:21 pm - Dave: Maybe the glazers will sell up if you stop getting top 4. Got to shell out a load of cash on the stadium as well right?
9/12/23, 10:21 pm - Dave: Could be the best thing for you, get the club sold and rebuild from top down
9/12/23, 10:23 pm - Pero: True all teams are showing weakness is some area or another , week in week out will be unpredictable now
9/12/23, 10:24 pm - Jono: Bayern will be a little fired up you’d think
9/12/23, 10:24 pm - Pero: Villa didn't look strong after they went defensive at 1-0 we should of buried a few
9/12/23, 10:26 pm - Dave: We were unlucky. Odegaard would have buried a couple on his own today if he was firing. Saka offside for one. These games happen
9/12/23, 10:27 pm - Dave: Stats were all on our side. Just not the scoreline. Wild that Villa dominated city so heavily during the week, bizarre watching them struggle
9/12/23, 10:29 pm - Louie: I can only hope that’s what the players are trying to do. But people still support the club, sell out the stadium and buy jerseys. So Glazers are getting what they want, the results don’t matter.
9/12/23, 10:30 pm - Louie: Or the start of a bad run of form 🤞
9/12/23, 10:30 pm - Louie: @61409710717 I’m sending messages even though United lost
9/12/23, 10:36 pm - Dave: Feel like Arsenal was somewhat similar until they stopped getting that top 4 money. Motto was business first and club second. Then I think Kroenke bought out the Russians and his lad got more involved and took the reign’s. Best thing that could have happened to us
10/12/23, 12:05 am - Gerrard: And it's being noted.
10/12/23, 12:11 am - Gerrard: What a wonderful weekend
10/12/23, 12:28 am - Louie: Hope we see some changes soon. United fans have suffered enough, we have had anything to brag about in a while.
10/12/23, 12:46 am - Jono: They tried after the League Cup win 😅
10/12/23, 5:12 am - Liam: Villa played a great game. Fair play, title contenders
10/12/23, 5:13 am - Liam: I think they will be in the top 4 for sure!

10/12/23, 2:21 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 best RB in the league?
10/12/23, 2:27 pm - Gerrard: Ange can suck a big fat dick
10/12/23, 2:32 pm - Gerrard: @61413646755 I hope ETH doesn't get sack before our next match
10/12/23, 2:32 pm - Gerrard: @61413646755 8-0 this time?
10/12/23, 2:36 pm - Gerrard: @61422023136 @14244893404 @61478754484 Odorguard doesn't have a right foot at all???
10/12/23, 2:38 pm - Gerrard: @61422023136 @14244893404 @61452662705 Arteta role modelling in full affect, going desperate long ball at the end and Havertz upset because he's not winning tries to injury Martinez
10/12/23, 4:54 pm - Dave: Walker
10/12/23, 4:54 pm - Dave: Rough day at the office
10/12/23, 4:55 pm - Dave: Get trying to find a winner until the bitter, pure grit and determination 👊
10/12/23, 4:55 pm - Dave: Will come back stronger
10/12/23, 4:57 pm - Dave: <Media omitted>
10/12/23, 5:47 pm - Dave: Schar injured as well now @61452662705 😢
10/12/23, 6:55 pm - Jono: RUOK @61452662705
10/12/23, 7:18 pm - Jono: At least Callum’s back lol
10/12/23, 7:22 pm - Liam: Newy getting battered?
10/12/23, 7:22 pm - Dave: Just wow, Newty really were one season wonders. Tripps banned for Fulham next week as well
10/12/23, 7:22 pm - Dave: Understatement
10/12/23, 7:23 pm - Liam: Season finished 🤷🏻
10/12/23, 7:23 pm - Liam: Still hope to get out the CL group??
10/12/23, 7:23 pm - Dave: Will be a miracle if they get top half at this rate to be honest
10/12/23, 7:23 pm - Dave: Not even trolling
10/12/23, 7:24 pm - Jono: They’re just getting ready for UCL this week
10/12/23, 7:24 pm - Dave: Fulham will smash them again next week, they’re on fire at the moment
10/12/23, 7:25 pm - Dave: Newcastle players trying to fight everyone at the end as usual. They’re such cunts
10/12/23, 7:25 pm - Liam: Would be a very successful season for newy, based on their history
10/12/23, 7:53 pm - Liam: https://x.com/thfcm14/status/1733896579797365079?s=48&t=2H6WZBte1Bbl316U4Om7qA
10/12/23, 8:25 pm - James: Have they released a statement?
10/12/23, 8:26 pm - James: Arteta and the fans blaming var everyime they're not good enough to win as usual 😢 <This message was edited>
10/12/23, 8:49 pm - Liam: Brave

10/12/23, 9:00 pm - Jono: He’s copping it for this hey
10/12/23, 9:00 pm - Jono: I kind of see what he means
10/12/23, 9:01 pm - Jono: Not that it means I don’t think he’s still a cunt

10/12/23, 9:41 pm - Jono: He’s had a great week
10/12/23, 9:49 pm - James: Guys cooked needs a week off
10/12/23, 9:49 pm - James: Got himself suspended for the Fulham game as did Lascelles
10/12/23, 10:03 pm - Dave: Fulham going to cook you 😬

11/12/23, 10:15 am - Gerrard: Lads, the PL has gone nuts in the last week.
You see Fulham v West Ham game?
Chelsea v Everton had me cheering on Everton.
Even Luton almost got a result against City.
11/12/23, 10:17 am - Pero: It's so competitive now you don't know what's going to happen each week
11/12/23, 10:18 am - Pero: Even Sheffield are finally showing some positive moments although they are still shite
11/12/23, 10:18 am - Pero: Just like chelsea
11/12/23, 10:20 am - Jono: It’s good fun. We should look at the schedule and meet up a couple of times to watch games after the new year. Got a feeling it could go down to the last few games

11/12/23, 10:21 pm - James: He has a point
11/12/23, 10:21 pm - James: That vid is a bit dramatic though
11/12/23, 11:43 pm - Gerrard: I guess time will tell on this one
11/12/23, 11:54 pm - James: Get worse?
11/12/23, 11:55 pm - Gerrard: You talking about Newty's season again
12/12/23, 1:32 am - Dave: @61452662705 thoughts? https://www.teamtalk.com/newcastle-united/newcastle-sign-man-city-kalvin-phillips-juventus
12/12/23, 1:40 am - Gerrard: Got worse
12/12/23, 1:42 am - James: He'd need ten games to get up to speed and wouldn't even start in a fully fit midfield
12/12/23, 1:42 am - Jono: How far did he get Leeds up to? Mid table?
12/12/23, 1:45 am - James: Pep only signed him because Varpool wanted him
12/12/23, 1:48 am - Dave: Less of a liability than those horrible cunts Bruno and Joelinton to be fair. Not sure how they’re not on reds every time they play
12/12/23, 1:49 am - James: Gabriel is big Joe's bitch
12/12/23, 1:49 am - Jono: I feel like we dodge some bullets hey
12/12/23, 1:49 am - Jono: Phillips, Caicedo, Lavia
12/12/23, 1:50 am - Dave: Kalvin was actually decent when he was getting game time, had a really good tournament for England in… was it 2018?
12/12/23, 1:50 am - Jono: I’m pretty content with Endo and Macca if it’s got us at the top 16 games in
12/12/23, 1:51 am - Jono: Endo may look a little off the pace at times but I still think he’s decent
12/12/23, 1:52 am - James: That's a fucking atomic bomb
12/12/23, 1:52 am - Jono: What a legend. I feel sometimes we just brought him in so Salah could still feel like ‘the one’ up top for us rather than have competition
12/12/23, 1:53 am - James: 16 games doesn't mean much though 😂
12/12/23, 1:54 am - Jono: Rocks and diamonds. Klopp will eventually send him on his way though I’m sure he’d take a pay day in Saudi
12/12/23, 1:54 am - James: Cacido and Lavia have hardly played due to injury as well and are both young
12/12/23, 1:54 am - James: Yeah loads of clubs wanted him hence why pep got him in
12/12/23, 1:56 am - Dave: If anyone will get the best out of him it’ll be Eddie
12/12/23, 1:59 am - Dave: Solid addition to This Is England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
12/12/23, 2:38 am - Gerrard: Take it easy Havertz
12/12/23, 2:40 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/Qh7NgPedgJk?si=tkmeq31NQ9oUsHEI
Update
12/12/23, 3:36 am - Gerrard: Nunez was a better signing than Havertz
12/12/23, 5:04 am - Dave: Respectfully disagree. Would have agreed up until the last 4-5 weeks but Havertz has really come out his shell now. Really important player.

Havertz is only on one less goal this season than the 100m, Halaand alternative, goal machine Nunez
12/12/23, 5:06 am - James: Love this. He's awesome because we think he's done well for four games so he's great now
12/12/23, 5:06 am - James: He'll be the first lynched by the toxic fan base when Varsenals form dips over Christmas and new year
12/12/23, 5:07 am - James: Him and poor Eddie, even though he won't be on the pitch
12/12/23, 5:07 am - Dave: Like all your fan base screaming Almiron out all over Twitter
12/12/23, 5:07 am - Dave: True Geordie leading the charge with the Newcastle hate
12/12/23, 5:08 am - Dave: Because you’ve turned into a bunch of entitled fucks after coming fourth
12/12/23, 5:08 am - Gerrard: Lashing out instead of staying on topic....
12/12/23, 5:08 am - Dave: Bye bye Eddie. 🙏👋🏼
12/12/23, 5:08 am - James: What's this got to do with Almiron
12/12/23, 5:09 am - James: Havertz been shit ever since he left Germany
12/12/23, 5:09 am - Dave: Toxic
12/12/23, 5:09 am - Dave: Racist
12/12/23, 5:09 am - James: Doesn't even perform for the national team
12/12/23, 5:09 am - Dave: Been having worldies recently
12/12/23, 5:09 am - Dave: King Kai ❤️
12/12/23, 5:11 am - James: @61409710717 is Havertz a gun now? I don't watch Varsenal games except when they're getting their pants pulled down at SJP
12/12/23, 5:32 am - Liam: Havertz is PL of the month…. Change my mind
12/12/23, 5:46 am - James: On 12th December?
12/12/23, 5:46 am - James: You lost your last game?
12/12/23, 6:50 am - Dave: November POTM innit
12/12/23, 6:50 am - Dave: Great game. Two great teams battling it out, shame we had a bad day at the office and it didn’t go our way
12/12/23, 8:55 am - Gerrard: Wasn't it Harry?
12/12/23, 9:47 am - James: 'great teams' 🤥
12/12/23, 11:20 am - James: https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/9-reasons-why-everyone-hates-liverpool
12/12/23, 11:21 am - James: A little old but some great points
12/12/23, 11:35 am - Jono: Surprised Mancs haven’t found a random stat to make them seem better than they actually are this week
12/12/23, 11:36 am - Jono: Man U xG is higher in the first 15 minutes than any other team in the league… or some shit <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 11:36 am - Gerrard: What is gonna happen to the Mancs?
Kinda feel like they won't sack ETH
12/12/23, 11:37 am - Jono: They won’t sack him
12/12/23, 11:44 am - Gerrard: Then what
12/12/23, 11:44 am - Gerrard: Sack all the players
12/12/23, 11:47 am - Jono: Glazers won’t wanna spend any more
12/12/23, 11:47 am - Jono: So sacking ten hag isn’t an option
12/12/23, 11:47 am - Jono: They’ll just fail hard this season
12/12/23, 11:48 am - Jono: And assume a clean out of sorts once the new owner comes in. But this season will set them back a few more years now surely
12/12/23, 11:48 am - Jono: Also, I got excited about Girona in La Liga…
12/12/23, 11:48 am - Jono: Then realised they’re fucking owned by city group
12/12/23, 12:17 pm - Jono: https://x.com/bryansgunn/status/1734282222000087385?s=48
12/12/23, 5:26 pm - Dave: Who would have thought signing a contract for the entirety of your prime years as a player was a bad idea?
12/12/23, 7:51 pm - Dave: Unlucky Todd https://www.premierleague.com/news/3821010?mibextid=Zxz2cZ
12/12/23, 7:53 pm - Dave: Probably better having no one in goal at this rate
12/12/23, 8:18 pm - James: Good team Bournemouth
12/12/23, 8:36 pm - Jono: https://x.com/hltco/status/1734493659708473604?s=48

Haha classic
12/12/23, 8:57 pm - James: As shit as they are, somehow, they're still in the top six. Doesn't make sense
12/12/23, 8:58 pm - James: Bit like spurs last season maybe, eventually they'll drop
12/12/23, 9:11 pm - Dave: Ten hag inherited a billion dollar squad of marquee signings. Arteta inherited the goonies
12/12/23, 9:12 pm - Dave: I’ll let the liverpool fans comment on the squad that Klopp inherited
12/12/23, 9:21 pm - Jono: I was gonna say
12/12/23, 10:44 pm - James: Manure are heading out out
12/12/23, 10:49 pm - Gerrard: True, Arteta inherited a strong squad and finished 8th 8th 5th
12/12/23, 10:50 pm - Liam: Troll
12/12/23, 10:50 pm - Dave: Not even a good troll. At least make the bait worthy of biting
12/12/23, 10:51 pm - Dave: Hear the Bayern fans chanting “it’s coming home” 😂
12/12/23, 10:51 pm - Gerrard: 2 replies in 2mins, bait was good enough
12/12/23, 10:51 pm - Liam: Lols
12/12/23, 11:04 pm - James: Manure a disgrace to English football
12/12/23, 11:04 pm - James: Finishing bottom of that group 😳
12/12/23, 11:05 pm - James: Their U19s also finished rock bottom. Future is bright
12/12/23, 11:08 pm - Dave: Hopefully they keep ten hag for the rest of the season
12/12/23, 11:09 pm - Dave: Don’t want them bringing in a new manager and suddenly finding form
12/12/23, 11:10 pm - James: Van Gaal, Mourinho, Ten Hag
12/12/23, 11:10 pm - James: Doesn't matter who they bring in
12/12/23, 11:11 pm - James: What Mourinho achieved looks incredible now
12/12/23, 11:11 pm - Dave: So @61452662705 , if you beat Milan tomorrow and dortmund beat PSG, you make it through?
12/12/23, 11:12 pm - James: Just have to better PSG result
12/12/23, 11:12 pm - James: We should be through. Was robbed in paris
12/12/23, 11:13 pm - Dave: If PSG draw, you can go through on goal difference
12/12/23, 11:13 pm - Dave: Providing you beat Milan
12/12/23, 11:13 pm - Dave: Have I got that right?
12/12/23, 11:13 pm - Gerrard: Arsenal don't have that killer instinct
12/12/23, 11:14 pm - Dave: You top of your champions league group? Oh..
12/12/23, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: Playing out a 1-1 on the last day kills momentum
12/12/23, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: Sets a bad standard
12/12/23, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: Better hope you get a weak draw on the next round
12/12/23, 11:15 pm - Dave: Not difficult to win all your games when you’re playing part time plumbers
12/12/23, 11:15 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 you're biting hard today, what's up?
12/12/23, 11:15 pm - Dave: Just friendly banter my friend. Can’t be too cosy leading up to this game on the 23rd can we
12/12/23, 11:16 pm - Gerrard: Lol
12/12/23, 11:16 pm - Gerrard: #prayyoudontgetnapoli
12/12/23, 11:17 pm - James: It's H2H first so yes anyway
12/12/23, 11:17 pm - Dave: Best part will be when I blame losing on the FA for sending arteta to the stands at anfield for his delayed “punishment” for speaking out
12/12/23, 11:18 pm - Gerrard: But he said if I speak out I'm in trouble.... Then he spoke out.... Seems self inflicted <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 11:19 pm - James: Who's winning between you two
12/12/23, 11:19 pm - James: Any money bring thrown in
12/12/23, 11:19 pm - James: Being
12/12/23, 11:19 pm - Gerrard: Whatever will be will be, stop trying to distract from Newty's garbage fire of a season
12/12/23, 11:20 pm - Gerrard: This is a stretch
12/12/23, 11:20 pm - James: Decimated with injuries but still touching distance of top 5, league cup QF to play and could get to last 16 of CL
12/12/23, 11:20 pm - James: Such garbage fire
12/12/23, 11:21 pm - Gerrard: Hey @14244893404 injuries
12/12/23, 11:21 pm - James: This isn't Varpool last season mate 😂
12/12/23, 11:21 pm - James: @14244893404 I hope you pump the smelly bastards
12/12/23, 11:21 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 injuries is why Newty suck
12/12/23, 11:22 pm - Gerrard: Not just who they are as a club
12/12/23, 11:24 pm - James: Varpool would be bottom with 14 out
12/12/23, 11:24 pm - James: Klip meltdown
12/12/23, 11:24 pm - James: Can't even take a 12:30pm kick off
12/12/23, 11:27 pm - James: @14244893404 he's such a shit troll
12/12/23, 11:27 pm - James: I preferred it when he went quiet and sulked last season
12/12/23, 11:30 pm - James: This reply also means he's scared of arsenal @14244893404
12/12/23, 11:33 pm - Gerrard: Woulda shoulda coulda, the motto of Newty FC United Corp Pty Ltd
12/12/23, 11:33 pm - Gerrard: Scared of losing the Christmas Cup
12/12/23, 11:40 pm - Dave: My moneys on a draw but who knows. It’s Anfield, I’d be over the moon if we broke the curse
12/12/23, 11:42 pm - Dave: Arteta in the stands though and Anfield, Liverpool shithousing wins every week at the moment, I’d say odds are stacked against us. Leaning more towards Liverpool win if there was a gun against my head
12/12/23, 11:45 pm - James: Shithousing wins 😳
12/12/23, 11:46 pm - James: I don't watch their games but apparently they robbed Palace last week
12/12/23, 11:46 pm - James: Ever since that Diaz incident VARpool in full force?
12/12/23, 11:47 pm - James: I saw a bit of the Fulham game and they were all over the place. Not champion material. Scored four worldies. Statistical anomaly
12/12/23, 11:53 pm - Jono: I'll take shithousing wins and being top atm any day of the week. Same way we did first half of the 19/20 season
12/12/23, 11:54 pm - Dave: It’s odd watching them play. They have moments of brilliance and then moments of total chaos. Not convincing wins but keep finding a way of picking up points. Got to take your hat off to them, mentality monsters right now
12/12/23, 11:54 pm - Jono: Still don't think we'll win it with this squad but who knows... Still think when KDB returns City will get back on the horse and surpass us all
12/12/23, 11:55 pm - Dave: Agree
12/12/23, 11:55 pm - Jono: But maybe their motivation isn't as strong this season. That's the hope i have.
12/12/23, 11:55 pm - Dave: Do you think the impending charges are affecting pep at all? He seems a bit rattled at the moment
12/12/23, 11:56 pm - James: Shut up Rodwell
12/12/23, 11:56 pm - James: Mincer
12/12/23, 11:57 pm - Gerrard: Rattle city - like Jimmity
12/12/23, 11:58 pm - James: Hope so
12/12/23, 11:58 pm - James: Good for the league to have a proper manager and proper team as champions
12/12/23, 11:58 pm - James: Can't have another Leicester
13/12/23, 12:01 am - Dave: There’s always a Leicester style anomaly every season. It was Newty last season. Villa’s turn this season
13/12/23, 12:05 am - Gerrard: Swing and a miss
13/12/23, 12:12 am - James: Varpool winning the pandemic season?

13/12/23, 12:12 am - James: Anomaly
13/12/23, 12:15 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 he's posting his own reaction gifs because nobody thinks his sledges are good enough to react to lol
13/12/23, 12:37 am - James: https://x.com/FBAwayDays/status/1734668655001043170?s=08

My favourite moment of the match
13/12/23, 12:41 am - Jono: Should probably rename him to burro fernandes (burro is donkey is spanish)
13/12/23, 12:48 am - James: Great assist Kane
13/12/23, 12:48 am - James: Lens v sevilla two soft pens
13/12/23, 12:48 am - James: Ramos went in for their keeper as usual
13/12/23, 12:48 am - Jono: Man U looked garbage
13/12/23, 12:48 am - Jono: What a fall

13/12/23, 12:51 am - Dave: Now? 😂
13/12/23, 12:52 am - Dave: There must be so much pressure on the club to boot ten hag
13/12/23, 12:52 am - Jono: They won't at all... Not while Glazers still own it
13/12/23, 12:52 am - Dave: How do you get belted 3-0 by cherries at old Trafford
13/12/23, 1:14 am - James: Good team Bournemouth
13/12/23, 1:14 am - Dave: Only since you got dicked by them 👀
13/12/23, 1:19 am - James: Remember when you got dicked by us 😳
13/12/23, 1:19 am - James: And Villa
13/12/23, 1:21 am - Dave: You still bragging about your 1-0 PGMOL gift from god
13/12/23, 1:22 am - Dave: You’ve conceded 7 in the last two games, newty got more pressing matters ahead
13/12/23, 1:22 am - Dave: Like not finishing bottom half
13/12/23, 1:22 am - Liam: Table doesn’t lie
13/12/23, 1:23 am - Liam: United have lost 7 games
13/12/23, 1:24 am - Liam: We have only play 16
13/12/23, 1:24 am - Liam: And they are still above you
13/12/23, 1:24 am - James: Long way to go ladies
13/12/23, 1:25 am - James: Haven't you learned anything from last seasons bottle job
13/12/23, 1:25 am - Liam: Could get worse for Newty
13/12/23, 1:25 am - James: Could is better than 'definitely will' in regards to worse and Varsenals season
13/12/23, 1:25 am - Dave: Imagine calling making statements like this about a club above you in the table. Negative newty Nancy
13/12/23, 1:26 am - James: This is as good as your season gets really
13/12/23, 1:26 am - James: All down hill from here init
13/12/23, 1:26 am - Liam: Through to the CL knockouts, one point off top
13/12/23, 1:26 am - Liam: Amazing season
13/12/23, 1:27 am - Dave: Newty had their day in the sun. Back to the arse end of the table. Order is restored
13/12/23, 1:27 am - James: Long long long time till May...
13/12/23, 1:27 am - Liam: Could of got kicked out the CL and be below United
13/12/23, 1:27 am - James: Richest club in the world. Most powerful man on planet earth as our owner. The prince 😍
13/12/23, 1:28 am - James: Heading 👆
13/12/23, 1:28 am - Dave: Hasn’t made much of an impact has he
13/12/23, 1:29 am - James: Varsenal already have four defeats this season 😳
13/12/23, 1:29 am - James: West Ham, Lens, Newcastle and Villa
13/12/23, 1:29 am - James: Not good away from home
13/12/23, 1:29 am - James: Scrapped past Luton
13/12/23, 1:30 am - James: Yeah, In two years bottom to top four isn't good enough
13/12/23, 1:30 am - Dave: Top of our champions league group, second in the league. Such a miserable time to be an Arsenal fan
13/12/23, 1:30 am - James: We're not Varsenal fans mate
13/12/23, 1:30 am - Dave: But now you’re heading bottom again
13/12/23, 1:33 am - Dave: You’ve got Fulham this weekend, they’ve scored 10 goals in their last 2 games and you’ve conceded 7. Trippier is banned and you’re on your third choice keeper. How you think that’s going to pan out?
13/12/23, 4:29 am - Gerrard: Facts innit
13/12/23, 4:29 am - Gerrard: Can only
13/12/23, 4:45 am - Dave: Ten hag must be praying every night he gets sacked now. Must be so over it
13/12/23, 5:05 am - James: Tbf, 3rd and a cup in first season is good for a team that never looked good
13/12/23, 5:05 am - James: They just had a rashford purple patch for three months
13/12/23, 5:06 am - James: They just have to accept they aren't what they were ten years ago
13/12/23, 5:06 am - James: It doesn't help having twats like Ferdinand, Scholes and Neville going on and on about the 'glory' years
13/12/23, 5:07 am - James: Fergie probably secretly loves they've not done anything in the league since he left
13/12/23, 5:08 am - James: Didn't even manage two wins in a group with gala and Copenhagen
13/12/23, 6:01 am - Jono: As I’ve said many times after reading excerpts from his book he’s a genius.. and also a complete narcissist
13/12/23, 6:01 am - Jono: So he knew what he was doing by bringing Moyes in
13/12/23, 6:02 am - Jono: He wanted his legacy protected for at least 4-5 seasons which have now turned to a decade
13/12/23, 6:17 am - James: He's that good!
13/12/23, 6:25 am - Jono: Contemplating his next move
13/12/23, 7:07 am - Dave: With the exception of Trent, I think that would be my 11 as well for this season
13/12/23, 7:07 am - Gerrard: 😱
13/12/23, 7:08 am - Dave: Odegaard not really hit form this season yet. Odegaard of last season would be in there in a heartbeat
13/12/23, 7:08 am - Gerrard: I'm loving your persistence of hate on Trent, same level as you persistence of thinking Arteta is gonna win something
13/12/23, 7:09 am - Dave: No hate, just think Walker is a better all rounder than Trent
13/12/23, 7:11 am - Gerrard: He can definitely make a better kebab
13/12/23, 7:11 am - James: Racism
13/12/23, 7:12 am - Gerrard: Racist thinking it was racism
13/12/23, 7:12 am - James: Enderson better as well
13/12/23, 7:12 am - James: Raya? @14244893404
13/12/23, 7:12 am - Dave: Racist
13/12/23, 7:12 am - Gerrard: Yeah Enderson is better, that blonde Danish king
13/12/23, 7:13 am - James: @14244893404 good team if you want to let in goal after goal on your right side
13/12/23, 7:13 am - Dave: Not over Alisson in a month of Sundays
13/12/23, 7:14 am - James: @14244893404 only three Varsenal players but four Varpool?
13/12/23, 7:14 am - Dave: Would argue that Alisson is Liverpools most important player along with Salah. Would be in trouble without either
13/12/23, 7:15 am - James: Afcon next year no Salah
13/12/23, 7:15 am - Dave: Well I’d have salah and alisson in my team 100%. Toss up between Virgil and Gabriel. Virgil’s definitely looking better this season.
13/12/23, 7:15 am - Dave: No Trent
13/12/23, 7:16 am - Dave: So I’d have 2/3 liverpool players and 3/4 arsenal players and 5 city players <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 7:16 am - James: Rumours circulating the Saudis want a big money GK for their league and Bucket is top of their list
13/12/23, 7:17 am - James: Less delusional
13/12/23, 7:18 am - Dave: What are yours? Can be any prem team
13/12/23, 7:18 am - James: Son is in
13/12/23, 7:18 am - James: Maybe Douglas Luiz

13/12/23, 7:19 am - James: Fast
13/12/23, 7:19 am - James: Big Dom Solanke instead of alien man
13/12/23, 7:22 am - Gerrard: More delusional
13/12/23, 7:23 am - Gerrard: Who do we think is gonna come in for any of the Newty players during the January transfer window?
13/12/23, 7:24 am - Liam: Ramsdale
13/12/23, 7:26 am - Dave: Van de vin? That his name?
13/12/23, 7:27 am - Dave: Son over saka?
13/12/23, 7:28 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 stop laughing, I'm being serious
13/12/23, 7:28 am - Dave: Hopefully Saudi come for that miserable cunt Bruno, no one can stand the sight of him
13/12/23, 7:28 am - Gerrard: Issac could be off to Spain
13/12/23, 7:29 am - Dave: Bullshit, where you hearing that
13/12/23, 7:29 am - Gerrard: Just he's sooooooo good
13/12/23, 7:29 am - Gerrard: Barca and Real struggling
13/12/23, 7:29 am - Gerrard: Plus you know...... CL football next year
13/12/23, 7:30 am - Dave: Ah you’re taking the piss lol
13/12/23, 7:30 am - Gerrard: Lol
13/12/23, 7:30 am - Gerrard: Guilty
13/12/23, 7:31 am - Gerrard: Caught Saudi oil blood money red handed
13/12/23, 7:33 am - Gerrard: What if United come for Howie?
13/12/23, 7:34 am - Dave: Reckon he’d snap their hand off?
13/12/23, 7:34 am - James: @14244893404 think FSG will reinvest the money the Newcastle owners get for bucket and salad?
13/12/23, 7:34 am - Gerrard: Better project? Prestige
13/12/23, 7:35 am - James: Isak is a gun
13/12/23, 7:35 am - Dave: True. Bigger club I guess
13/12/23, 7:35 am - James: Varpool would be better with him than Mexico carroll
13/12/23, 7:35 am - James: Manure bigger than both your clubs tbf
13/12/23, 7:35 am - James: Way bigger than varsenal
13/12/23, 7:35 am - Dave: Of course it is
13/12/23, 7:36 am - James: You admit that
13/12/23, 7:36 am - James: Varpool boy wouldn't ever
13/12/23, 7:36 am - Gerrard: No shit, check the facts
13/12/23, 7:36 am - Dave: Didn’t say it isn’t. Just saying Howie would jump at the opportunity to manage Yanited
13/12/23, 7:36 am - James: I bet Jezzy lezzy reckons Varpool are bigger
13/12/23, 7:36 am - Gerrard: Liverpool are like 4th or 5th in the world
13/12/23, 7:36 am - James: Jezbian the lesbian
13/12/23, 7:37 am - Gerrard: Can't help all those Asians around during the 90s and 00s
13/12/23, 7:37 am - James: Ya it was good when Varpool got all of England banned from Europe
13/12/23, 7:37 am - James: Helped the cause
13/12/23, 7:37 am - Dave: For 5 fucking years 😢
13/12/23, 7:38 am - Gerrard: UEFA are cowards innit
13/12/23, 7:38 am - Gerrard: But it did stop Everton being bigger than Arsenal so you're welcome
13/12/23, 7:38 am - Dave: That was when we were supposed to win it as well. We’d have multiple European trophies if it wasn’t for Liverpool fans 😔
13/12/23, 7:39 am - James: You wouldn't be in top division if you hadn't paid to be in tbf
13/12/23, 7:39 am - Gerrard: You making stuff up? It was Everton that were gun then

13/12/23, 7:40 am - Dave: Tottenham are not a big club.
13/12/23, 7:41 am - Dave: Drives me nuts when I hear that
13/12/23, 7:41 am - James: You're buying one of the best venues in the world if you buy spurs <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 7:41 am - James: PSG were formed in 1970
13/12/23, 7:41 am - James: Citeh didn't exist before takeovers
13/12/23, 7:42 am - James: Real Madrid are prestigious because they're owned by the royal family
13/12/23, 7:43 am - James: Manure only got big because of Munich disaster. Don't think they were that great prior or not as great
13/12/23, 7:43 am - James: Varpool only got big once the moores outspent everyone to get them out the lowest league
13/12/23, 7:43 am - James: Varsenal only got anywhere because they paid to be in the top division
13/12/23, 7:44 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 ol' Jimmity has a very strange way of thinking about things eh
13/12/23, 7:44 am - James: Jezzy trying another angle

13/12/23, 7:45 am - James: Mr Beast is bigger than everything ever
13/12/23, 7:45 am - Dave: Well over 100 years ago. Didn’t we all pay to be in it?
13/12/23, 7:45 am - James: No
13/12/23, 7:46 am - Dave: So if your owners spent no money from tomorrow for the next 5 seasons, would you still be in the prem?
13/12/23, 7:46 am - James: You paid to be in a competition
13/12/23, 7:46 am - Dave: We’re all paying to be in the prem
13/12/23, 7:46 am - James: You didn't get promoted
13/12/23, 7:46 am - James: Or earn it
13/12/23, 7:46 am - James: It's like paying for all the best Fifa cards because you can't be arsed to grind
13/12/23, 7:47 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 keep up that grind though bro
13/12/23, 7:47 am - James: It's our turn to spunk the cash just like you gays did
13/12/23, 7:47 am - James: *guys

13/12/23, 7:50 am - Dave: Richest club in the world hasn’t won a trophy since the 50s
13/12/23, 7:51 am - James: Forgot you guys like going to the past when you get rattled
13/12/23, 7:51 am - James: Like women
13/12/23, 7:51 am - Gerrard: Can talk about how shit Newty are currently if you'd like
13/12/23, 7:52 am - James: Pair of two holes givin it the biggin
13/12/23, 7:52 am - Dave: Seen 80m dropped on a gambling addict and 80m dropped on “the next Henry”. Couldn’t wipe Henry’s arse
13/12/23, 7:52 am - James: Some exaggerating on those fees there 😳
13/12/23, 7:53 am - James: Past and then lies
13/12/23, 7:53 am - James: Classic
13/12/23, 7:53 am - Gerrard: Did the next Henry win top goal scorer last year or is he up there this season?
13/12/23, 7:53 am - Gerrard: I keep hearing how good he is
13/12/23, 7:55 am - Dave: This year clearly. Halaand who?
13/12/23, 7:56 am - James: Check the stats
13/12/23, 7:56 am - James: Lots of sub appearances and I bet he's scored more than nuni
13/12/23, 7:56 am - James: In less games...
13/12/23, 7:56 am - James: Bet he has a strike rate of 1 in 2
13/12/23, 7:57 am - James: £100m on that donut
13/12/23, 7:57 am - James: Doh
13/12/23, 8:00 am - Dave: 4 goals
13/12/23, 8:00 am - James: How many games each played
13/12/23, 8:01 am - James: Remember when we were meant to be comparing noncez to haaland 😂
13/12/23, 8:02 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 you pick em
13/12/23, 8:02 am - Louie: Wait till Lisandro Martinez is back, he’s our Rodri.
13/12/23, 8:23 am - James: Including last season?
13/12/23, 8:23 am - James: What is it then
13/12/23, 8:25 am - Gerrard: Issac
13/12/23, 8:25 am - Gerrard: Nunez
13/12/23, 8:26 am - Gerrard: Per 90 is the real indicator
13/12/23, 8:26 am - James: @14244893404 all those assists because he hit the bar or post with an open goal 😂
13/12/23, 8:27 am - Dave: No that’s just this season

13/12/23, 8:31 am - Dave: This is including last season @61452662705 @61409710717. Isak is clear by a country mile, let’s be honest.
13/12/23, 8:32 am - Dave: Nunez gets fed so many chances, mind blowing how he’s not burying these
13/12/23, 8:32 am - James: @14244893404 noncez' stats no better in all comps even when playing in the euro farmer league 😂
13/12/23, 8:33 am - James: @14244893404 at least ten of Isak appearances from bench when rotating with Wilson who is also a better striker than noncy <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 8:51 am - Gerrard: No way Rodders, better teammate

13/12/23, 10:48 pm - James: Varsenal mentality

13/12/23, 10:48 pm - James: Fuck Europa League
13/12/23, 10:48 pm - Dave: Embarasing isn’t it. Shows you how last season was a total anomaly for third and fourth
13/12/23, 10:49 pm - Jono: Massively

13/12/23, 10:50 pm - Dave: What you on about
13/12/23, 10:50 pm - James: Lens and who else was in it
13/12/23, 10:50 pm - Jono: The Europa League specialists
13/12/23, 10:50 pm - James: Sevilla?
13/12/23, 10:50 pm - Jono: Looked like a Europa group to be fair
13/12/23, 10:50 pm - Jono: Yeah
13/12/23, 10:50 pm - James: They're 17th in the league

13/12/23, 10:51 pm - Dave: Very tough group

13/12/23, 10:51 pm - James: Unless we score two
13/12/23, 10:52 pm - Jono: Very quiet at St James
13/12/23, 10:52 pm - Dave: Look, all I know is you can only beat what’s in front of you ❤️ 🤍
13/12/23, 10:52 pm - James: Agree
13/12/23, 10:52 pm - Jono: At least you had that PSG win
13/12/23, 10:52 pm - James: Happy with that
13/12/23, 10:52 pm - Jono: Great moment for the club
13/12/23, 10:52 pm - Jono: Levelz
13/12/23, 10:52 pm - James: 20 years no CL
13/12/23, 10:52 pm - James: Group of Death
13/12/23, 10:52 pm - James: In it to the last whistle
13/12/23, 10:52 pm - Jono: Can really see Newy scoring here
13/12/23, 10:53 pm - Jono: To ruin Jimmy's day a little more
13/12/23, 10:53 pm - James: Dubravka
13/12/23, 10:54 pm - Jono: Phillips got a start today for Man City.... Pep trying to squeeze some value out of his sale
13/12/23, 10:55 pm - Dave: Nearly 3 there
13/12/23, 10:55 pm - Dave: Ouch
13/12/23, 10:55 pm - Dave: Imagine what this is doing to newtys confidence week in week out
13/12/23, 10:56 pm - Dave: @61452662705 reckon Howe is gone by end of the season? “He took us as far as we can go, we now welcome…. “ <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 10:56 pm - Jono: Howe won't survive long term <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 10:57 pm - James: Dubs looks like someone who has never played in goal before
13/12/23, 10:57 pm - Jono: Not if the owners want trophies
13/12/23, 10:57 pm - James: Fuck is wrong with him
13/12/23, 10:57 pm - Jono: Bring in Karius
13/12/23, 10:58 pm - James: That was a dog shit second half
13/12/23, 10:58 pm - Dave: He’s shit but your back line is cooked right now
13/12/23, 10:58 pm - Dave: Long way off from the cries of best defence in the league
13/12/23, 10:58 pm - James: Trippier and Gordon subs went well
13/12/23, 10:58 pm - James: Both cooked though
13/12/23, 10:58 pm - Liam: Newy kick off after every game
13/12/23, 10:59 pm - Dave: You think newty will buy in Jan?
13/12/23, 10:59 pm - James: Milan aren't even celebrating
13/12/23, 10:59 pm - James: Shows what a wank comp Euro League is
13/12/23, 10:59 pm - Dave: Why would they? Expected to beat you 👀
13/12/23, 10:59 pm - Dave: It’s like city beating Luton
13/12/23, 11:00 pm - James: Not you guys though
13/12/23, 11:00 pm - James: Fuck me that was like you'd won the CL
13/12/23, 11:00 pm - James: That night in Luton...
13/12/23, 11:00 pm - Dave: Can’t believe you’re happy about not getting into Europa
13/12/23, 11:01 pm - Dave: Good opportunity to end the 70 year trophy drought mate
13/12/23, 11:20 pm - Gerrard: 💯
13/12/23, 11:20 pm - Gerrard: Need a winning mentality
14/12/23, 12:00 am - Dave: Wow. Brutal
14/12/23, 12:04 am - Pero: Does that mean only 3 teams now ? Or not 5 ?
14/12/23, 12:10 am - Gerrard: I think not 5
14/12/23, 12:11 am - Liam: Nothing we need to worry about my friend.
14/12/23, 12:11 am - Gerrard: Will be good seeing Villa in the CL again, they got the pedigree
14/12/23, 12:35 am - Jono: Top 4
14/12/23, 12:35 am - Jono: Instead of top 5
14/12/23, 1:52 am - Gerrard: Ouch
14/12/23, 4:04 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/jug3zMtCfoM?si=WVzJVO2zvf6sx2Wq
14/12/23, 4:40 am - Gerrard: Just saw Almiron's Nunez miss
14/12/23, 5:11 am - Pero: When the defender pinched it off him from the line , what a tackle
14/12/23, 5:14 am - Pero: Just saw shakhtar vs Porto. Shakhtar's first goal was another referring disgrace. Linesman lifts flag for offside, Porto stop, Linesman put flag down, shakhtar play on and score. Var calls a goal 😂

14/12/23, 9:15 am - Gerrard: Play the whistle innit
14/12/23, 9:16 am - Gerrard: I think it's been such a waste giving our CL spot to Newcastle this season, just don't belong there.
14/12/23, 9:16 am - Jono: Karma for the PL
14/12/23, 9:16 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/pYptr93aPbQ?si=z8kOVtY5GLx5uRnt
14/12/23, 9:17 am - Jono: Letting a flog team get owned by Saudi cunts
14/12/23, 9:17 am - Jono: There goes their extra CL spot
14/12/23, 9:17 am - Gerrard: Looked so confident
14/12/23, 9:35 am - Jono: Fuck me Newcastle lost to a team wearing those hideous strips
14/12/23, 9:35 am - Jono: Nice goal from big fuck Joelinton
14/12/23, 9:36 am - Jono: Geez that save off Bruno G’s shot was magic
14/12/23, 10:51 am - Gerrard: Did y'all see Barca???
14/12/23, 7:36 pm - Dave: Poor bloke. English isn’t his first language and he’s being punished for it 😢
14/12/23, 7:37 pm - Jono: Reminds me of Suarez
14/12/23, 8:07 pm - James: Only a matter of time. Women players and men's players playing together 😍
14/12/23, 9:33 pm - James: Was told by certain arsenal players 😂
14/12/23, 9:34 pm - James: Honestly, you guys are fucking cooked
14/12/23, 9:34 pm - James: It's been over 40 days now
14/12/23, 9:35 pm - James: You lost a game you deserved nothing from
14/12/23, 9:35 pm - James: You lost legitimately to Villa as well
14/12/23, 9:35 pm - James: You'll probably lose at anfield too
14/12/23, 9:35 pm - James: Accept it
14/12/23, 9:36 pm - James: Arteta can't control his emotions because he has the mentality of a dog or child
14/12/23, 9:38 pm - Gerrard: What????
14/12/23, 9:38 pm - Gerrard: Arteta got off?
14/12/23, 9:48 pm - Dave: Innocent
14/12/23, 9:48 pm - Gerrard: .....but we all saw it
14/12/23, 9:48 pm - Dave: Once a gunner always a gunner. At least he’s honest. Poor lad wanted to come home probably, your toxic club tipped him over the edge
14/12/23, 9:49 pm - Dave: Saw what?
14/12/23, 9:49 pm - Dave: https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67719803.amp
14/12/23, 9:52 pm - Gerrard: Him bring the game into disrepute
14/12/23, 9:55 pm - James: Again
14/12/23, 9:55 pm - James: Arsenal and their fans have become the worst in the league now by a mile
14/12/23, 9:56 pm - James: They've just taken over Chelsea's mantle because they got top four last season
14/12/23, 9:57 pm - James: They'll go quiet soon once they start slipping back down the ladder
14/12/23, 10:03 pm - Gerrard: The PL can't be taken seriously after this
14/12/23, 10:04 pm - Dave: Silently shitting your pants because he’ll be on the sideline at Anfield now
14/12/23, 10:04 pm - Dave: We’re not Newcastle jimmety
14/12/23, 10:15 pm - James: Two of the biggest bellends in the prem side by side on the touchline. Will be embarrassing for the league once a decision goes against one of them
14/12/23, 10:16 pm - Dave: 😮😮😮
14/12/23, 10:21 pm - Gerrard: Jimmity, between me and you.... your starting to look a little bit bitter from the whole Newty falling apart thing
14/12/23, 10:22 pm - James: Did you lose to these!?!
14/12/23, 10:23 pm - Gerrard: Hey Newty doesn't have exclusive rights to losing
14/12/23, 10:23 pm - James: Klopp OK!?
14/12/23, 10:24 pm - Gerrard: Thank you, I thought that was a good sledge
14/12/23, 10:24 pm - James: Did his pre match centre circle stare down not work on union de Brussels Belgium? <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 10:25 pm - Gerrard: 🤣 you're getting desperate now, he played the kids in a dead rubber
14/12/23, 10:26 pm - James: U19s should be able to beat them comfortably 😂😂😂
14/12/23, 10:26 pm - James: Dunno that table looks close...
14/12/23, 10:26 pm - Gerrard: Jimmity just stop, keep your head down until Newty wins again
14/12/23, 10:26 pm - James: Varpool 13pts, Toulouse 12pts
14/12/23, 10:26 pm - James: Almost didn't top it
14/12/23, 10:27 pm - James: 😵‍💫
14/12/23, 10:28 pm - James: Big game for Varsenal at the weekend. Brighton got form at the Emirates...
14/12/23, 10:30 pm - Gerrard: Jim, it's ok, stop
15/12/23, 1:39 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 Brighton are the biggest false hype of the year
15/12/23, 1:58 am - Dave: They’ve had a tough run of fixtures this year so far. Haven’t really dropped a lot of points against big clubs
15/12/23, 2:01 am - Dave: Biggest false hype of the year is Newty. No offence James, understand you’ve been ravaged by injuries
15/12/23, 2:04 am - Jono: Agreed on Newtle
15/12/23, 2:04 am - Jono: They’re back to sucking arse
15/12/23, 2:08 am - James: So loud in here atm
15/12/23, 2:09 am - James: Was nice when I was banned and or Jez instructed the group to stay quiet 😬
15/12/23, 2:14 am - Gerrard: Do you want me to kick you out so you don't endure more punishment?
Like a sympathy exile.
15/12/23, 2:15 am - James: Before pool v senal?
15/12/23, 2:15 am - James: Poolvarsenal
15/12/23, 2:15 am - James: I want to see the fireworks
15/12/23, 2:16 am - Gerrard: Psyche, not letting you get off easy after how you destroyed this group chat by entering it.
15/12/23, 2:16 am - Gerrard: So toxic.
15/12/23, 2:16 am - Gerrard: @14244893404
15/12/23, 2:16 am - James: This group chat is wank
15/12/23, 2:16 am - Gerrard: Then leave
15/12/23, 2:19 am - ~ James left
15/12/23, 2:31 am - Pero: 😮
15/12/23, 2:43 am - Dave: 😱

15/12/23, 3:08 am - JD: 🪇
15/12/23, 3:17 am - Chris: Lol John.
15/12/23, 3:21 am - Jono: JD contribution

15/12/23, 3:47 am - Pero: Ref... dust !
15/12/23, 3:48 am - JD: Hahaha
15/12/23, 4:20 am - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣
15/12/23, 4:21 am - Gerrard: He only sings when he's winning I guess
15/12/23, 4:23 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 @61478754484 for reference, once during a game Johnny complained to the referee after someone did some doughies in the carpark next to the field and caused a big cloud of dust to cover our goals and goalie.
15/12/23, 4:24 am - Pero: It was the funniest complaint to the ref I've ever heard
15/12/23, 4:24 am - Gerrard: Once you hear the inflection he used you'll crack up
15/12/23, 4:29 am - Gerrard: Biggest rattle job yet
15/12/23, 6:10 am - Dave: Done Kane dirty

15/12/23, 7:04 am - Jono: Haven’t seen the highlights
15/12/23, 7:51 am - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/shorts/DeCDFoJuitc?si=PiglaP1YzbjEmK2q
15/12/23, 7:53 am - Pero: Did even realise you played. And James left the group without hanging shit on Liverpool's defeat 😮😮
15/12/23, 7:54 am - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/shorts/n7V27b9eL8c?si=c2zXvQI-t421llSS
15/12/23, 7:55 am - Gerrard: Nah, he did try to before he left
15/12/23, 7:56 am - Pero: Ah ok I'd be extremely worried about him if he didn't
15/12/23, 2:04 pm - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/shorts/3l91DXi-ZPE?si=W-L7YZwigYQP5Kp8

16/12/23, 9:18 am - Pero: 🤣🤣🤣 disgrace means something different in Spanish,  cmon we all in this together
16/12/23, 9:21 am - Dave: All I know, is he’s going to be throwing hands, over celebrating pitch side for the rest of the season and I’m over the moon. Wasn’t the same at Villa park
16/12/23, 9:27 am - Gerrard: He's had his balls clipped

17/12/23, 12:36 am - Dave: You think that donkey Nunez going to lift the trophy for you
17/12/23, 12:36 am - Gerrard: Arteta is the biggest entitled cunty woman in the league
17/12/23, 12:36 am - Gerrard: He's more entitled than Jimmity with his Saudi money
17/12/23, 12:37 am - Gerrard: Saka doesn't have it in him to score a penalty let alone a fucking league title
17/12/23, 12:37 am - Dave: Arteta is just smarter than klippety. Got away with it because he knew how to play the system. Flopp just bent over and took it
17/12/23, 12:38 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 is that enough for a screenshot?
17/12/23, 12:38 am - Dave: 🤞
17/12/23, 1:06 am - Pero: He was animated on the field when the penalty was awarded. But in the post match interview he walked off before the reporter closed the interview , there was no thank you or anything. He was agitated hard
17/12/23, 1:19 am - Jono: He hates not winning we all know that. But he really takes his hate to a new level with Roy hey. Small handshake not even an acknowledgment that it was a well fought game. The fact a a guy on deaths door has out coached him over the years shows hard when it comes to pep’s behaviour towards old Roy
17/12/23, 1:54 am - Dave: Must be pretty irritating to get done by Roy to be fair. Wrinkled pigeon head over there cackling his arse off at you
17/12/23, 8:24 am - Jono: <Media omitted>
17/12/23, 8:25 am - Jono: Geez that escalated quick
17/12/23, 8:25 am - Jono: Jimmy must’ve left the group to go on a save Eddie mission
17/12/23, 4:13 pm - Jono: Brighton are such fucksticks
17/12/23, 4:15 pm - Dave: We have such an issue getting it in the back of the net right now
17/12/23, 4:17 pm - Dave: All the creativity in the world, chance after chance. Total domination. Struggle to finish though. Should be 3+ up
17/12/23, 4:36 pm - Jono: Brighton have not once looked like scoring which gives me an air of confidence a late one is coming 🤞🏼
17/12/23, 4:42 pm - Jono: Fuuuuuuck
17/12/23, 4:43 pm - Jono: That was it
17/12/23, 6:44 pm - Jono: We’ve been terrible
17/12/23, 7:05 pm - Dave: United are getting into this
17/12/23, 7:05 pm - Dave: You need to bury it fast. United starting to believe
17/12/23, 7:05 pm - Jono: Konate more of a threat in attack than Diaz or Darwin
17/12/23, 7:08 pm - Dave: Darwin is dog shit
17/12/23, 7:24 pm - Dave: Has Salah lost his pace?
17/12/23, 7:26 pm - Jono: Dalot is quick - almost as quick as the ref dishing out the double yellow to him 😅
17/12/23, 7:27 pm - Jono: Poor game all round. Arsenal proving today they’re the only title winning looking team today
17/12/23, 7:27 pm - Jono: Over to you now
17/12/23, 7:29 pm - Dave: Please don’t 😂
17/12/23, 7:30 pm - Jono: https://x.com/meninblazers/status/1736452183887872300?s=48
17/12/23, 8:19 pm - Chandra: 34 shots? That can't be right?
17/12/23, 8:26 pm - Jono: Yep
17/12/23, 8:26 pm - Jono: 30 of them blocked by Varane <This message was edited>
17/12/23, 8:27 pm - Gerrard: Boring
17/12/23, 8:29 pm - Gerrard: Gotta love the reactionary attitude of EPL fans

17/12/23, 8:38 pm - Chandra: One game where Onana actually saved something ?
17/12/23, 8:55 pm - Jono: He made a few regulation saves
17/12/23, 8:55 pm - ~ Dave added James
17/12/23, 8:55 pm - Jono: His centre backs did the job
17/12/23, 8:55 pm - James: Hey

17/12/23, 8:55 pm - James: @14244893404 asked me to come back

17/12/23, 8:58 pm - James: <Media omitted>
17/12/23, 8:58 pm - Jono: Nothing lol
17/12/23, 8:59 pm - James: @61413646755 thought Jez said they'd win 8-0?
17/12/23, 8:59 pm - James: Did Jonny Evans have a blinder?
17/12/23, 9:00 pm - Gerrard: Coming in late in the year, award for most pathetic
17/12/23, 9:00 pm - Gerrard: Jimmity
17/12/23, 9:00 pm - Jono: Varane did. Evans was just along for the ride
17/12/23, 9:01 pm - James: This one stings don't it 😂
17/12/23, 9:01 pm - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣
17/12/23, 9:01 pm - James: Expectation must have been we're going to pump yhese
17/12/23, 9:02 pm - Gerrard: Giving it the biggun because Liverpool didn't win 🤣
17/12/23, 9:02 pm - James: Jezzy getting all excited to watch the three min highlights when he woke up
17/12/23, 9:02 pm - Gerrard: Newty, Newty, Newty!
17/12/23, 9:02 pm - James: Fucking hell
17/12/23, 9:02 pm - James: Even we've beat manure twice already this year 😂
17/12/23, 9:02 pm - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣
17/12/23, 9:02 pm - James: Jezzy we can talk about it at din dins
17/12/23, 9:03 pm - James: Jezzy did noncy play today?
17/12/23, 9:03 pm - Gerrard: Can't believe he's actually buzzing that Liverpool didn't win a game
17/12/23, 9:03 pm - James: How many chances he miss?
17/12/23, 9:03 pm - Gerrard: Low bar with Newty fans these days
17/12/23, 9:03 pm - James: Who doesn't beat man utd at home!?
17/12/23, 9:04 pm - James: Was that there first point away to a team in the top 10?
17/12/23, 9:04 pm - Gerrard: 🤣
17/12/23, 9:07 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 think it would've been better for him to keep his head down until 2024
17/12/23, 9:08 pm - James: Back down to earth for Varpool fans this morning
17/12/23, 9:12 pm - Dave: Didn’t cherries just rip their pants down 3-0 at Old Trafford?
17/12/23, 9:12 pm - Gerrard: Stop baiting him, meanie
17/12/23, 9:12 pm - Dave: Onana was prime Buffon today
17/12/23, 9:12 pm - James: Solanke > Nunez
17/12/23, 9:13 pm - Dave: Havertz > Nunez. More goals this season
17/12/23, 9:13 pm - Dave: Havertz isn’t even a striker, let alone 100m 😬
17/12/23, 9:14 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 so you going to stoke his fire

17/12/23, 9:18 pm - Dave: Really good game actually. Could have gone either way. Competitive
17/12/23, 9:20 pm - James: Precisely why Varpool won't win the league. That was manures b team lol
17/12/23, 9:21 pm - Dave: Not saying too much. We’ll be there next weekend

17/12/23, 9:36 pm - Dave: Proper arrogance. Chop his pony tail off
17/12/23, 9:37 pm - Dave: “Only one team came to win” 

Why didn’t you win then mucca. It’s a deeeeessssgrace!
17/12/23, 9:55 pm - Gerrard: World isn't fair innit
17/12/23, 10:57 pm - James: What happened? Onana is one of the worst keepers the league has ever seen and he kept a cleansheet this morning with Jonny Evans at CB
17/12/23, 10:59 pm - Dave: Wasn’t really tested. Only one decent shot and Onana had cat reflexes 🐈
17/12/23, 11:00 pm - James: But they have Nooni up top?
17/12/23, 11:03 pm - James: <Media omitted>

17/12/23, 11:06 pm - James: @14244893404 Neville saying anfield atmosphere was pathetic
17/12/23, 11:06 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 I think he's traded in his Brown Ale jersey for a United one
17/12/23, 11:09 pm - James: https://x.com/SkySportsPL/status/1736461029335351495?s=08
17/12/23, 11:10 pm - James: Roy with a comment that burns ten seconds in lol

17/12/23, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: Get him out
17/12/23, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: #nunezout
17/12/23, 11:15 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 I want what I messaged you direct noted for the group chat records
17/12/23, 11:16 pm - Gerrard: I also request you tell Jimmity Ten Hag that you tricked him back
17/12/23, 11:21 pm - James: https://x.com/UTDEmma_/status/1736502241375174886?s=08
17/12/23, 11:21 pm - Jono: In fairness that was 8 years ago and everyone gave us hell for that
17/12/23, 11:22 pm - Gerrard: Living in the past Jimmity Ten Hag, breaking your own rules innit
17/12/23, 11:23 pm - Jono: In those 8 years…
Newty were relegated…twice
17/12/23, 11:24 pm - James: Oh gawd what's Newcastle got to do with any of this...
17/12/23, 11:25 pm - James: 😂
17/12/23, 11:25 pm - James: 🪇🪇🪇
17/12/23, 11:25 pm - Gerrard: I wasn't gonna stoop to Jimmity Ten Hag's level and talk about how he can't be talking
17/12/23, 11:25 pm - Gerrard: But you do you
17/12/23, 11:25 pm - Jono: It’s okay jimmy will leave the group again first week of Jan

18/12/23, 12:08 am - Gerrard: @61422023136 @61478754484 do we want to get together to watch the game on Sunday delayed, maybe 8or9am?
18/12/23, 12:15 am - Liam: Keen
18/12/23, 12:15 am - Gerrard: My place?
18/12/23, 12:16 am - Liam: Ya can do
18/12/23, 12:16 am - Liam: Not keen on 430am lol
18/12/23, 12:16 am - Gerrard: Nah delayed, we'll just mute Jimmity until we watch the game
18/12/23, 12:18 am - James: I'll be coming at you from all angles
18/12/23, 12:19 am - James: Sending telegrams if I have to
18/12/23, 12:19 am - Gerrard: @61478754484 imagine a world where Jimmity has more than posting in here
18/12/23, 12:20 am - Gerrard: Enjoying Christmas without posting in here
18/12/23, 12:22 am - James: Barbershop quartet at your door
18/12/23, 12:23 am - Gerrard: Christmas cup winners have to buy breakfast
18/12/23, 12:26 am - Gerrard: *Jimmity left the group January 2nd 7.10am
18/12/23, 12:31 am - Pero: In
18/12/23, 12:32 am - Dave: If they play like they did today we’ll hammer them. But it’s Liverpool. They won’t, I’m sure it’ll be a tight game
18/12/23, 12:33 am - Gerrard: Looks like United fans are starting to get butt hurt
18/12/23, 12:33 am - Dave: Full blown meltdown by Liverpool fans all over socials. Very entitled to be this upset with a draw
18/12/23, 12:33 am - Gerrard: I need to start a YouTube channel for the reasonable Livo fans
18/12/23, 12:51 am - James: Need to remember where they came from last season
18/12/23, 12:51 am - Dave: Van djik living in United fans heads after his post match interview
18/12/23, 12:51 am - Dave: A point against United isn’t a terrible result
18/12/23, 12:51 am - James: Been very lucky with fixture schedule, clown euro competition and no injuries
18/12/23, 12:51 am - James: Will get hard next year
18/12/23, 12:51 am - Dave: Not sure why everyone is so upset
18/12/23, 12:51 am - James: They're a bigger club
18/12/23, 12:54 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/FgHSehO8mQ0?si=0NVFKyrZdSwuEn8M
Both teams came out looking bad
18/12/23, 12:55 am - Gerrard: Just disappointing.
When a "proper" team parks it, it gets hard but Livo played bad.
18/12/23, 1:14 am - James: Suuure buddy
18/12/23, 2:40 am - Gerrard: Poor cunt doesn't feel anything anymore
18/12/23, 2:41 am - Liam: Gary Neville said it was a proper dead atmosphere
18/12/23, 2:41 am - Gerrard: Quiet before Christmas
18/12/23, 2:42 am - Gerrard: Everyone winding down
18/12/23, 2:56 am - James: Winding down the players windows
18/12/23, 2:56 am - James: Great time for the natives to rob up the players houses
18/12/23, 2:57 am - James: Gucci under the Christmas trees
18/12/23, 3:39 am - Dave: Agree. But United aren’t title contenders
18/12/23, 3:46 am - Gerrard: Jesus, who said they werem
18/12/23, 3:46 am - Gerrard: ?
18/12/23, 3:50 am - Gerrard: Hag did?
18/12/23, 4:24 am - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣🪇🪇🪇
18/12/23, 5:03 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 you got a scouse brother?
18/12/23, 5:06 am - Dave: That a scouse accent is it? Thought a self proclaimed paddy would recognise one of their own
18/12/23, 5:09 am - James: Wow
18/12/23, 5:09 am - James: Thought he was Mexican
18/12/23, 5:11 am - James: Just a matter of time for the rot to start to show. Less than convincing really. Losing to bad teams in Europa too. Fulham game was a mess and lucky away to palace @14244893404
18/12/23, 5:17 am - James: https://youtu.be/QtPyjjxkd5I?feature=shared
18/12/23, 5:17 am - James: Seems rattled
18/12/23, 5:17 am - James: Wonder if he'd have said that if they won
18/12/23, 5:19 am - James: https://youtu.be/5I8Ami2lZ_E?feature=shared
18/12/23, 5:20 am - James: https://youtu.be/J3gVjIduFVQ?feature=shared

18/12/23, 5:57 am - Gerrard: I apologise @14244893404
18/12/23, 5:58 am - Pero: Welcome back Jimmy!
18/12/23, 5:59 am - Gerrard: Definitely a different vibe with and without Jimmity
18/12/23, 6:00 am - James: Can't wait to see Jezzy later and talk about the game. Minute to minute breakdown 🙂
18/12/23, 6:01 am - Dave: 1-3 minutes
18/12/23, 6:01 am - Gerrard: "I've got things to do first" 
On here messaging I see
18/12/23, 6:01 am - Dave: Got to lay the foundations for a riveting night ahead ❤️
18/12/23, 6:01 am - Pero: So many goals to discuss
18/12/23, 6:01 am - Gerrard: Sadly got bigger things to discuss than foitball
18/12/23, 6:02 am - Gerrard: Football
18/12/23, 6:02 am - Dave: “And then, Nunez missed another one!”
18/12/23, 6:02 am - Gerrard: 3min only had one miss from him
18/12/23, 6:02 am - James: Which game. Don't have all night
18/12/23, 6:03 am - Gerrard: Gakpo and Trent should've scored
18/12/23, 6:03 am - James: Stop with the foreplay
18/12/23, 6:03 am - James: Save it for later babe
18/12/23, 6:03 am - Pero: Poor poonez I saw one header attempt on goal which turned into an accidental potential assist cross goal then salah missed
18/12/23, 6:04 am - Dave: 34 shots and no goals has to be a record
18/12/23, 6:04 am - James: Onana didn't really make a save as well
18/12/23, 6:04 am - Gerrard: But I do encourage the Arsenal fans to keep talking ahead of this weekend please
18/12/23, 6:04 am - James: Hojlanders chance was the best one
18/12/23, 6:05 am - Gerrard: Jimmity didn't watch the highlights, exposed
18/12/23, 6:05 am - Dave: Let’s clear this up. Me giving you shit for playing woefully today doesn’t negate the fact I’m anxious as fuck about next weekend
18/12/23, 6:05 am - Gerrard: Keep going
18/12/23, 6:05 am - James: Dick van Dyke header straight at him
18/12/23, 6:06 am - James: Not sure what else he did
18/12/23, 6:06 am - James: Saw Alisson save the day again
18/12/23, 6:06 am - Gerrard: Weeks of frustration coming out
18/12/23, 6:07 am - Dave: So thirsty to end that Anfield drought
18/12/23, 6:07 am - Dave: Hope arteta has the speakers out this week
18/12/23, 6:07 am - James: Unplugged this time I assume
18/12/23, 6:08 am - James: Can hear a pin drop at anfield nowadays
18/12/23, 6:09 am - Jono: Thanks Jimmity Neville
18/12/23, 6:11 am - Gerrard: Yeah saw the United cronies going for it today
18/12/23, 6:11 am - Dave: Van Disney rattled them hard
18/12/23, 6:12 am - Jono: Keano saying to show respect
18/12/23, 6:12 am - Gerrard: They need to just understand who they are now
18/12/23, 6:12 am - Dave: “I felt nothing” @61452662705
18/12/23, 6:13 am - Jono: Despite respectfully breaking legs in revenge acts during his playing career
18/12/23, 6:13 am - Gerrard: Told you already, poor kid is dead inside already from those Manc supporter's treatment
18/12/23, 6:13 am - Dave: At least we don’t have xhaka anymore to awaken the crowd at anfield
18/12/23, 6:13 am - Gerrard: Hey ease up on Keano
18/12/23, 6:14 am - Jono: Nuh fuck that cunt
18/12/23, 6:14 am - Pero: Discussions about the facts only how it happened this morning #noOpinions
18/12/23, 6:15 am - Dave: Silence and zero judgement until the game
18/12/23, 6:15 am - Gerrard: Lol I know you love facts Mr.flatearth
18/12/23, 6:26 am - Pero: One thing I'm glad not having to worry about the bobby firmino factor
18/12/23, 6:28 am - Dave: God yeah. No more Bobby curse. 

Just sluggish Salah and poonez to worry about
18/12/23, 6:29 am - Gerrard: No Jota is gonna save youse, as it did today sadly. <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 6:29 am - Gerrard: *Jota
18/12/23, 6:40 am - Pero: Whats happened to jota ?
18/12/23, 6:41 am - Gerrard: Recurring calf injury
18/12/23, 6:41 am - Pero: Estimated duration?
18/12/23, 6:41 am - Gerrard: 🤷🏼‍♂️ already been two weeks
18/12/23, 6:42 am - Gerrard: I think Nunez will do ya after all this poonez talk, blame Rodders
18/12/23, 6:43 am - Pero: As he did against newty ? One solid game every 3 months
18/12/23, 6:43 am - Pero: We shall see
18/12/23, 6:44 am - Gerrard: Oh I forgot about that game, so insignificant
18/12/23, 6:44 am - Pero: Not raving on about beating mid table teams ?
18/12/23, 6:45 am - Gerrard: Nail on the head there
18/12/23, 6:45 am - Dave: Saliba’s left nut will pocket poonez
18/12/23, 6:45 am - Gerrard: And then what
18/12/23, 6:45 am - Gerrard: What about VVD
18/12/23, 6:45 am - Liam: Past it
18/12/23, 6:46 am - Gerrard: And Salah?
18/12/23, 6:46 am - Dave: Was more concerned about Salah but he looked like he was on ketamine today
18/12/23, 6:46 am - Gerrard: What about Trent?
18/12/23, 6:46 am - Dave: God, martinelli going to have a fucking field day with that lad

18/12/23, 6:46 am - Gerrard: Then tell what Havertz is gonna do
18/12/23, 6:46 am - Dave: Score, like he did today. And last game. And game before that
18/12/23, 6:46 am - Liam: Liability
18/12/23, 6:47 am - Gerrard: What about Klopp and Arteta?
18/12/23, 6:47 am - Liam: Havertz we score I couple, kids on fire only going to get better
18/12/23, 6:48 am - Pero: Odegaard is starting to look silky again can't wait to see him play
18/12/23, 6:48 am - Dave: Klopp red card, off to the stands. Arteta just set the lawyers on FA, we can afford legal team
18/12/23, 6:48 am - Liam: Oh odegaard was on fire this morning!!
18/12/23, 6:49 am - Liam: Mikel is a boss
18/12/23, 6:49 am - Gerrard: What about Ben White vs Diaz?
18/12/23, 6:50 am - Dave: Benny blanco will be whipping in assists with Diaz in the pocket
18/12/23, 6:53 am - Gerrard: What about Gakpo (baby Firmino)?
18/12/23, 6:54 am - Dave: Insult to Bobby that 🥴
18/12/23, 6:54 am - Gerrard: Baby is an insult?
18/12/23, 6:54 am - Gerrard: You sounding like Jimmity
18/12/23, 6:55 am - Dave: Mission accomplished
18/12/23, 6:58 am - Liam: Huge game now
18/12/23, 6:58 am - Liam: Title contenders going head to head
18/12/23, 6:58 am - Liam: Should be a great game
18/12/23, 6:59 am - Liam: Villa could go top next week lol
18/12/23, 7:02 am - Pero: And let's not forgot as bad and as shambles manure are atm, chle$ea are 6 points behind them
18/12/23, 7:04 am - Gerrard: United and Chelsea in a shambles are right there with previously deemed "title contenders" Newty
18/12/23, 7:05 am - Gerrard: Newty are closer to Chelsea than they are Liverpool and Arsenal.
18/12/23, 7:05 am - Gerrard: 🤷🏼‍♂️ but we aren't supposed to look at the table lads
18/12/23, 7:06 am - Gerrard: Against the rules innit
18/12/23, 7:18 am - Dave: 👀
18/12/23, 7:19 am - Gerrard: I can't remember if Jimmity said they were title contenders or if it was that Lewis guy from Pitchside, always getting them mixed up <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 7:25 am - Gerrard: That's Jimmity right?
18/12/23, 7:27 am - Gerrard: 🤣 the Modric line and the look after 🤣🤣🤣

18/12/23, 3:29 pm - Dave: Porto are a great side
18/12/23, 8:08 pm - James: Klopp last season now it's nunez turn this season
18/12/23, 8:16 pm - James: They lost to sporting last season lol

18/12/23, 8:44 pm - Dave: In the same competition that you were begging not to be a part of? Mickey Mouse cup, no one takes it seriously
18/12/23, 8:44 pm - James: Focus on the league weren't it
18/12/23, 8:47 pm - Gerrard: We got them almost each year and pumped em.
Across the board easy ties.
18/12/23, 8:47 pm - Dave: Is that what you’re doing this season?
18/12/23, 8:48 pm - James: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 8:48 pm - James: 7 points clear then with more points
18/12/23, 8:48 pm - James: How'd it end?
18/12/23, 8:49 pm - James: Arsenal fans never learn
18/12/23, 8:49 pm - Gerrard: Not allowed to look at the table Jimmity, breaking your own rules again
18/12/23, 8:49 pm - James: Perspective for Varsenal fans
18/12/23, 8:50 pm - James: Stfu 😘
18/12/23, 8:50 pm - Gerrard: Rules for some
18/12/23, 8:51 pm - Liam: What’s your angle here jimmity
18/12/23, 8:51 pm - Liam: ?
18/12/23, 8:51 pm - Gerrard: Anti Everyone I think
18/12/23, 8:52 pm - James: Just want to reinforce the point neither of your teams will win the league
18/12/23, 8:52 pm - Dave: Swinging hard
18/12/23, 8:52 pm - James: Next week isn't a title decider
18/12/23, 8:52 pm - Dave: Could be. Unless you’ve got a crystal ball
18/12/23, 8:53 pm - James: Jose said you won't win. Specifically Arsenal
18/12/23, 8:53 pm - Dave: Hell, Newcastle could still win the league at this stage of the campaign
18/12/23, 8:53 pm - Dave: Cause Jose doesn’t hate Arsenal or Wenger whatsoever
18/12/23, 8:53 pm - Gerrard: Jimmity upset that Newty fell off already
18/12/23, 8:54 pm - James: Everybody does
18/12/23, 8:54 pm - Liam: Ya we realise that, it’s Christmas jimmity
18/12/23, 8:55 pm - Liam: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 8:55 pm - James: You learned this from last season? 😳
18/12/23, 8:55 pm - Dave: Always knew this. We’re Arsenal. Too much PTSD to not know <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 8:57 pm - Dave: So what’s Newcastles plan the remainder of this season? What’s the goal? 

Other than pay journos to write articles comparing your youth squad to Jude Bellingham
18/12/23, 8:58 pm - James: I'm not Eddie Howe I don't know. But I trust him ❤️
18/12/23, 8:58 pm - James: Good player that Miley
18/12/23, 8:58 pm - Liam: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 9:00 pm - Dave: Nothing guaranteed
18/12/23, 9:00 pm - James: Except that you won't win it
18/12/23, 9:01 pm - James: Can guarantee that
18/12/23, 9:01 pm - Dave: Why so toxic, don’t you want an English team to win it
18/12/23, 9:01 pm - Dave: I’d be cheering on Newty if we got knocked out
18/12/23, 9:03 pm - James: Where'd I say I didn't want you to do well
18/12/23, 9:05 pm - Dave: So do you want us to win it?
18/12/23, 9:09 pm - James: Doesn't matter what I want
18/12/23, 9:16 pm - Liam: is that why you are all pissy this morning jimmity? Because of the CL draw <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 9:16 pm - James: Nah, I thought we are just chatting?
18/12/23, 9:17 pm - Liam: That’s a better tone.
18/12/23, 10:08 pm - Dave: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 10:09 pm - Dave: Going to be a warzone after all this pisstaking. Hope Mikel has those speakers blaring all week
18/12/23, 10:15 pm - James: Just win the toss at the start and kick toward the kop second half. They get really wound up when teams do that
18/12/23, 11:05 pm - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 11:10 pm - James: Most cleansheets too
18/12/23, 11:10 pm - Gerrard: Chelsea with Jackson
Liverpool with Nunez
Newty with Wilson
Guys just not getting it done up top
18/12/23, 11:12 pm - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 11:12 pm - James: Not too bad. 36 goals from 38
18/12/23, 11:12 pm - James: Alphabetically
18/12/23, 11:12 pm - James: Who else has 7
18/12/23, 11:12 pm - Gerrard: Liverpool better, 36 from 37
18/12/23, 11:12 pm - Gerrard: Oh did you mean to say JOINT most cleansheets?
18/12/23, 11:13 pm - James: What I said was factually correct
18/12/23, 11:13 pm - James: What's Arsenal?
18/12/23, 11:15 pm - Gerrard: No it wasn't
18/12/23, 11:15 pm - Gerrard: If you said Newty and Arsenal have the most clean sheets
18/12/23, 11:15 pm - James: What's Arsenal
18/12/23, 11:16 pm - Dave: Does this mean Newty are top of the table?
18/12/23, 11:16 pm - James: Must be that £100s of millions you spent on that forward line
18/12/23, 11:16 pm - James: How many has nunez got
18/12/23, 11:17 pm - Dave: Goal machine innit
18/12/23, 11:18 pm - James: Amazing the free ride he gets from the bin dippers
18/12/23, 11:18 pm - James: Imagine he played for manure
18/12/23, 11:19 pm - Dave: He has to be the most inefficient striker that’s ever stepped foot on a pitch in prem history
18/12/23, 11:19 pm - James: Wilson 6 starts 7 goals...
Isak 10 starts 7 goals...
18/12/23, 11:20 pm - James: Gordon has more goals from the wing
18/12/23, 11:20 pm - James: 15 starts 6 goals, 4 assists
18/12/23, 11:21 pm - Dave: He’s missed 35 big chances since joining Liverpool
18/12/23, 11:21 pm - James: This is some Francis Jeffers stats
18/12/23, 11:21 pm - James: Eddie Nketsomy is better than nunez
18/12/23, 11:23 pm - James: Mctominay has more goals than nunez
18/12/23, 11:23 pm - Dave: Eddie is yeah. And I think he’s our weak link
18/12/23, 11:23 pm - James: Jez going on about strikers. Jackson has 7 as well
18/12/23, 11:23 pm - James: Nunez is the worst
18/12/23, 11:24 pm - Dave: Oh 100%. When is enough enough?
18/12/23, 11:24 pm - James: You won't win titles with him. But Varpool will with nunez???
18/12/23, 11:25 pm - Dave: Such a double standard for Arsenal. Everyone going on about Havertz being the worst signing ever yet he’s turned it around in less than 3 months of playing for Arsenal. Settled right in now and having blinders week in week out. Nunez is 1.5 seasons in and still can’t hit a barn door
18/12/23, 11:25 pm - Dave: “Get behind the kid, he’ll come good”
18/12/23, 11:25 pm - Dave: No
18/12/23, 11:25 pm - James: Nunez is 25 next year too 😂
18/12/23, 11:25 pm - Dave: Bench the cunt, he’s useless
18/12/23, 11:26 pm - James: 'kid'
18/12/23, 11:26 pm - Dave: Jesse lingard all over again isn’t it
18/12/23, 11:27 pm - James: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 11:27 pm - Dave: Can’t believe Liverpool just had to mail an extra 8.5m to benfica for Nunez because he’s made 60 appearances now 😂😂😂
18/12/23, 11:27 pm - James: He has the same strike rate as Shola Ameobi 😂😂😂
18/12/23, 11:27 pm - Dave: Talk about rubbing salt in the wounds
18/12/23, 11:27 pm - James: And Ameobi was free
18/12/23, 11:27 pm - James: And awful
18/12/23, 11:28 pm - James: What!?
18/12/23, 11:28 pm - James: Dunno what's worse, that or when Mike Ashley 'made the cunts pay the £35m for Carroll upfront'
18/12/23, 11:28 pm - Dave: Yeah lol, doubling down
18/12/23, 11:29 pm - Dave: Would have offloaded him to the Saudis by this point if I was FSG
18/12/23, 11:31 pm - James: Ameobi only ever missed 14 big chances in 298 games
18/12/23, 11:31 pm - James: Nunez has 35 missed in 43 games 😂
18/12/23, 11:33 pm - James: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 11:39 pm - Dave: Got to go. Klopp needs to get tough with him. The bloke is more fussed about squaring up to pep after matches than improving his ability
18/12/23, 11:40 pm - Dave: Watch him score a hat trick against us on Saturday now
18/12/23, 11:44 pm - Dave: https://youtu.be/Ci5Np1-VZzM?si=iMJzzsuKoreV4YHv
18/12/23, 11:52 pm - Pero: I can understand if someone wanted to pay 75M for the sole purpose of squaring up to pep
18/12/23, 11:53 pm - Pero: We play livo 3 times in the next 6 weeks !
19/12/23, 12:48 am - Dave: 🤮
19/12/23, 1:56 am - James: https://x.com/talkSPORT/status/1736730946223697983?s=08
19/12/23, 5:08 am - James: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 5:14 am - Dave: Having a great season to be fair
19/12/23, 5:14 am - Dave: Match fit
19/12/23, 5:15 am - James: Varpool fans were laughing at that one
19/12/23, 5:15 am - James: When he went to Bournemouth
19/12/23, 5:15 am - Dave: Wouldn’t be opposed to it
19/12/23, 5:15 am - James: Look how good he's been for years. Howe was right
19/12/23, 5:15 am - Gerrard: Jimmity telling people how they feel and think again
19/12/23, 5:15 am - James: Better than Nuni?
19/12/23, 5:16 am - James: Was openly being mocked by Varpool fans?
19/12/23, 5:16 am - James: Denying the past again Jezzy?
19/12/23, 5:16 am - James: Typical varpool
19/12/23, 5:16 am - Gerrard: He's been on a tear after rejoining the group after his sulking exit
19/12/23, 5:16 am - Dave: Clearly, look at solankes stats. And solanke doesn’t have the best winger in the world feeding him multiple sitters every game
19/12/23, 5:17 am - Gerrard: I say bring Danny Ings back
19/12/23, 5:17 am - Gerrard: And Adam Lallana
19/12/23, 5:19 am - James: Think Andy Carroll even now would score more than noncy?
19/12/23, 5:19 am - James: At least he has a physical presence
19/12/23, 5:20 am - Dave: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8HjhKnL/
19/12/23, 5:21 am - Gerrard: Wouldn't want anyone tainted by Newty
19/12/23, 5:21 am - Dave: These are the taps ins Eddie fucks for us. Always overcomplicates. Could be what we need. Getting fed tap ins by odegaard, martinelli and saka
19/12/23, 5:22 am - Gerrard: Just so everyone knows, James thinks he's still getting to a few of us when his posts.
I told him that I'll entertain it as a Christmas gift to him.
19/12/23, 5:22 am - Dave: Irrelevant and inflammatory. We’re talking about present
19/12/23, 5:23 am - Dave: Lives rent free in my head when he posts about Arsenal, can’t sleep at night
19/12/23, 5:23 am - James: Would you have Nooni over Eddie?
19/12/23, 5:23 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 5:23 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 5:24 am - James: Like all Varsenal fans and that 1-0...
19/12/23, 5:24 am - James: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 5:25 am - Dave: Yes. Although Eddie is slightly statistically better. I think arteta would just have Nunez on as an assist machine/distraction. He’s fast and strong, would keep defenders busy and give martinelli, saka and odegaard space to bang them in
19/12/23, 5:25 am - James: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 5:26 am - Dave: You asked me whether I’d have him over Eddie. I’m not saying I want him. I just think he’d be more useful for us than Eddie is

19/12/23, 6:50 am - James: Lads
19/12/23, 6:51 am - Dave: Down arsenal pub in long beach
19/12/23, 6:51 am - Dave: Well
19/12/23, 6:51 am - Dave: A mate of mine I’m watching it with is a die hard Liverpool fan. So will probably be a tussle over whether we go to the Liverpool pub in long beach or the Arsenal pub
19/12/23, 6:53 am - Gerrard: Wonker
*In a country accent
19/12/23, 6:53 am - Gerrard: *Liam's accent
19/12/23, 6:54 am - James: Groooosss
19/12/23, 6:54 am - Dave: Arsenal pub has better food. They’re both ironically Irish pubs by day
19/12/23, 6:55 am - James: Watch your wallet
19/12/23, 6:55 am - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/shorts/FKnte2kifRU?si=s9-zP86fMH5d0n73
19/12/23, 6:57 am - James: Less scousers stealing your chips and drinking your gravy
19/12/23, 6:59 am - Dave: I got a parasite at the liverpool pub the one and only time I ate there
19/12/23, 6:59 am - James: Klippy deffo losing his hair in this gif. When was this? Haven't seen him without a cap on for two years now
19/12/23, 6:59 am - Dave: No joke <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 6:59 am - James: Eyes, teeth and hair next?

19/12/23, 7:00 am - Dave: Teeth will be there until we go extinct as a species
19/12/23, 7:00 am - James: When he said 'book the hotel' for the CL final they didn't get to (because they got whipped by real) did he cancel his turkey hair transplant
19/12/23, 7:02 am - Gerrard: You both shaming Klopp when you've both had nose jobs 
Shame on youse
19/12/23, 7:02 am - James: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 7:19 am - Dave: You think I’ve had a nose job??? You seen the state of it 🤣 Wouldn’t surprise me if Adam Scott had his done
19/12/23, 7:20 am - Dave: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 7:20 am - Gerrard: I thought you had it "broken" then "fixed" but it was a surgery horrors kinda deal <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 7:23 am - James: I didn't?
19/12/23, 7:23 am - James: Excellent that
19/12/23, 7:23 am - James: Wow
19/12/23, 7:24 am - James: Jesus Jez
19/12/23, 7:25 am - Dave: Wow, personal low blows coming out. Knife to the gut
19/12/23, 7:25 am - James: I had cancer and you're mocking it and you're also saying Rodwell is an ugly cunt
19/12/23, 7:25 am - Dave: Probably won’t go outside for a week now
19/12/23, 7:26 am - James: @14244893404 he actually said to me in person the other day, to my face, he was upset I wasn't disfigured from it
19/12/23, 7:26 am - Gerrard: Wow, you've joked about this before
19/12/23, 7:26 am - James: One of the last things he said as we crossed the street and I said see you in a month mate have a great Christmas
19/12/23, 7:26 am - Gerrard: So sensitive now Jimmity is back
19/12/23, 7:26 am - Dave: Pretty sure he said he to me he was disappointed it “didn’t finish the job it started”
19/12/23, 7:27 am - Gerrard: Only truth I've heard from Jimmity
19/12/23, 7:27 am - James: I sat there listening to his life troubles
19/12/23, 7:27 am - Gerrard: Dick nose would be a great nickname
19/12/23, 7:27 am - James: And he does me like that
19/12/23, 7:27 am - Gerrard: This is equality
19/12/23, 7:29 am - James: There is no line with him @14244893404
19/12/23, 7:31 am - Dave: Can see that
19/12/23, 8:12 am - Gerrard: I wish there was that line on you
19/12/23, 8:59 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 can we still be mates if I visit but I've given up drinking?
19/12/23, 9:00 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 9:00 am - Dave: Of course. Why wouldn’t we?
19/12/23, 9:01 am - Gerrard: You know.... because of how close you are to it
19/12/23, 9:06 am - Dave: I’d be more concerned about how you’ll survive without your mushrooms for a few days, don’t want you having any mental breakdowns
19/12/23, 9:06 am - Dave: Make sure you’ve got health insurance otherwise you’ll be joining your mate on the corner of George and market
19/12/23, 9:06 am - Gerrard: More breakdowns on drugs this last month
19/12/23, 9:06 am - Gerrard: Gonna take a rest
19/12/23, 9:07 am - Dave: Oh really, didn’t realise. Shouldn’t have joked, sorry
19/12/23, 9:07 am - Gerrard: Lol all good, they're positive
19/12/23, 9:07 am - Dave: Good breakdowns?
19/12/23, 9:07 am - Gerrard: Nice little indicator to work on some stuff
19/12/23, 9:07 am - Gerrard: Worse comedown I can remember at that festival.
19/12/23, 9:08 am - Gerrard: Worst
19/12/23, 9:08 am - Gerrard: I think there's been another but can't recall it
19/12/23, 9:10 am - James: Finally 🙏

19/12/23, 9:10 am - Gerrard: A stranger asked if I was ok just from looking at me

19/12/23, 9:12 am - Dave: <Media omitted>

19/12/23, 8:58 pm - James: Helped them finish top 4
19/12/23, 9:03 pm - James: Cacido one minute in should have been a straight red
19/12/23, 9:03 pm - James: No var lucky for him
19/12/23, 11:11 pm - James: https://x.com/Memecastle_Utd/status/1737233990744940837?s=08
19/12/23, 11:13 pm - Jono: There goes the treble
19/12/23, 11:13 pm - Jono: Is Trippier the new TAA?
19/12/23, 11:22 pm - Gerrard: Oh shit, last I saw it was 1-0 Newty, what happened?
19/12/23, 11:23 pm - Gerrard: Is he stepping up into Mids and winning games for them?
19/12/23, 11:24 pm - James: Was going to say put him in the engine room
19/12/23, 11:25 pm - Gerrard: Too old for that
19/12/23, 11:25 pm - James: Don't remember a player ever coming on and costing a game quite like that. Sensational really
19/12/23, 11:26 pm - Gerrard: Trips?
19/12/23, 11:40 pm - Dave: Did you just lose to Chelsea lol @61452662705
19/12/23, 11:53 pm - Liam: Trips needs to retire
20/12/23, 12:06 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 12:09 am - Gerrard: And Chelsea gifted Newty a goal 😱
20/12/23, 12:12 am - Gerrard: Look at BrunoG celebrating his penalty in a penalty shootout loss 🤣
20/12/23, 12:13 am - Gerrard: Trippsey is DONE
20/12/23, 12:14 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 Cole Palmer has such a better potential talent than Flash in the pan Gordon eh
20/12/23, 12:15 am - James: <Media omitted>

@61452662705 for Trippsey
20/12/23, 12:19 am - James: Not been the same since he left the England camp for personal reasons
20/12/23, 12:20 am - James: You have Salah's v Bournemouth away?
20/12/23, 12:20 am - James: That landed yet?
20/12/23, 12:20 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 let's leave Trippsey alone, he's tired from playing too much football
20/12/23, 12:20 am - James: Nah it's not fatigue
20/12/23, 12:21 am - James: Not a good look having Ritchie take a pen in 2023. A player we signed to help us out the championship in 2017
20/12/23, 12:29 am - Pero: Far out trippsy 🤦‍♂️
20/12/23, 12:30 am - Pero: How come almiron or some other attacker didn't take a pen
20/12/23, 12:32 am - Gerrard: Puzzling
20/12/23, 12:32 am - Gerrard: Someone who can shoot <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 12:44 am - Pero: Fulham and Everton in good shoot-out. Pickers just can't hold the ball out, he picked the correct side on at least 3 pens but arm not long enough to do the job
20/12/23, 12:45 am - Jono: Pickford sucks too much cock
20/12/23, 12:45 am - Jono: Needs to focus on the ball
20/12/23, 12:46 am - Gerrard: Pickford would help Newty
20/12/23, 12:50 am - Pero: The pen he did save he was way off his line how did they allow that to not be retaken
20/12/23, 12:53 am - James: No var and terrible linesman
20/12/23, 12:54 am - Gerrard: And Trippsey is a terrible defender
20/12/23, 12:55 am - James: Outstanding right back who is having an absolute mare these last few weeks. Both can be true
20/12/23, 1:09 am - Dave: https://x.com/nocontextfm1/status/1737237069947359601?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
20/12/23, 1:09 am - Dave: Hate that cunt
20/12/23, 1:09 am - Dave: Is that Jude Bellingham?
20/12/23, 1:10 am - James: Didn't see Jude Bellingham running the show in the prem and CL at 17 so nahhhh
20/12/23, 1:10 am - Dave: Blokes in his mid 30s and relies on pace, was bound to happen at some point
20/12/23, 1:11 am - James: He's never had pace. You casual
20/12/23, 1:11 am - James: STILL salty 43 days later...
20/12/23, 1:14 am - Dave: 🪇
20/12/23, 1:14 am - Dave: Everyone hates him. He trends after every game he’s so unlikeable
20/12/23, 1:16 am - James: By arsenal fans
20/12/23, 1:16 am - James: That's all that happens on social media. Arsenal fans pipe up if we lose. Absolute weirdos
20/12/23, 1:17 am - Dave: Your team is the one that’s fighting the opposing players at the end of every game you get dicked
20/12/23, 1:18 am - James: Celebrating Chelsea winning today
20/12/23, 1:18 am - James: London's biggest club
20/12/23, 1:18 am - James: Yours is the one who can't take an L and have their manager and fans cry and then board release statements 😂
20/12/23, 1:19 am - James: God it will be funny if one of you lose this weekend
20/12/23, 1:20 am - James: Might be a tsunami of tears on Merseyside

20/12/23, 3:27 am - Gerrard: I was wondering what he thought
20/12/23, 3:29 am - James: Why is this even brought up
20/12/23, 3:30 am - James: What has that Varpool team got in common with that treble winning team
20/12/23, 3:30 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 3:30 am - James: Get these scousers off the telly
20/12/23, 3:31 am - James: @14244893404 Varpool are like the Connor McGregor of football
20/12/23, 3:32 am - Gerrard: Nothing in common
20/12/23, 3:32 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 3:32 am - James: All talk after beating shite opponents having an off day and then never defended their title
20/12/23, 3:32 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 3:32 am - Gerrard: 20pts difference on those schmucks
20/12/23, 3:33 am - James: They won a legitimate CL and PL and FA Cup
20/12/23, 3:33 am - James: And defended their titles for years
20/12/23, 3:36 am - James: This is an article written recently about a segment in 2020 😂😂😂
20/12/23, 3:38 am - Gerrard: The British media needs something to post, they had to bin all their ETH sack articles after we didnt do em
20/12/23, 7:15 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/28KPoltTpY0?si=NrA71INc3bQNjWqs

20/12/23, 7:22 am - Dave: Absolute weapon
20/12/23, 7:22 am - Jono: Another Brazilian cunt
20/12/23, 7:22 am - Jono: Good player tho
20/12/23, 7:31 am - Jono: Pumped to see the fat American who looks like a Beach Boy running around Wembley holding up the Monster Energy Cup
20/12/23, 7:32 am - James: Excellent management. He said he wanted to and Howe said yes. Would have been a terrible look to deny your vice captain in front of the team
20/12/23, 7:32 am - James: Bohley?
20/12/23, 7:32 am - James: Only cost them £1b
20/12/23, 7:33 am - Gerrard: ....but he missed by a mile
20/12/23, 7:34 am - Jono: The Chelsea calamity at the back almost made Trippier look innocent of all crimes
20/12/23, 7:35 am - Gerrard: You could see his eyes at full time, was always gonna miss
20/12/23, 7:39 am - James: Penalties are a cruel mistress
20/12/23, 7:39 am - James: You win some, you lose more
20/12/23, 7:39 am - James: Like gambling
20/12/23, 7:48 am - Dave: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:48 am - Dave: Tripps just wants to focus on the league innit

21/12/23, 5:19 am - Dave: I’ve got to watch it at the fucking liverpool pub on Saturday 🤮
21/12/23, 5:52 am - Gerrard: You'll be singing YNWA like Liam did
21/12/23, 6:10 am - Dave: Never. I’ll be leaving there with a couple of teeth missing if we win
21/12/23, 8:00 am - Gerrard: You'll have a full English set then
21/12/23, 9:43 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/sK8vl9UhfFg?si=LwipQJC7osFIgqRp
21/12/23, 10:09 am - Dave: Howe will be gone end of the season and in will come the exotic name.

Cue the “Newcastle United can confirm that Eddie Howe has left his position as head coach by mutual consent.”
21/12/23, 10:10 am - Gerrard: "It was clear that I was no longer the manager to take Newty forward"
21/12/23, 10:14 am - Dave: “He leaves the Magpies after more than two years in charge, having steered the club to 4th and 14th place finishes in the Premier League and reaching the final of a Carabao Cup during his tenure”
21/12/23, 10:15 am - Gerrard: "instilling a sense of pride in the fanbase before it later turned toxic and they called for his resignation"
21/12/23, 10:16 am - Pero: "Called for his head as they would say in saudi"
21/12/23, 10:17 am - Gerrard: "one fan even tried to crash an aeroplane into St James Park, as is their way in Saudi Arabia"

21/12/23, 10:54 am - Gerrard: You mean it's a reality?
21/12/23, 10:55 am - Jono: Usually when Klopp expresses an open desire for a specific player the perfect storm happens
1) we express interest to the club
2) the club inflates the price knowing he’s our prime target
3) FSG buckle
21/12/23, 10:58 am - Jono: <Media omitted>

22/12/23, 4:58 am - Dave: That’s wild @61409710717. Considering we have the best defence in the league - 33% of our goals conceded came from errors 😂
22/12/23, 4:59 am - Dave: You realise how shit we were then as well

22/12/23, 11:28 pm - James: And while being crowned the best club in the world
23/12/23, 1:35 am - Dave: The stench of John smiths and beef and kidney pie in the studio
23/12/23, 1:42 am - Jono: What would @61409710717 prefer…
1) being in the same room as those 2 
2) getting fucked by a horse
23/12/23, 1:42 am - Gerrard: Obviously the room dude
23/12/23, 1:42 am - Gerrard: What's wrong with you
23/12/23, 1:43 am - Gerrard: I'd get to call Ange a cunt to his face <This message was edited>
23/12/23, 1:43 am - Jono: You’d chicken out
23/12/23, 1:43 am - Gerrard: Then have his mate knock me out
23/12/23, 1:43 am - Jono: Score predictions tomorrow?

2-all
23/12/23, 1:44 am - Gerrard: My prediction is you blowing everything out of proportion
23/12/23, 1:44 am - Jono: 🫶🏽
23/12/23, 1:45 am - Jono: Why don’t you save that negative energy for when I see you later today
23/12/23, 1:46 am - Gerrard: Jimmity said negative energy is only for the group chat and we have to act like he's not a cunt when we meet in real life.
23/12/23, 1:46 am - Jono changed the group name from "Weekly Refereeing Group Chat" to "Negative energy only Group Chat"
23/12/23, 1:46 am - Dave: @61409710717 be like “this a punishment?”
23/12/23, 1:47 am - Dave: 2-1 Arsenal 👀
23/12/23, 1:50 am - Gerrard: Jimmity quits the group when we're nice to each other
23/12/23, 1:59 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/p/C1K2B99uO3-/?igsh=ZzA1NHFzN3I0M21p
23/12/23, 3:24 am - Liam: Anfield, Liverpool should win if they got anything about them
23/12/23, 4:31 am - Dave: At Anfield. Surprised we’re not 4/5 to 1
23/12/23, 4:32 am - Gerrard: That Nunez Effect
23/12/23, 4:58 am - James: Haha not going to happen
23/12/23, 5:17 am - Dave: @61409710717 @61404060785 may the best team win tomorrow kind gentlemen 🤝
23/12/23, 6:05 am - James: Scared
23/12/23, 6:12 am - James: Scared
23/12/23, 7:59 am - Jono: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 10:03 am - Shaun: Man, I just had a dream I saw the Chan Clan
23/12/23, 10:30 am - James: Yeah don't let Jez near kids. Why he left Coogee, too many schools
23/12/23, 11:48 am - James: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 11:59 am - Jono: Don’t know what’s more shocking…
That stat or Gerrard looking like a child sex offender
23/12/23, 12:02 pm - James: Which Gerard
23/12/23, 12:02 pm - Jono: Haha unintended linkage 😅
23/12/23, 12:06 pm - Pero: He looks like a legit predator
23/12/23, 12:08 pm - Pero: Best of luck tomorrow lads should be decent football match.  Feels like a grand final
23/12/23, 12:09 pm - Pero: See ya at 8am gez
23/12/23, 1:11 pm - James: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 1:18 pm - Gerrard: Hey your kid can't open a KitKat wrapper
23/12/23, 1:19 pm - Gerrard: Not helping again
23/12/23, 1:48 pm - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 3:24 pm - Gerrard: LOL to United
23/12/23, 3:25 pm - Gerrard: The team that hasn't been mentioned in 80 years when people talk about winning anything.
- Newtle
23/12/23, 4:29 pm - Dave: Luton all over Newtie, ouch
23/12/23, 4:31 pm - Dave: How ten hag is clinging on is the eighth wonder of the world
23/12/23, 6:22 pm - Jono: Relevant
23/12/23, 7:34 pm - Jono: https://x.com/eplbible/status/1738619361814856053?s=48

Ludicrous decision
23/12/23, 7:57 pm - Dave: Very lucky for us
23/12/23, 10:02 pm - James: Fell asleep. Saw the first half. Dreadful defending from zinchenco or whatever for Salah goal
23/12/23, 10:03 pm - Jono: That Trent miss when we had a 4 on 1 will forever haunt me
23/12/23, 10:12 pm - James: Nunez-esq miss but the assist earlier was good
23/12/23, 10:12 pm - James: I thought Gabriel was offside
23/12/23, 10:23 pm - Jono: Nuh he was on
23/12/23, 11:40 pm - Dave: Behave. Knee was clearly keeping him on
23/12/23, 11:40 pm - Dave: Yeah that was rough
23/12/23, 11:41 pm - Jono: Great game but all that proved to me is city will probably still win the thing
23/12/23, 11:43 pm - Jono: Arsenal didn’t show me what I had assumed was a resilience they haven’t had in years to compliment their depth. They had an opportunity to go full throttle mid way through the 2nd half when LFC looked out of gas
23/12/23, 11:43 pm - Jono: And they didn’t take the chance and started making some shocker errors playing out
23/12/23, 11:44 pm - Jono: LFC proved they don’t have the squad to go all the way. We need to make moves in Jan otherwise we’re 3rd at best
23/12/23, 11:45 pm - Chris: Geez, you're really taking this group name to heart huh.
23/12/23, 11:45 pm - Jono: Either one of these teams could’ve gone 3 games clear of City by today
23/12/23, 11:46 pm - Jono: Missed opportunity is all I’m saying
23/12/23, 11:46 pm - Jono: Facts
24/12/23, 12:39 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 @61410933997 @61478754484 good game lads
24/12/23, 12:39 am - Gerrard: Salah too late on his passing today, killed chances
24/12/23, 12:40 am - Gerrard: But great goal though sooooooo
24/12/23, 12:40 am - Gerrard: Handball pen?
24/12/23, 12:40 am - Gerrard: Blame Salah
24/12/23, 12:41 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 👋🏻 Hi!
24/12/23, 12:49 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 @61404060785 was it just me or was Liverpool's defence really good over the game apart from that freekick.
24/12/23, 12:49 am - Jono: Yeah Konate made up for his poor marking for the goal
24/12/23, 12:50 am - Jono: Gomez was great too
24/12/23, 12:51 am - Gerrard: Muted Saka and Martinelli
24/12/23, 12:52 am - Gerrard: Gakpo for Nunez was the mistake by Klopp
24/12/23, 12:52 am - Gerrard: Thought Gakpo was great and we should longballed to him
24/12/23, 12:53 am - Jono: Gapko looked gassed and Nunez was alright. Made a few chances out of nothing and didn’t lose cheap/early ball
24/12/23, 12:53 am - Jono: Gapko was great though hence being gassed late on
24/12/23, 12:54 am - Gerrard: Saka should send Kostas a sorry Instagram story
24/12/23, 12:55 am - Jono: Martinelli does a lot without doing much
24/12/23, 12:55 am - Anthony: Could only watch 20ish mins 👴🏻. Xmas season is exhausting these days lol
24/12/23, 12:55 am - Anthony: Merry Christmas lads !
24/12/23, 12:58 am - Jono: Merry Christmas gents 😘🎄
24/12/23, 1:14 am - Dave: 100% a pen
24/12/23, 1:15 am - Dave: https://x.com/patricktimmons1/status/1738646905314324921?s=46&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
24/12/23, 1:23 am - Gerrard: Better than United
24/12/23, 1:28 am - Gerrard: I thought there's a lot of positives out of today, especially Newty losing
24/12/23, 1:34 am - Dave: Still can’t believe newtle lost to Luton
24/12/23, 1:34 am - Dave: They’re heading to the bottom half
24/12/23, 1:36 am - Dave: Long story cut short with Arsenal Liverpool game today. Think a draw was a fair result. Could have gone either way, stats very evenly matched looking at them. 

If I had to pick a side that should have edged it, it would be Liverpool. Was at anfield though and I’m happy with a point. Great goal by Salah
24/12/23, 1:37 am - Dave: Merry Christmas all
24/12/23, 1:39 am - Gerrard: Liverpool 60-40, had better chances to win it
24/12/23, 1:39 am - Gerrard: I've done some research
24/12/23, 1:41 am - Chandra: Zinchenko needs some defensive 101 lessons again
24/12/23, 1:42 am - Gerrard: Yeah we said here that he's the weak link in the squad
24/12/23, 1:42 am - Dave: We beat Luton? What’s he smoking. We’re not Newtle
24/12/23, 1:43 am - Dave: 100%. He was the weak link today
24/12/23, 1:43 am - Chandra: Yeh lot goals conceded recently with opposition targeting him one way or another
24/12/23, 1:44 am - Dave: 15 mins into that game and I said to my Liverpool mate, “if I was Klopp I’d be solely targeting zinny” 😂 nightmare
24/12/23, 1:46 am - Dave: He’s great attacking and creatively. Woeful defensively. Similar to Trent
24/12/23, 1:47 am - Dave: Both looked shite today
24/12/23, 1:48 am - Jono: Damning evidence
24/12/23, 1:49 am - Jono: Or we still blaming it on the injuries
24/12/23, 1:57 am - Dave: https://x.com/therealdonreal/status/1738637329684648316?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
24/12/23, 1:58 am - Gerrard: After Konate's fuckup in the freekick, I thought he was awesome on defence one on ones
24/12/23, 1:58 am - Gerrard: But no one saved him, Salah fucked that one I'm convinced
24/12/23, 1:59 am - Gerrard: I was saying middle play ain't working, lob to Gakpo
24/12/23, 1:59 am - Gerrard: He did nothing there
24/12/23, 1:59 am - Gerrard: We missed
24/12/23, 1:59 am - Gerrard: Too far right if anything
24/12/23, 1:59 am - Dave: He did. He was there
24/12/23, 2:00 am - Gerrard: Is this critique of the rest of the team?
24/12/23, 2:00 am - Dave: He’s everywhere. Total mop across the pitch
24/12/23, 2:00 am - Gerrard: Lol
24/12/23, 2:00 am - Dave: No, a compliment about rice <This message was edited>
24/12/23, 2:01 am - Gerrard: But he didn't do anything.... Stopped it being a 4 on none?
24/12/23, 2:02 am - Dave: Trent should have buried it of course, but he’s not the best midfielder in the world like Liverpool fans suggested
24/12/23, 2:02 am - Gerrard: He should've middle, 50-50 between Salah and the others, bad positioning
24/12/23, 2:42 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/xbzLDi-Qywg?si=37PjyGC14QOOHDpo

🤣🤣🤣 Klopp going for Dermot's head now
24/12/23, 3:19 am - Dave: How dare he question a ref’s decision. What a bitch. Ban him indefinitely
24/12/23, 3:23 am - Gerrard: Lol
24/12/23, 3:24 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/mZuKWVC0JUA?si=Mray7URnLnJr2b2m
24/12/23, 4:25 am - Pero: Merry xmas guys ! 😘
Solid game of football this morning , santa was generous and gave points to everyone
24/12/23, 4:25 am - Pero: Except newty and manure
24/12/23, 4:44 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1NkNJzs_zP/?igsh=MTZuaTM3ZXNxZnppcQ==
24/12/23, 5:08 am - Gerrard: Also low key had a great game.....
24/12/23, 5:23 am - Gerrard: It's cool that both our teams are amazing at the same time, and then there's Jimmity and Newty <This message was edited>
24/12/23, 5:29 am - Gerrard: Well..... I'm not sure about the ruling on that one 🤣
24/12/23, 5:30 am - Gerrard: Good thing he's not a Norwich fan
24/12/23, 5:30 am - Jono: So many great one hit wonders over the years

Ice ice baby
Tainted love
Come on Eileen

newtle footbally club
24/12/23, 5:31 am - Gerrard: I got in trouble because I thought this was the first year ever that Newtle was in the CL
24/12/23, 5:31 am - Gerrard: Who'd have thought they were kinda good at one point in the past
24/12/23, 5:36 am - Dave: 68 years ago?
24/12/23, 5:37 am - Dave: Big game
24/12/23, 5:39 am - Gerrard: Only bad point from today...... <This message was edited>
24/12/23, 5:58 am - Dave: That’s if you really believe either of us have a chance 😔
24/12/23, 9:03 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1FAXYCIDZh/?igsh=bGtxb3dsem1haGh3
24/12/23, 9:27 am - James: Just woke up hi Jez 👋
24/12/23, 9:27 am - James: I told you we'd lose
24/12/23, 9:28 am - James: I put money on it
24/12/23, 9:28 am - James: Merry Christmas 🎄
24/12/23, 9:29 am - James: You don't
24/12/23, 9:30 am - James: Bottled it
24/12/23, 9:31 am - James: Owen still trying to get Varpool fans to like him
24/12/23, 9:34 am - James: We beat them though klippy
24/12/23, 9:35 am - Gerrard: Hi 👋 Jimmity
24/12/23, 9:35 am - Gerrard: Remember when drawing to Luton was inexcusable?
24/12/23, 9:39 am - James: It is. As is losing
24/12/23, 10:08 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 how do you feel about Arsenal and Liverpool being on top of the table and Newty falling apart?
24/12/23, 10:16 am - James: I don't care about your teams
24/12/23, 10:20 am - Gerrard: Breaking News!
Jimmity doesn't care about what happens to Arsenal and Liverpool!
Everyone bookmark this for referencing in the future.
24/12/23, 1:04 pm - Dave: Classic
24/12/23, 1:06 pm - Dave: Wasn’t a foul, very unfortunate. Footballs a contact sport. Hope Tsimikas gets better soon
24/12/23, 1:11 pm - Gerrard: He got too much numbers and not enough shoulder, dog act <This message was edited>
24/12/23, 5:55 pm - Dave: https://onefootball.com/en/news/liverpool-pay-the-price-for-awful-anfield-pitch-against-arsenal-38775299
24/12/23, 10:53 pm - Gerrard: Merry Christmas from the Refs
24/12/23, 10:56 pm - Dave: Shouldn’t have dumped the Atlantic Ocean on the pitch, everyone would have been able to stay on their feet then. Wouldn’t have been a handball controversy and Tsimikas would still have an intact collarbone
24/12/23, 10:57 pm - Gerrard: Wow
24/12/23, 10:57 pm - Gerrard: Butterfly effect
24/12/23, 10:59 pm - Dave: Great game, so tense. Can’t stop thinking about it. We’ve got you on the 7th and then Feb 4th. Mad
24/12/23, 10:59 pm - Dave: Both at emirates thank god, Anfield so stressful
24/12/23, 11:20 pm - Gerrard: Will be great when your lot gets too relaxed at home and the buttfucking begins
25/12/23, 7:27 am - James: After Christmas bottle job incoming
25/12/23, 7:31 am - Dave: Varpool or gunners? Or both?
25/12/23, 7:32 am - James: Both. Why not
25/12/23, 8:20 am - Liam: That’s interesting
25/12/23, 8:29 am - Liam: 📸 Look at this post on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/share/9PkMn1zuux4USpkD/?mibextid=K8Wfd2
25/12/23, 9:34 am - Gerrard: Chelsea and United's seasons would make losing the title to City so bearable
26/12/23, 5:26 am - Dave: If you hadn’t flooded Anfield to stop Arteta ball, odegaard wouldn’t have slipped and there wouldn’t have been any handball claims
26/12/23, 5:27 am - Gerrard: That little kid forgot what game he was playing (evident from his overall game) and tried to pick up the ball
26/12/23, 6:04 am - Pero: Let's not forget Trent going through the back of havertz in the box , seen them given as pens more times then not
26/12/23, 6:24 am - Gerrard: Pero said it wasn't a pen but he'd scream for it anyway
26/12/23, 6:51 am - Pero: There's plenty of pens I think are not pens but are given
26/12/23, 9:46 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/M6ICP7cq4Vo?si=D5q9rJm9d9dqBj2f
26/12/23, 9:47 am - Liam: In my opinion it was a pen
26/12/23, 9:47 am - Liam: But my opinion doesn’t matter thank fuck
26/12/23, 10:00 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/TXTb6FusWlA?si=IfbbfCHKmftgk96H
Why do they bother using AFTV guys for these?
26/12/23, 10:00 am - Gerrard: Embarrassing
26/12/23, 10:41 am - Liam: Aftv ❤️
26/12/23, 4:06 pm - Jono: Kiwi Messi hat-trick for old mate Jimmity
26/12/23, 4:07 pm - Jono: Newtle on life support
26/12/23, 4:12 pm - Jono: The defending for the 3rd goal… oh my dayz.
26/12/23, 4:24 pm - Dave: Honestly lads, just bet against them every week. Forest were paying $11 🤤
26/12/23, 5:53 pm - Dave: World’s tiniest violin for the wealthiest club in the world. He’ll be replaced with an Eduardo Howeini before the end of the season anyway
26/12/23, 6:09 pm - Liam: 🪵
26/12/23, 6:12 pm - Dave: 🥅 ⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️

26/12/23, 8:07 pm - Dave: Burnley looking up for it
26/12/23, 8:08 pm - Jono: That Odobert is quality
26/12/23, 8:08 pm - Dave: Just put it on, making some good runs through on goal in last 5 mins
26/12/23, 8:09 pm - Jono: Liverpool had 8 shots on target first half
26/12/23, 8:09 pm - Jono: Most this season from any team
26/12/23, 8:09 pm - Jono: Their keeper has been immense
26/12/23, 8:09 pm - Dave: Total domination in the first then?
26/12/23, 8:16 pm - Jono: This dweeby looking keeper can fuck right off
26/12/23, 8:18 pm - Jono: JOTA
26/12/23, 8:18 pm - Jono: So good to have him back
26/12/23, 8:18 pm - Jono: Always clinical
26/12/23, 8:18 pm - Dave: Great goal
26/12/23, 8:21 pm - Dave: Burnley can’t hit a barn door lol
26/12/23, 9:08 pm - Gerrard: 😱 wheels = off
26/12/23, 9:10 pm - Gerrard: What a dive by Issac
26/12/23, 9:12 pm - Gerrard: St James is such a hard place to go and get 3pts from 🤨
26/12/23, 9:21 pm - Gerrard: Nunez is better shooting from distance than he is from 3ft
26/12/23, 9:22 pm - Gerrard: Endo > Rice
26/12/23, 9:23 pm - Jono: Onana again 🤣
26/12/23, 9:28 pm - Dave: “It’s a deeeesssgrace”
26/12/23, 9:28 pm - Dave: Villa boom
26/12/23, 9:29 pm - Dave: 2-0. Great goals. United look so dejected. What a boxing day
26/12/23, 9:29 pm - Gerrard: Did you guys see Goldbridge go off yesterday?
26/12/23, 9:30 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/xyYsblnTPgU?si=Ahf9GZACRaUT9J92
26/12/23, 9:31 pm - Gerrard: Thinks sacking ETH will just continue the terrible cycle, so fingers crossed he gets sacked
26/12/23, 9:43 pm - Dave: 💯 it will 😂 owners are the problem. Rotten from top down, love it ❤️
26/12/23, 9:51 pm - Jono: I’m actually embarrassed we didn’t beat these cunts
26/12/23, 10:00 pm - Gerrard: I'm embarrassed that you and I support the same team
26/12/23, 10:06 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/oTBYb4MUgJ8?si=Ip-Tc-2yKmmSdbi6

26/12/23, 10:39 pm - Gerrard: Bruno?
26/12/23, 10:42 pm - Gerrard: United are so much better than Newtle
26/12/23, 10:44 pm - Liam: Oh newy are terrible
26/12/23, 10:45 pm - Liam: Anyone heard from James?
26/12/23, 11:01 pm - Gerrard: Welfare check?
26/12/23, 11:04 pm - Liam: Uniteds squad isn’t as good as newy
26/12/23, 11:04 pm - Liam: Howe is underachieving
27/12/23, 1:34 am - Dave: Had a $5 acca on today and needed Villa to win for 3k return. Classic
27/12/23, 1:35 am - Dave: Done a @61409710717 and checked out for the season. He’ll be back when Eduardo Howetini is their new manager and they drop 500m in the Jan transfer window
27/12/23, 1:40 am - Gerrard: This makes me happy
27/12/23, 1:40 am - Gerrard: Not underachieving, that makes it sound like he's achieving anything at all.
27/12/23, 1:41 am - Dave: Does it make you even happier that I was sticking my nose up at the $420 cash out offer thinking it was a done deal when Villa were 2-0 up and dominant
27/12/23, 1:43 am - Liam: Did you have cash out option?
27/12/23, 1:50 am - Louie: Closet United Fan
27/12/23, 1:51 am - Dave: Yes.. $420
27/12/23, 1:52 am - Liam: How much you put on
27/12/23, 1:52 am - Liam: $5
27/12/23, 1:52 am - Liam: I’ve updated myself
27/12/23, 1:52 am - Liam: That’s very annoying
27/12/23, 1:53 am - Liam: Fucking United
27/12/23, 1:53 am - Dave: I win money betting against newtie every week so I’m not too sad
27/12/23, 1:57 am - Gerrard: Easy money
27/12/23, 1:57 am - Dave: Antony couldn’t look interested if he tried could be 😂 https://x.com/utdera_/status/1739779601717477568?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
27/12/23, 2:01 am - Liam: Basically cheating
27/12/23, 2:11 am - Gerrard: I reckon they'll shutdown betting on a Newtle loss soon, betting companies losing too much money
27/12/23, 2:23 am - Liam: Next 3 games doesn’t look great for newy
27/12/23, 2:38 am - Dave: No money to be made on those games
27/12/23, 2:43 am - Dave: Maybe a multi with Newcastle conceding 4 or more in every match
27/12/23, 3:22 am - Gerrard: Can you bet on how many positions they drop in a month?
27/12/23, 3:23 am - Gerrard: But remember St James Park is a hard place to go and get a result at
27/12/23, 3:24 am - Liam: Wood ❤️
27/12/23, 3:24 am - Gerrard: 3 wood
27/12/23, 3:35 am - Gerrard: Anfield is an easy place to get 3pts
27/12/23, 4:49 am - Liam: HAS ANY HEARD FROM JAMES
27/12/23, 5:09 am - Gerrard: *in Cundy's voice
27/12/23, 5:10 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/FXjcSfbK7I8?si=Mx90wiWHNHlUZHLU
27/12/23, 5:11 am - Gerrard: Maybe he left the chat again
27/12/23, 5:16 am - Pero: It can't be easy coping a hatrick from the guy you got rid of
27/12/23, 6:09 am - Dave: https://sports.yahoo.com/nottingham-forest-demand-ref-rob-184127779.html#:~:text=The%20Telegraph-,Nottingham%20Forest%20demand%20ref%20Rob%20Jones%20is%20banned,matches%20after%20Willy%20Boly%20farce&text=Nottingham%20Forest%20have%20written%20to,3%2D2%20defeat%20against%20Bournemouth.
27/12/23, 6:10 am - Dave: It’s a deeeeesssgrace
27/12/23, 6:36 am - Gerrard: Saudis did their best to help Newtle but no luck this time
27/12/23, 7:59 am - Jono: Muy interesante
27/12/23, 8:02 am - Dave: It’s clear then. Nunez is better than Saka, simples
27/12/23, 8:41 am - Jono: Stats don’t lie eh 🤭
27/12/23, 9:35 am - James: Haven't read a single message but can sense a lot of negativity and toxicity in here and it's supposed to be Christmas
27/12/23, 9:35 am - James: You should all take a long hard look at yourselves
27/12/23, 10:15 am - James: Imagine selling a player that didn't do that much for you and then he comes back and scores a hat trick 😂
27/12/23, 10:16 am - James: Don't know what they'll do. He might be in a big trouble by the end of Jan though
27/12/23, 10:17 am - James: I'll never do a Jez
27/12/23, 10:43 pm - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0_t8jKu5gz/?igsh=MWMxbXo1aWI4d3kxZA==
27/12/23, 10:44 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 sorry no one thought to put Newtle into it
27/12/23, 11:13 pm - Gerrard: @61422023136 fucking Everton
27/12/23, 11:20 pm - James: What's it matter. You guys still think you have a chance of winning the league? 😂😂😂
27/12/23, 11:32 pm - Gerrard: Are we still listening to people who support teams that will finish in the bottom half?
27/12/23, 11:38 pm - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 11:46 pm - Dave: Oil money rules the world
27/12/23, 11:48 pm - James: Jezzy is very loud these days. Typical varpool supporter
27/12/23, 11:48 pm - James: It's not faaaair
27/12/23, 11:49 pm - James: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 11:49 pm - Dave: Do you think Liverpool will win it? Keep grinding out the results..
27/12/23, 11:51 pm - James: No, Citeh will win it at a canter second half of the season. Varpool and Varsenal will come second and third. Dunno who comes what but both second and third isn't good enough for both teams when looking at how much money spent
27/12/23, 11:52 pm - James: Pep is right. If varpoolsenal don't win the league they get away with no criticism
27/12/23, 11:54 pm - Dave: What about Varcastles excuse?
27/12/23, 11:54 pm - Gerrard: Arsenal are right there next to Livo, one of us will - def not Newtle
27/12/23, 11:54 pm - Dave: If varcastle don’t get top half
27/12/23, 11:54 pm - Dave: Thought varcastle were a top 4 team now
27/12/23, 11:55 pm - Dave: Seems like they’re going backwards to be honest
27/12/23, 11:55 pm - James: Newcastle will be fine
27/12/23, 11:55 pm - Gerrard: I think Jimmity has lost all credibility over these last few weeks
27/12/23, 11:55 pm - Dave: Oil money got to their head. Buying overpriced gambling addicts and shit cunts with anger issues assaulting lads on the pitch
27/12/23, 11:55 pm - James: Newcastle are years behind on investment. Probably 20 years behind
27/12/23, 11:56 pm - James: And the gap was bridged quickly in 12 months because of Sir Edward Howe
27/12/23, 11:56 pm - Dave: You’ve spent hundreds of millions mate, how much time do you need
27/12/23, 11:56 pm - James: Spent nothing for twenty years pal
27/12/23, 11:56 pm - Dave: Did City take 20 years after the oil money takeover to win anything?
27/12/23, 11:57 pm - Gerrard: Lol acting like some poor team, what an underdog story
27/12/23, 11:57 pm - James: They took 3 years to get CL
27/12/23, 11:57 pm - Dave: Cause they sure as shit were worse off than you when they got taken over
27/12/23, 11:57 pm - James: And had a better team than Newcastle
27/12/23, 11:57 pm - James: Haha
27/12/23, 11:57 pm - Dave: So you want 20 years until we start giving you shit?
27/12/23, 11:57 pm - Gerrard: Zero credibility
27/12/23, 11:57 pm - Dave: Or 3 years?
27/12/23, 11:57 pm - Dave: What’s acceptable?
27/12/23, 11:57 pm - James: Em-barrasing Rodders
27/12/23, 11:57 pm - James: Citeh were under that Thai fella with a very good team
27/12/23, 11:58 pm - James: And were top 10
27/12/23, 11:58 pm - Gerrard: Is it time for me to go full Stalin and boot this bottom half supporter from this Title Challengers group chat?
27/12/23, 11:58 pm - James: Cryteta took three years to get you 8th to 4th
27/12/23, 11:58 pm - James: Sir Eddie took one year 19th to 4th
27/12/23, 11:58 pm - Dave: So you need 20 years of hundreds of millions a year before we can start expecting results?
27/12/23, 11:58 pm - Gerrard changed the group name from "Negative energy only Group Chat" to "Title Challengers Group Chat + Jimmity"
27/12/23, 11:59 pm - Dave: 8th - 5th - 2nd
27/12/23, 11:59 pm - Dave: First year doesn’t count, he joined halfway through season
27/12/23, 11:59 pm - James: Two 8th finishes wasn't it
27/12/23, 11:59 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 he doesn't realise everyone else took that season off
27/12/23, 11:59 pm - James: Oh OK then 😂😂😂
27/12/23, 11:59 pm - Gerrard: #progress
28/12/23, 12:00 am - Dave: Well how can you judge someone’s first season who joined halfway through the season
28/12/23, 12:00 am - James: Cryteta might finish 3rd this season...
28/12/23, 12:01 am - Gerrard: Klopp finished 8th too
28/12/23, 12:01 am - James: So you can't judge Sir Eddie?
28/12/23, 12:01 am - Dave: Still progress. Liverpool have been fantastic this season. Fine margins
28/12/23, 12:01 am - James: 19th to 11th?
28/12/23, 12:01 am - James: Or Emery last season?
28/12/23, 12:01 am - Gerrard: Exciting to both have great teams at the same time
28/12/23, 12:01 am - James: Or can only judge when it suits your screwed up narrative
28/12/23, 12:02 am - Dave: When did he get knighted?
28/12/23, 12:02 am - Dave: Did I miss that?
28/12/23, 12:02 am - James: So Sir Eddie has a better first full season than both your managers with a much worse team inherited?
28/12/23, 12:03 am - Dave: In the least competitive season ever
28/12/23, 12:03 am - Gerrard: Got knighted by a fat shirtless Gordie with a sausage roll
28/12/23, 12:03 am - Dave: The only teams that turned up were us and City. United were on the downfall. Chelsea and spurs checked out
28/12/23, 12:03 am - James: The covid season. Varpools only PL title?
28/12/23, 12:03 am - Dave: Liverpool broken
28/12/23, 12:04 am - Gerrard: Domination, was a special year
28/12/23, 12:04 am - James: Who they beat?
28/12/23, 12:04 am - Dave: Last season was an anomaly. Like 2016. Hence the comparison of Newty to Leicester
28/12/23, 12:05 am - Gerrard: They were a shell of themselves last year, what a rebuild Klopp has done - Howie could learn a thing or two
28/12/23, 12:06 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 how long is he gonna push this narrative?
It feels horrible being top 😢
28/12/23, 12:06 am - James: Where were you all last year. Was so quiet?
28/12/23, 12:07 am - James: That's OK you won't be for long... ⏳
28/12/23, 12:07 am - Gerrard: You could learn a thing or two from me, if your team's shit keep your mouth shut
28/12/23, 12:07 am - Gerrard: Never learns
28/12/23, 12:07 am - James: You didn't though. You'd slide in to my DMs and talk about livo
28/12/23, 12:07 am - James: You were an emotional mess
28/12/23, 12:08 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 he's gone off course now, you know he's rattled lol
28/12/23, 12:08 am - James: You moved away from Coogee you were that mentally unstable
28/12/23, 12:08 am - Gerrard: Arguing like a chick
28/12/23, 12:08 am - James: Only just realised last week you want to get your life back in order
28/12/23, 12:08 am - Gerrard: Put the phone down
28/12/23, 12:08 am - James: Because Varpool have won a few games 😂
28/12/23, 12:09 am - Gerrard: Wait until Newty win a game
28/12/23, 12:09 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 hey if Liverpool don't win it, I hope Arsenal does
28/12/23, 12:11 am - Dave: I’d be happy if anyone won it other than city at this point
28/12/23, 12:11 am - Dave: Other than United
28/12/23, 12:12 am - Liam: Spurs…..
28/12/23, 12:12 am - Gerrard: And Newty, imagine this toss bag if Newtle ever win something <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 12:13 am - Dave: Let’s be realistic here, that will never happen so no point in even discussing it
28/12/23, 12:13 am - Gerrard: Same
28/12/23, 12:20 am - Pero: They could of pinched a point dumb fucks
28/12/23, 12:20 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 12:20 am - Gerrard: I heard dodge pen too
28/12/23, 12:23 am - Dave: Still can’t believe Emery bottled a 2-0 lead against that shite United team
28/12/23, 12:24 am - Dave: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 12:25 am - Dave: Remember when he had to get 3 points from 5 games to secure us champions league and he bottled it @61422023136 @61478754484 ?
28/12/23, 12:25 am - Liam: Dark times
28/12/23, 12:26 am - Pero: So sad 😢
28/12/23, 12:28 am - Pero: Nikolas jackson is the shitest attacker in the league why do they keep playing him another one on one doesn't even hit the target
28/12/23, 12:28 am - Gerrard: I'm so happy that you guys are enjoying watching football again.
28/12/23, 3:53 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/VtaolqpXbt0?si=AsTSXBFGl0_DFkdV
28/12/23, 3:55 am - Gerrard: Tough question

28/12/23, 8:19 am - James: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 8:19 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I'm happy that Newtle won't get relegated this season and we can still watch games together
28/12/23, 8:20 am - James: We never watch games together. You're asleep by 9pm
28/12/23, 8:20 am - Gerrard: I'm happy you're enjoying watching football again
28/12/23, 8:21 am - James: Not at the moment but thanks anyway
28/12/23, 8:21 am - James: I hope for your sake you beat us next week
28/12/23, 8:22 am - Gerrard: Whatever will be, will be - by that I mean Liverpool in the top 4 and Newty falling into the bottom half
28/12/23, 8:23 am - James: Wanking over finishing top four these days. Wow, standards really have slipped the last 12 months...
28/12/23, 8:24 am - Gerrard: But you said all that matters is top 4, you breaking your own rules again?
28/12/23, 8:24 am - Gerrard: I'm so confused <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 8:24 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 8:24 am - James: Top four for Varpool is minimum
28/12/23, 8:25 am - Gerrard: Thank you
28/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gerrard: Thought you said he was better than Nunez
28/12/23, 1:05 pm - James: Reacton would be the same if it was a Nooni shirt
28/12/23, 9:32 pm - Chris: 100% still in. Goal
28/12/23, 9:32 pm - Pero: Disgraaace

28/12/23, 10:30 pm - Gerrard: Two in a row
28/12/23, 10:32 pm - James: Imagine ditching a shit CB and he comes back and scores 😂
28/12/23, 10:40 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/l7MgN9n6rW8?si=dilgB3nq10X5DzkB
28/12/23, 10:41 pm - Gerrard: Told you to take a break until Newty win a game again
28/12/23, 10:45 pm - Pero: Mavro still paying his respects not a cunt
28/12/23, 10:47 pm - Jono: If Arse win from here I’ll go as far to say they’ve won the league
28/12/23, 10:49 pm - Jono: I had a feeling that escape against Luton and over celebrating could be a little premature
28/12/23, 10:50 pm - Jono: They’ve only won 1 game since
28/12/23, 10:58 pm - Gerrard: Saka is a diver now?
28/12/23, 10:59 pm - Gerrard: Where did he learn that?
28/12/23, 11:00 pm - Liam: Was a pen
28/12/23, 11:00 pm - James: Sakashit
28/12/23, 11:00 pm - James: Diving cant

28/12/23, 11:01 pm - James: Rattled
28/12/23, 11:01 pm - Jono: Desperate on and off the field
28/12/23, 11:01 pm - Gerrard: Get back in your box Newtle boi

28/12/23, 11:02 pm - Jono: City laughing again
28/12/23, 11:03 pm - Jono: Just happy to be challenging
28/12/23, 11:03 pm - Jono: For titles
28/12/23, 11:03 pm - James: 'Challenging'
28/12/23, 11:03 pm - Jono: Instead of survival
28/12/23, 11:03 pm - Gerrard: Goldbridge is right about the penalty claiming, they did that claiming handball when Matip blocked a shot with the back of his thigh
28/12/23, 11:04 pm - James: Where is @14244893404
28/12/23, 11:04 pm - James: @14244893404 show us your bets for the game mate

28/12/23, 11:13 pm - James: Ward Prowse bossed rice
28/12/23, 11:14 pm - Liam: Get back in your 📦

28/12/23, 11:16 pm - Liam: Ya, fair play Moyes. He played it perfectly.
28/12/23, 11:16 pm - Pero: Yeh defensively blocking everything
28/12/23, 11:17 pm - Liam: 2 points behind a great Liverpool team, I will take that.
28/12/23, 11:18 pm - Liam: January transfer window could decide how the rest of the season plays out.
28/12/23, 11:19 pm - Gerrard: Get Tierney back
28/12/23, 11:19 pm - Pero: Ben white is starting to annoy me
28/12/23, 11:19 pm - Gerrard: His face?
28/12/23, 11:19 pm - Liam: Ya he isn’t as good as last year.
28/12/23, 11:20 pm - Pero: Saka was playing good today , Ben not utilising enough to saka and always putting foot on the ball and slowing everything down
28/12/23, 11:21 pm - Gerrard: How we feeling about that dive effort?
28/12/23, 11:22 pm - Pero: He got clipped twice is what I saw
28/12/23, 11:23 pm - Liam: Looked like a pen to me
28/12/23, 11:23 pm - Liam: + Ball looked out
28/12/23, 11:24 pm - Gerrard: Finally able to jump on AFTV again
28/12/23, 11:24 pm - Liam: I thought it was a pen on Jesus in the first half
28/12/23, 11:25 pm - Pero: Looked to me the ball was out
28/12/23, 11:25 pm - Pero: And it was a 🖊

28/12/23, 11:33 pm - Liam: Plus a pen and minus one goal for the hammers. 4-1 game
28/12/23, 11:38 pm - Dave: Corporate fans
28/12/23, 11:39 pm - Dave: Just wasn’t our day. Don’t know what the big drama is. It’s not like we don’t show up… *cough cough* Newtle
28/12/23, 11:44 pm - James: https://youtu.be/w8SKw7Si5ho?feature=shared
28/12/23, 11:45 pm - Gerrard: Same as I thought after United, some days don't go your way.
At least our season is still on track... *cough cough* Newtle

29/12/23, 1:16 am - Dave: Hammers had 3 shots on target. 2 went in and one was a pen that Raya saved. Rough day at the office. On top of that…
29/12/23, 1:16 am - Louie: Damn you guys got FMed
29/12/23, 1:17 am - Dave: Other than the fact the the ball was non existent in a picture straight down the line of *the line*
29/12/23, 1:19 am - Dave: Credit where credit is due to west ham, great result for them and everything went in their favour today. We need to do better if we’re going to challenge for trophies though. Have to start thinking outside the box, this isn’t the first time we’ve looked out of ideas when a team has parked the bus against us
29/12/23, 1:28 am - Gerrard: FMed hard
29/12/23, 1:29 am - Gerrard: Need a big dumb no.9 like Nunez
29/12/23, 1:32 am - Dave: Agree, he would be an asset, as long as he didn’t cost us 100m 😂
29/12/23, 1:33 am - Gerrard: Inflation innit

29/12/23, 3:52 am - Jono: When I said “over to you” to Arsenal. These kind of games emphasize it. Not looking good.
29/12/23, 4:02 am - Gerrard: Liverpool equal best def, 2nd best attack, only 1 loss due to ref fuckery - all good mate, nothing to worry about
29/12/23, 6:34 am - Jono: https://www.instagram.com/p/C1ahWkpSBf-/?igsh=MWU4NHl0dGF5MWc4Nw==
29/12/23, 6:34 am - Jono: Probs already been sent
29/12/23, 6:34 am - Jono: But cbf reading up 78 unreads
29/12/23, 7:16 am - Dave: Wild thing is, even with that level of dominance, we didn’t look capable of scoring. Very strange game
29/12/23, 7:17 am - Liam: Agreed
29/12/23, 7:18 am - Dave: Got to a point where the players were just smashing the ball at west ham out of frustration. Looked totally rattled
29/12/23, 7:18 am - Liam: January signings required
29/12/23, 7:30 am - Dave: Absolutely
29/12/23, 7:30 am - Dave: Couple of decent proven attacking additions and we’ll be unstoppable <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 7:34 am - Liam: Yep need more competition in that area
29/12/23, 8:02 am - Gerrard: I thought Saka and Martinelli were gods

29/12/23, 8:10 am - Gerrard: I reckon you need a good DM
29/12/23, 8:11 am - Gerrard: Endo would help you guys
29/12/23, 8:11 am - Liam: If all our players are fit, we need to bring in forwards.
29/12/23, 8:12 am - Gerrard: Play Balogun
29/12/23, 8:13 am - Liam: Cashed in on him
29/12/23, 8:14 am - Gerrard: Shit
29/12/23, 8:14 am - Gerrard: Play Lacazette
29/12/23, 8:14 am - Liam: Left for free
29/12/23, 8:15 am - Gerrard: Fark
29/12/23, 8:15 am - Gerrard: What about Giroud
29/12/23, 8:15 am - Liam: Sold him for 10m.
29/12/23, 8:15 am - Gerrard: Wtf
29/12/23, 8:16 am - Gerrard: Lord Bertner?
29/12/23, 8:16 am - Liam: Don’t actually know what happened to him
29/12/23, 11:35 am - Dave: No thank you 🤮
29/12/23, 11:37 am - Dave: He’d save the day 🙏
29/12/23, 11:38 am - Gerrard: Get Ian Wright kitted up
29/12/23, 11:38 am - Dave: What a man

29/12/23, 11:44 am - Dave: Just looking at your fixtures. I’ve got a sneaky suspicion Bournemouth are going to kill your run of form. Solanke special @61409710717
29/12/23, 11:45 am - Gerrard: I think we could've said this before every game this year, so I'm not gonna worry until afterwards
29/12/23, 11:48 am - Dave: True. Just wanted to send this message so I can reply to it in a few weeks and act the oracle

29/12/23, 11:48 am - Gerrard: Lol
29/12/23, 11:49 am - Dave: Racist. 

Rice is the signing of the season, Rolls Royce and everyone wants him
29/12/23, 11:50 am - Gerrard: You're racist, Special Fried Rice is Chinese and Endo is Japanese, but I guess they all look the same to you David
29/12/23, 11:51 am - Gerrard: *for 60m, not 100m

29/12/23, 9:30 pm - Liam: 2 points behind Liverpool, 19 games in, they have a great team and are only playing europa, after coming off a very disappointing season. <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 9:33 pm - Liam: Newcastle are totally irrelevant in any conversation. 📦
29/12/23, 10:01 pm - James: Someone is a rattle
29/12/23, 10:01 pm - James: FYI, I didn't say anything. It was your deceptive mate Jez
29/12/23, 10:02 pm - James: That said, can't be losing 2-0 at home to West Ham lol
29/12/23, 10:04 pm - Liam: Ya I’m ratttled, got me.
29/12/23, 10:14 pm - Dave: Right. Level of confidence in here is strange considering how many last minute scrappy winners and equalisers they’ve had. Liverpools slip us is pending lol. 

As for Newcastle. New who? 😂😂
29/12/23, 10:39 pm - James: All I'm seeing is regression. £160m spunked on Rice and Havertz and Varsenal are 10 pts worse off than same stage last season where they had a 10 point lead over citeh
29/12/23, 10:39 pm - James: Damaging
29/12/23, 10:42 pm - Liam: We are regressing and at the same time, we are having to best season of any club in the league. Through to the last 16 of CL and 2 points off top.
29/12/23, 10:43 pm - Liam: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 10:46 pm - Dave: Best part will be seeing the cherries and Wolverhampton leap frog newty. They’re on fire at the moment

30/12/23, 8:15 pm - Jono: This I reckon
30/12/23, 9:19 pm - Liam: Na Jimmity is right, our only hope is for a win at Fulham and for newty to somehow how get a result against Liverpool. The odds are against us.
30/12/23, 10:53 pm - Dave: Newty getting a result at Liverpool, behave. Heard Klopp is just putting Nunez on the pitch alone and resting the rest of the squad. 3-0 Liverpool my prediction
30/12/23, 10:59 pm - Liam: Fuck they need a result against Liverpool. Newtys next 2 matches are city and villa…. Chelsea and wolves are only 2 points behind. Bottom half of the table incoming!!!
30/12/23, 11:00 pm - Liam: …. Page 2

30/12/23, 11:38 pm - Gerrard: Self inflicted
30/12/23, 11:40 pm - Louie: But yes we are ass at the moment. ETH took off Mainoo for McTominay hoping he could get a goal. All he did was ghost that match and leave space in front of the back four, for Forest to score.
30/12/23, 11:41 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/TO7YbEh3di0?si=qS0eDeFpow3Hvg23

30/12/23, 11:46 pm - Gerrard: We turfed them, as you should
30/12/23, 11:46 pm - Louie: Why are you naming Liverpool players?
30/12/23, 11:47 pm - Gerrard: This is uncalled for
30/12/23, 11:47 pm - Gerrard: You just ruined @61404060785 sunday
30/12/23, 11:47 pm - Louie: Liverpool fans can’t say slippery and not expect repercussions
30/12/23, 11:47 pm - Gerrard: Forgot all about it after that 7-0 business
30/12/23, 11:48 pm - Louie: 7-0 didn’t win you the league though
30/12/23, 11:49 pm - Gerrard: Neither did the slip so no diff
30/12/23, 11:51 pm - Louie: Ah fuck City won it that year
30/12/23, 11:51 pm - Louie: My bad
30/12/23, 11:52 pm - Gerrard: Oh Lou, using your city rivals victories for clout - how the mighty United has fallen....

31/12/23, 7:53 am - James: Shouldn't you be celebrating the new year or something!? Have you got Tam over strapped to a chair watching Gerrard highlights on YouTube?
31/12/23, 8:06 am - Dave: Rumour has it, they’re having a “watch arsenal go top of the table again party” to welcome in the new year
31/12/23, 8:07 am - James: Nah he'll be asleep by 8
31/12/23, 8:08 am - James: He'll catch up with the three min new year highlights tomorrow

31/12/23, 9:47 am - Gerrard: Have faith brother
31/12/23, 9:47 am - Dave: Should be a 3 pointer. Feel pretty dejected after west ham. Just not firing in final third this season
31/12/23, 10:11 am - Jono: https://x.com/caseysean51/status/1741380274791829598?s=46&t=O7A3WAinzMcTPmYMqZ3Dpw
31/12/23, 10:35 am - Pero: Kai should be back from suspension right ? We'll be alrite to get the 3 pts
31/12/23, 10:41 am - Gerrard: Why suspend?
31/12/23, 11:22 am - Pero: Too many yellows

31/12/23, 4:36 pm - Dave: When is Afcon?
31/12/23, 4:49 pm - Jono: After this round
31/12/23, 4:50 pm - Jono: Fulham dominating here. wtf is going on lol
31/12/23, 4:57 pm - Jono: 1 win from 5 don’t win dem titles
31/12/23, 4:59 pm - James: 4pts from 5 games for Varsenal 😂😂😂
31/12/23, 4:59 pm - James: @14244893404 regression!?
31/12/23, 5:00 pm - James: Varsenal had the chance to pull away from a citeh side without haaland and KDB and decided to bottle it early this season lols
31/12/23, 5:00 pm - James: @14244893404 show us ya bets lad?
31/12/23, 5:01 pm - James: <Media omitted>
31/12/23, 5:03 pm - Jono: Solid bottle job hey. Wrighty summed it best. Last year they had excuses because of several injuries at the back and up front. This year, no excuse.
31/12/23, 5:04 pm - James: They said they were title challengers this season and they're well behind what they were last year and still fucked it up then 😂
31/12/23, 5:05 pm - James: Think Varsenal will be battling to get top four at this rate. £250m spent in the summer too 😬
31/12/23, 5:06 pm - Jono: Spurs only 1 point behind them with a solid injury list
31/12/23, 5:06 pm - James: Varsenal not even had injuries
31/12/23, 5:07 pm - James: Two defeats to two London rivals too 😬
31/12/23, 5:09 pm - James: I suspect they'll be out the FA Cup next week as well 😬
31/12/23, 5:10 pm - James: The only win they've had in the last five was a 97th minute win away to Luton!

31/12/23, 6:05 pm - Dave: No excuses. We looked shite today.
31/12/23, 6:06 pm - Dave: Jesus is so infuriating to watch, gets so many chances and doesn’t go for them. Eddie non existent. In desperate need of an overhaul up top
31/12/23, 6:07 pm - Dave: Just looked frustrated and out of ideas
31/12/23, 6:07 pm - Dave: Rough month
31/12/23, 6:07 pm - Dave: City turned a corner. KDB about to be back. Was fun while it lasted
31/12/23, 6:25 pm - Dave: What did he bottle? The top at new year title?

1/1/24, 12:36 am - Pero: What a shite game by the gunners !
1/1/24, 12:36 am - Dave: Kroenke better open his wallet in Jan the tight cunt, it’s time to start spending!!!

1/1/24, 12:36 am - Dave: Enough is enough!!!
1/1/24, 12:36 am - Pero: Yep indeed!!!
1/1/24, 12:37 am - Dave: We’re starving over here for some big money transfers!!!!
1/1/24, 12:38 am - Pero: We had no centre forward last season so we relied on Martinelli banging in goals and assists on a weekly basis . Now he is off form and we still don't have a centre forward and we can't score enough goals
1/1/24, 12:46 am - Dave: Honestly. Jesus and Eddie were woeful today. They don’t even go for anything mate
1/1/24, 12:47 am - Dave: Get fed every fucking week and barely try to get a foot or a head on it
1/1/24, 12:48 am - Pero: Yeh its really frustrating we need our forwards to score that's their job
1/1/24, 12:50 am - Liam: New striker required.
1/1/24, 12:57 am - Gerrard: Martinelli quiet and Saka only scored by being offside.
Need a RB and LB too.
1/1/24, 1:22 am - Chris: Arteta said same players for the rest of the season. I wonder if he keeps his word
1/1/24, 1:49 am - Gerrard: I'm not talking shit here, but...... did Arsenal's last title challenge go off the rails after a draw against Liverpool at Anfield.....?
1/1/24, 2:22 am - Liam: Fact
1/1/24, 2:25 am - Gerrard: Rough facts
1/1/24, 2:25 am - Dave: lol fuck
1/1/24, 2:25 am - Dave: Good shout
1/1/24, 2:25 am - Dave: The curse of anfield strikes again
1/1/24, 2:26 am - Dave: 🤡🔫
1/1/24, 2:26 am - Dave: Well we’re fucked then. Hope you boys win it over city, will have to get a Liverpool shirt
1/1/24, 2:26 am - Gerrard: Sorry lads, it occurred to me as I was grog bogging
1/1/24, 2:28 am - Gerrard: I've been sizing you guys up since two years ago and waiting to order them online, say the word - I'll never mention a thing about it ever
1/1/24, 2:33 am - Dave: Will you laugh at me if I start singing YNWA in the pub?
1/1/24, 2:34 am - Gerrard: Nah I've already been purged from the time Liam did it

1/1/24, 9:46 pm - Gerrard: Saudi money in the refs pocket
1/1/24, 9:52 pm - James: Softest penalty award of the season
1/1/24, 9:53 pm - James: Karma with that miss lols
1/1/24, 9:53 pm - James: Klippy so rattled already
1/1/24, 9:53 pm - Gerrard: Gonna be another 0-0 against a mid table team
1/1/24, 9:53 pm - James: What's that say about varpool
1/1/24, 9:54 pm - James: 'title challengers' 😂
1/1/24, 9:54 pm - Gerrard: Joeling no yellow but yellows for Diaz and Trent
1/1/24, 9:54 pm - Gerrard: 🤑
1/1/24, 9:54 pm - James: Good fucking rats
1/1/24, 9:54 pm - James: Miley yellow was a joke too
1/1/24, 9:54 pm - Gerrard: Gonna say we're top
1/1/24, 9:54 pm - Gerrard: Red
1/1/24, 9:54 pm - James: Salah rat diver
1/1/24, 9:54 pm - Gerrard: Saudi money
1/1/24, 9:55 pm - Gerrard: Lining the refs coffers
1/1/24, 9:55 pm - James: Citeh are going to pump you
1/1/24, 9:55 pm - Gerrard: Bet the refs NYE party was lit with all that Saudi money
1/1/24, 9:57 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 is it a nice throwback to how you grew up watching Newty getting to see them get dominated again these days?
1/1/24, 9:57 pm - James: Salah gone for a month after today minimum 😂
1/1/24, 9:57 pm - Gerrard: Wha?
1/1/24, 9:58 pm - Gerrard: You gotta make more sense when typing a message
1/1/24, 9:58 pm - James: Brilliant dive Diaz 👏
1/1/24, 9:59 pm - Gerrard: Nunez might break his streak against Newtle and not score
1/1/24, 10:15 pm - James: Varpool vs Dubravka
1/1/24, 10:19 pm - Dave: Isak is class, that’s what Klopp wanted when he signed Nunez
1/1/24, 10:19 pm - Dave: Made that goal look so effortless
1/1/24, 10:19 pm - Dave: Be shocked if Liverpool don’t come away with 3 points here. Newcastle have looked wank the entire game apart from that counter. Could be an Arsenal west ham 2.0 though
1/1/24, 10:21 pm - Gerrard: Newty looking like a team scrounging for points in a relegation battle
1/1/24, 10:21 pm - Gerrard: They could pull a Luton here
1/1/24, 10:24 pm - Dave: Dubrovka quality. Might take popes spot
1/1/24, 10:24 pm - Gerrard: Jesus, Nunez really can't score lol
1/1/24, 10:25 pm - Gerrard: Not bhed Subs <This message was edited>
1/1/24, 10:25 pm - Dave: He’s got to be the biggest flop you’ve ever signed
1/1/24, 10:26 pm - Dave: Taking into consideration what he cost
1/1/24, 10:26 pm - Gerrard: Nah we've had worse
1/1/24, 10:26 pm - Liam: Andy Carrol
1/1/24, 10:26 pm - Dave: Andy Carroll is the closest I can think of and he cost a third of the price
1/1/24, 10:26 pm - Gerrard: Inflation knobhead
1/1/24, 10:27 pm - Dave: So Caroll bigger or lesser flop?
1/1/24, 10:27 pm - Dave: I’ve seen Nunez miss like 4 big chances in the past ten mins
1/1/24, 10:28 pm - Gerrard: Aquilani
1/1/24, 10:28 pm - Gerrard: Rickie Lambert
1/1/24, 10:28 pm - Gerrard: Poulsen
1/1/24, 10:30 pm - Gerrard: Jesus
1/1/24, 10:30 pm - Gerrard: Fark
1/1/24, 10:31 pm - Gerrard: Lol who'd have thought that without Popey and Trippsey, Newtle's defence got better
1/1/24, 10:31 pm - Gerrard: 28-3 shots, gonna be robbery
1/1/24, 10:33 pm - Gerrard: Can I blame the rain like Ty does?
1/1/24, 10:35 pm - Gerrard: Jota is SO noice
1/1/24, 10:41 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 every game bro, freak out for 75mins then it all gets sorted
1/1/24, 10:41 pm - Dave: Jota is class
1/1/24, 10:41 pm - Liam: Poor old newty 😢
1/1/24, 10:42 pm - Gerrard: Back in it
1/1/24, 10:45 pm - Liam: That is not a pen
1/1/24, 10:46 pm - Gerrard: Elbow to the ankle, not a pen?
1/1/24, 10:46 pm - Liam: Him diving is not a pen
1/1/24, 10:46 pm - Dave: No way in a month of Sundays is that a pen
1/1/24, 10:46 pm - Dave: Awful call
1/1/24, 10:46 pm - Liam: Contact doesn’t mean pen
1/1/24, 10:47 pm - Gerrard: You guys are farked
1/1/24, 10:47 pm - Liam: Football is dead
1/1/24, 10:47 pm - Gerrard: Run full pelt and someone elbows your ankle
1/1/24, 10:47 pm - Gerrard: I thought you guys were just and fair
1/1/24, 10:47 pm - Liam: I can’t believe they didn’t overrule that
1/1/24, 10:48 pm - Gerrard: I thought we had a mutual respect, and now that Arsenal is out of the title race that you'd hope Liverpool to do well.
And now this.....
1/1/24, 10:49 pm - Gerrard: Diiiiiiiiiiiiissssssgraceful
1/1/24, 10:50 pm - Liam: That pen was a disgrace
1/1/24, 10:51 pm - Gerrard: #prayforhowie
1/1/24, 10:52 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 that assistant manager got nothing to say today?
1/1/24, 10:55 pm - James: Two pens that weren't pens
1/1/24, 10:55 pm - James: What do you expect at anfield
1/1/24, 10:55 pm - Dave: Gakpo offside and incorrect pen call
1/1/24, 10:55 pm - James: Crowd decided to wake up at 4-2 in the last minute
1/1/24, 10:55 pm - Jono: lol
1/1/24, 10:55 pm - Gerrard: I expected better from you David
1/1/24, 10:56 pm - Dave: 2-2 should have been the result. Hate to say it. Liverpool by far the better team and totally dominant. But Newcastle deserved the point here
1/1/24, 10:56 pm - James: Didn't see that stream is awful
1/1/24, 10:56 pm - Liam: It did look offside
1/1/24, 10:56 pm - Dave: They didn’t even draw a line
1/1/24, 10:56 pm - Dave: Classic VAR
1/1/24, 10:56 pm - James: Surprised they allowed the Isak goal
1/1/24, 10:56 pm - James: Looked close
1/1/24, 10:57 pm - James: Means nothing really. These ain't winning the league lol
1/1/24, 10:58 pm - James: He is so shit. I can't fathom how he gets away with it 18 months into his career wearing the no.9
1/1/24, 10:58 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 🥹
1/1/24, 10:59 pm - Jono: This chat is exactly where I want it

1/1/24, 11:00 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 don't look at the table
1/1/24, 11:01 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 Kloppy did the fist pumps
1/1/24, 11:01 pm - James: Fuck me just saw the Jota one 😂
1/1/24, 11:02 pm - James: What a dive 😂

1/1/24, 11:03 pm - Jono: Maybe Jimmy can find a new reason for Newtle being mid table again other than injuries 🎻
1/1/24, 11:03 pm - Gerrard: But Trippsy was injured bro
1/1/24, 11:03 pm - James: We look at the table same stage last year you were 9th. Doesn't matter till game 38 bud
1/1/24, 11:04 pm - James: Varpool had to cheat against a mid table club?
1/1/24, 11:05 pm - Jono: This chat right now ⬆️
1/1/24, 11:05 pm - Gerrard: @61404060785 ooooooo I love a biased freeze frame
1/1/24, 11:06 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 two taps in on the "best defence in the league"
1/1/24, 11:06 pm - Dave: Lost his wedding ring for a moment on the pitch 😂😂
1/1/24, 11:06 pm - Gerrard: Lol saw that, would've been in the doghouse
1/1/24, 11:06 pm - Liam: This was a disgrace
1/1/24, 11:06 pm - Gerrard: Don't think we can be friends anymore
1/1/24, 11:07 pm - Dave: Look, let’s be honest. A fair result would have been like 8-2 Liverpool lol
1/1/24, 11:07 pm - Liam: Jota should of saw a yellow
1/1/24, 11:07 pm - Jono: A lot of butthurt Arsenal fans here today…
1/1/24, 11:07 pm - Dave: But just from the second half I watched, those two calls were fucking awful. Offside and pen. Especially the pen. Jota should have been booked for those awful theatrics
1/1/24, 11:07 pm - Jono: Make some noise!
1/1/24, 11:07 pm - Liam: I would agree with that
1/1/24, 11:07 pm - Gerrard: The big teams are gonna drop points this season, tough season
1/1/24, 11:07 pm - Dave: I’m not butthurt. I want Liverpool to beat city
1/1/24, 11:08 pm - Dave: We’re out the title race
1/1/24, 11:08 pm - Jono: 4 buttfucks in 5 games
1/1/24, 11:08 pm - Dave: Confirmed the moment arteta said he’s not signing anyone in Jan
1/1/24, 11:08 pm - Jono: Oh come on! I thought today was this chats nirvana
1/1/24, 11:09 pm - Dave: Sorry, you want me to pretend to hate Liverpool now. Wouldn’t want to deprive you fans of your post-win chub
1/1/24, 11:10 pm - Dave: “LiVARpool are fucking shit and Newty were robbed!!!!”
1/1/24, 11:10 pm - Gerrard: ....Jimmity?
1/1/24, 11:11 pm - Gerrard: 3! 3 tap ins

1/1/24, 11:13 pm - Jono: What a man
1/1/24, 11:13 pm - Jono: What a day
1/1/24, 11:15 pm - Dave: Do you think isak will push for a move in Jan or summer? Player of his calibre must be devastated playing for a team like Newty
1/1/24, 11:17 pm - James: At least you're honest unlike the bin dippers lol
1/1/24, 11:18 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 who has Livo beat?

1/1/24, 11:18 pm - James: In the top six only villa 😂
1/1/24, 11:21 pm - Gerrard: Oh poor thing, he's never been in a title race so doesn't know what it looks like
1/1/24, 11:21 pm - Gerrard: So Newty isn't a top 6 team?
1/1/24, 11:22 pm - Gerrard: I thought you said you're what you were last year until this season is finished

2/1/24, 5:21 am - Gerrard: We appreciates him just fine
2/1/24, 5:28 am - Dave: Come to Arsenal jota ❤️
2/1/24, 5:29 am - Gerrard: I thinks youse gotta starts appreciatesing Aaron
2/1/24, 5:29 am - Pero: He even dived this morning  trying to get noticed
2/1/24, 5:29 am - Gerrard: Poor kid
2/1/24, 5:29 am - Gerrard: His dad's due to shoot off at the mouth again
2/1/24, 5:31 am - Pero: He would start every match and get appreciated , come join the gunners !
2/1/24, 5:32 am - Gerrard: .....hang on, who does he start over if your boys are so goats?
2/1/24, 5:42 am - Pero: He would start as striker
2/1/24, 5:57 am - Dave: Eddie or Jesus
2/1/24, 6:07 am - Gerrard: So quick to turf them out
2/1/24, 6:07 am - Gerrard: No hesitation
2/1/24, 6:08 am - Pero: Jesus can challenge martinelli on left wing and rotate as needed
2/1/24, 6:08 am - Gerrard: He won't like that
2/1/24, 6:08 am - Pero: Martinelli can also play right to give saka break
2/1/24, 6:08 am - Gerrard: Saka benched???
2/1/24, 6:08 am - Pero: Rotation
2/1/24, 6:10 am - Pero: Some else like jota is needed to have rotation options up front
2/1/24, 6:10 am - Gerrard: So we should keep him at Livo then
2/1/24, 6:11 am - Pero: Jota wouldn't be rotated at arsenal, his presence will allow the others to rotate
2/1/24, 6:19 am - Dave: I’ve wanted Eddie gone for two years, not good enough
2/1/24, 6:19 am - Gerrard: Oofft
2/1/24, 6:19 am - Gerrard: Should've kept Balogun
2/1/24, 6:23 am - Dave: Had plenty of chances to step up. Bit toxic as well
2/1/24, 6:24 am - Gerrard: Republican?

2/1/24, 8:03 am - Gerrard: @61422023136 @14244893404 are we going to start talking about Endo>Rice?
2/1/24, 8:06 am - Jono: Was at a no reception beach today all day looking forward to chilling out reading all the tears on here…

Hereee weeeee gooooo
2/1/24, 8:08 am - Jono: Still no idea what xG is. But fuck it we’re amazing
2/1/24, 8:08 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 Jimmity turned his phone off while sleeping but it's morning in Europe so should be back online soon
2/1/24, 8:09 am - Jono: HAHAHA
2/1/24, 8:09 am - Jono: HAHAHAHAHA
2/1/24, 8:09 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 Liam is just trolling, I know what's in his heart (YNWA)
2/1/24, 8:09 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 Dave's just in shock from the bottle job
2/1/24, 8:10 am - Jono: Don’t let a few incidents get in the way of what was complete and utter domination of the Newtle Footyball Club
2/1/24, 8:11 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 the Kickoff is a fun watch
2/1/24, 8:11 am - Jono: The 4 December buttfucks have really impacted the Arsenal content on here
2/1/24, 8:12 am - Jono: Deeeeeesgrace
2/1/24, 8:13 am - Gerrard: "CORRUPTION"
2/1/24, 8:14 am - Jono: Dubravka deserves some cred. Without him it’s 8-2
2/1/24, 8:16 am - Liam: Poor Newcastle ☹️
2/1/24, 8:16 am - Liam: Its not fair ☹️
2/1/24, 8:17 am - Jono: He won’t leave. Liverpool is a great city to play PS5 in
2/1/24, 8:18 am - Jono: Nuh he’s cool with it. He’s injured at least 2 months a season and we’ve learnt to accept that. Not many clubs would
2/1/24, 9:06 am - Gerrard: Hurry up on those charges so we can sign him
2/1/24, 9:10 am - Pero: They can hardly be spoken about in the same sentence
2/1/24, 9:22 am - Gerrard: Oh no Salah AND Endo are gone for Jan
2/1/24, 9:22 am - Jono: Macca is back
2/1/24, 9:22 am - Jono: That ball thru to Jota 😍
2/1/24, 9:22 am - Gerrard: Not a DM <This message was edited>
2/1/24, 9:22 am - Jono: Before he got taken out by the keeper
2/1/24, 9:22 am - Gerrard: Better with Endo than Mac
2/1/24, 9:23 am - Jono: Mac can handle it

Lots of Liverpool bashing here but let’s take a minute to enjoy this exquisite counter
2/1/24, 9:52 am - Gerrard: Relentless
2/1/24, 9:56 am - Jono: Whos this lazy fucker 
2/1/24, 9:56 am - Jono: Can’t tell if Gordon or Bruno
2/1/24, 9:56 am - Gerrard: One of those blonde wankers in that "team"
2/1/24, 9:57 am - Jono: Had front pos over Szob and just let him take it
2/1/24, 9:57 am - Jono: Clearly not playing for Howe
2/1/24, 9:57 am - Gerrard: Think they've given up on this season
2/1/24, 9:58 am - Jono: https://youtu.be/UBsIGF-KZZw?si=NIW4Eexr-UCZaIl5
2/1/24, 10:04 am - Gerrard: Someone knock on Jimmity's box and wake him up
2/1/24, 10:05 am - Jono: @61452662705 🧐🤨☹️😩😔🥸😎🤯🥺😩🫠🫥🫡

2/1/24, 10:19 am - James: @14244893404 these losers still wanking over beating a so called shit mid table team?
2/1/24, 10:19 am - James: Typical varpool init
2/1/24, 10:20 am - Gerrard: GOOOOOOOOOOD MORNING NEWTLE!!!!!!!!!!!
2/1/24, 10:20 am - Gerrard: It's all for you bro
2/1/24, 10:20 am - Gerrard: We've missed you
2/1/24, 10:20 am - James: @14244893404 something wrong with this guy
2/1/24, 10:21 am - James: Thought he was going to focus his time and energy sorting his life out lol
2/1/24, 10:21 am - Gerrard: You spelled my name with a G, I win
2/1/24, 10:21 am - Gerrard: NEVER
2/1/24, 10:21 am - James: Jan 2nd and he has failed already
2/1/24, 10:21 am - Gerrard: Can't fail if you don't try!
2/1/24, 10:22 am - Gerrard: Like Newtle's midfield
2/1/24, 10:23 am - James: You should be proud of your cheating team
2/1/24, 10:24 am - Gerrard: Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed today
2/1/24, 10:25 am - James: Wrighty knows
2/1/24, 10:25 am - Gerrard: Let's talk about Newty's performance then
2/1/24, 10:26 am - Gerrard: Anyone got that post of Wright contradicting himself on this topic?
2/1/24, 10:26 am - Gerrard: Already been posted today, come on lad it's ok
2/1/24, 10:26 am - Gerrard: One more week of top half
2/1/24, 10:27 am - James: 'lad'
2/1/24, 10:27 am - James: 😂😂😂
2/1/24, 10:27 am - James: Get in the bin
2/1/24, 10:27 am - James: @14244893404 he thinks he's a scouser now 😂😂😂
2/1/24, 10:27 am - Gerrard: I think we'll all be supporting Newtle next match round
2/1/24, 10:27 am - Gerrard: We can watch it together
2/1/24, 10:31 am - Gerrard: If Newty win we'll all celebrate together, but when they lose then the rest of us can have a laugh at bottom half Jimmity.
2/1/24, 10:37 am - Jono: Welcome @61452662705 
This is a safe place. 9 losses for the season and it’s 2nd Jan. Even in our disaster season we only managed to lose 9. 🤭
2/1/24, 10:41 am - Gerrard: Record breakers
2/1/24, 10:42 am - Gerrard: What's the lowest finishing place for a team that started the season in the CL?
2/1/24, 10:42 am - Jono: I’m sure Chelsea that year Mourinho almost had them relegated
2/1/24, 10:43 am - Gerrard: 🤞🏻
2/1/24, 10:43 am - Jono: When Hazard started eating too many pies
2/1/24, 10:43 am - Gerrard: Toon Army loves pies
2/1/24, 10:43 am - Jono: Their pies taste bitter these days

2/1/24, 11:47 am - Jono: Geez if Trent’s cross shot had gone in… 🥵
2/1/24, 11:47 am - Gerrard: Jimmity would never leave that box
2/1/24, 4:45 pm - Dave: I was trolling to be fair
2/1/24, 4:53 pm - Dave: Good to see big Ange moaning like a little bitch as well. Should have all got behind Arteta at the time instead of tearing him down, hilarious
2/1/24, 4:54 pm - Dave: “Refs are likes policemen’s aren’t they mates, I’d never question one’s of their decisions, just gets on with the game mates”
2/1/24, 10:02 pm - Gerrard: Mate...... Klopp was first and you all made jokes, you missed your chance to gang up on refs
2/1/24, 10:10 pm - Dave: Reason everyone laughed at Klopp is because you benefit more from dodgy VAR calls than anyone else in the league
2/1/24, 10:11 pm - Gerrard: Wa wa wa, keep up your lies
2/1/24, 10:11 pm - Dave: Arteta getting mocked was a witch hunt hate crime 😢
2/1/24, 10:11 pm - Gerrard: This is why no one likes Arsenal supporters
2/1/24, 10:11 pm - Dave: I didn’t realise you lose endo this month as well
2/1/24, 10:11 pm - Dave: Ouch
2/1/24, 10:14 pm - Gerrard: Huge loss, it's as if Rice was a better player and then you lost him for a month
2/1/24, 10:28 pm - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1bfwg1CCvf/?igsh=a2dlOHlyaHJqZmZm
2/1/24, 10:28 pm - Gerrard: That can't be a real post
2/1/24, 10:34 pm - Dave: Here’s my prediction that you didn’t ask for.

Struggle central this month for Liverpool. Get some awful results. Before Salah gets injured by a part time bus driver in Afcon. 

“Title race” over
2/1/24, 10:35 pm - Gerrard: Prediction or wish?
2/1/24, 10:37 pm - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0ggk-gNAUz/?igsh=MWhvNWJteGFkNGVkbA==
Big call
2/1/24, 10:37 pm - Dave: Don’t put words in my mouth, horrible accusation

2/1/24, 10:54 pm - Dave: “Klopp must be stopped” 😂😂😂 from what? Winning?
2/1/24, 10:59 pm - Gerrard: Lol he's a dickhead apparently
2/1/24, 11:00 pm - Gerrard: These Newty fans are really losing the plot this year
2/1/24, 11:00 pm - Gerrard: A little taste of success and they give it the biggun
2/1/24, 11:02 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/LB198kcdFUw?si=sOQW3F4zCtUpqqaY
2/1/24, 11:02 pm - Dave: Just watched the video. Can’t stand true Geordie but got to agree with him on this one
2/1/24, 11:03 pm - Dave: Klopp is an unbearable cunt on the pitch. And he definitely sways decisions. But I’d love him at Arsenal. Great if you’re a Liverpool fan
2/1/24, 11:04 pm - Dave: Glad arteta is getting worse, hope he ends up as bad as Klopp if it means we bully our way to a couple of trophies 🙏
2/1/24, 11:04 pm - Gerrard: Stop trolling, you love him
2/1/24, 11:05 pm - Gerrard: Watch the pitch side vid with Jimmity's twin rabbling

David Moans
3/1/24, 1:16 am - Dave: Arsenal buying him
3/1/24, 1:17 am - Gerrard: What about Toney?
3/1/24, 1:32 am - Dave: This bloke is fucking insufferable. Smarmy, smug, conceited and knows jack shit
3/1/24, 1:32 am - Dave: Even his voice. Instantly makes my blood pressure go up lol
3/1/24, 1:34 am - Pero: 100 percent agree. He is talking through his ass regarding this. We definetly need a striker, how many headers and chances has jesus put wide. Someone more clinical would have bagged another 3 or 4 goals and then it's a different story we would still be top of the league
3/1/24, 1:35 am - Pero: It's just like Liverpool if they relied on poonez this whole time they would be 5th or 6th but they got mo and even Diaz is clinical to bag them those needed goals
3/1/24, 1:41 am - Dave: “Arsenal need a winger” 

What’s this chopper smoking. We had two of the most formidable wingers in league last season bagging 30 odd goals and 20 assists and he thinks we need to replace one? I switched it off when I heard that. 

Definitely need a striker, I can’t watch Jesus or Eddie fumble one more chance or not even attempt to go for it. 

I saw someone else talking about Arsenal this season trying to be too perfect with build up play and not getting scrappy enough - completely agree with that. 

Think Timber being fit again will be a HUGE addition to the squad moving forward- think he’ll knock zinny out of the squad. And arteta definitely needs to tweak things and go back to the drawing board, we’re missing Xhaka and partey more than anyone’s letting on in my opinion
3/1/24, 1:43 am - Dave: Hope not. Way too expensive and reckon he’s toxic
3/1/24, 1:43 am - Dave: And hasn’t played for like a year
3/1/24, 1:48 am - Gerrard: He's backing your boys though
3/1/24, 1:54 am - Dave: Bin Laden supported Arsenal. Wasn’t on my Christmas card list
3/1/24, 2:40 am - Pero: Agree with that , seems like arsenal want to walk it in the net the last few games. Pull the trigger every now and then and mix it up ! 

If you didn't hear it Rory even mentioned it was a mistake to let pepe go.
Although pepe had class there are alot more priority positions and other more critical things discuss then pepe
3/1/24, 2:54 am - Gerrard changed the group name from "Title Challengers Group Chat + Jimmity" to "Title Challengers & Arsenal Fans Group Chat + Box Boi"
3/1/24, 5:40 am - Gerrard: Just wanted to check the updated stats
3/1/24, 7:23 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/oNUVn_Av--Y?si=qIU6CTjqWXMHSpb7
Jimmity's mate is copping it for his rattle job
3/1/24, 7:45 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Morning 👋🏻
3/1/24, 7:45 am - James: He's an absolute freak. The whole playing up to the cameras when sky are in town. Not watching the pen because he knew a camera was on him. Weirdo
3/1/24, 7:47 am - James: @14244893404 Salah away for potentially 8 games 😂
3/1/24, 7:47 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I said Good Morning 👋🏻
3/1/24, 7:49 am - James: Definition of a one man team. No Salah no fun
3/1/24, 7:49 am - James: Isak is everything Varpool fans want poonez to be
3/1/24, 7:50 am - Dave: Yeah, the level of confidence I’ve seen from Liverpool fans after our second loss is going to be short lived I fear
3/1/24, 7:50 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 7:50 am - James: Same every season. It's why everyone hates varpool
3/1/24, 7:50 am - Dave: And endo (the midfielder apparently far superior to rice) is also out for a month or so
3/1/24, 7:50 am - James: Has Jota gone down yet or?
3/1/24, 7:51 am - Gerrard: We lost Salah and Mane last time and did just fine baby
3/1/24, 7:51 am - James: Typical Portuguese
3/1/24, 7:51 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 7:51 am - James: @14244893404 remember when Jezzy wezzy had a go about Saka supposedly diving
3/1/24, 7:51 am - James: Jota wins the award this season
3/1/24, 7:52 am - James: Cheating scum
3/1/24, 7:52 am - Dave: I saw a stat somewhere recently that said salah is involved with 60% of your goals
3/1/24, 7:52 am - Gerrard: It's strange we're so far apart on this, I thought stonewall pen 🤷🏼‍♂️
3/1/24, 7:52 am - Dave: And Endo is the superstar and Mac is the basic bitch right? So you don’t think their absence will affect your results at all?
3/1/24, 7:53 am - James: @61409710717 did you see 17 year old mileys tackle on Salah. It was perfect and the dirty Egyptian was screaming for a red
3/1/24, 7:53 am - Gerrard: Endo>Mac>Ricey
3/1/24, 7:53 am - Dave: Saka gets mauled every game. Jota is a dirty cunt
3/1/24, 7:53 am - James: @14244893404 I've failed to find anyone who isn't associated with Varpool say it was a pen lol
3/1/24, 7:53 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 7:53 am - James: Even anti Newcastle Simon Jordon said it was a disgrace
3/1/24, 7:54 am - Dave: Salah is going to get mauled by a part time plumber at AFCON and be out rest of the season. “Title charge” over
3/1/24, 7:54 am - Gerrard: 🤣 you don't know anyone else 🤣
3/1/24, 7:54 am - James: What title charge!? 😂 <This message was edited>
3/1/24, 7:54 am - Gerrard: Slave owners
3/1/24, 7:54 am - James: Hope citeh win the league
3/1/24, 7:55 am - James: Would be embarrassing for the prem otherwise
3/1/24, 7:55 am - James: Salah is going to Saudi
3/1/24, 7:56 am - Dave: FSG dicing with death hanging onto him, one injury away from 100m ➡️ 5m
3/1/24, 7:58 am - Dave: @61452662705 are Liverpool going to win a trophy this season? Maybe Europa?
3/1/24, 7:59 am - Dave: Or Liverpool going Toulouse Europa as well?
3/1/24, 7:59 am - James: Would be embarrassing if they don't win the carabou. Think Leverkusen are a way better team than Varpool so they won't win Europa. No chance prem
3/1/24, 7:59 am - James: @14244893404 I think you'll smesh them this weekend
3/1/24, 8:00 am - Dave: Because they took xhaka from us 😢😭
3/1/24, 8:00 am - James: @14244893404 we're in rotten form and on our arse and still got two legit goals. Their defence is wank
3/1/24, 8:01 am - Dave: Arteta should use that against them on Sunday
3/1/24, 8:02 am - Dave: Lure them in, open up and play defensively, let them in then counter repeatedly
3/1/24, 8:02 am - Dave: Exploit that shambles at the back
3/1/24, 8:02 am - James: They're just a counter attacking team now. That's how they score. Like manure but they have hundreds of million pounds worth of talent up top to rotate
3/1/24, 8:02 am - James: Been lucky with no injuries and very friendly fixture list
3/1/24, 8:03 am - Dave: Never wanted him to go
3/1/24, 8:03 am - Dave: Arsenal legend
3/1/24, 8:04 am - James: You have a proper no 6 to mop up their counters. Saka and Martinelli will roast Trent and Gomes
3/1/24, 8:17 am - Dave: Maybe last season. Last two games haven’t filled me with any confidence 🤣
3/1/24, 8:17 am - James: All teams have a rough month
3/1/24, 8:18 am - James: Klips antics are working in Europe. Brand Klopp is doing so well with his freak behaviour he's scored himself a pelaton sponsorship in Europe
3/1/24, 8:19 am - James: https://youtu.be/yh0wT1uM3Gk?feature=shared
3/1/24, 8:22 am - James: https://youtu.be/rgpRlNxQ3HM?feature=shared
3/1/24, 8:32 am - Dave: Klopp more worried about picking up checks from iPad bike company than winning trophies
3/1/24, 8:38 am - James: It's all about klipp
3/1/24, 8:38 am - James: The pelaton ad is on UK TV each day. Makes me sick
3/1/24, 8:42 am - Jono: There’s clear contact lol
3/1/24, 8:43 am - Jono: Pen isn’t given if he doesn’t go down
3/1/24, 8:43 am - James: Tiny bit of contact means foul?
3/1/24, 8:43 am - James: He stepped two times before deciding to fall
3/1/24, 8:43 am - James: If any bit of contact means foul then the game is gone
3/1/24, 8:43 am - James: If that was at the other end you wouldn't being saying pen
3/1/24, 8:43 am - James: And klip would have gone insane
3/1/24, 8:45 am - Dave: It did happen the other end. Except Longstaff was actually clipped lol
3/1/24, 8:47 am - Jono: Was enough to slow him down. Clear pen.
As was Longstaff’s but wasn’t given.
3/1/24, 8:48 am - Dave: Good trolling ser
3/1/24, 8:49 am - Jono: The better team won at the end of the day. Newtle are still shit and Jimmity can go back to his box
3/1/24, 8:50 am - Jono: Jan / Early Feb will likely see us relinquish the lead to City looking at the games
3/1/24, 8:51 am - Jono: Though we’ll be likely above or close enough to arse and Villa to finish 2nd
3/1/24, 8:51 am - James: @14244893404 God he's loud this season. Perhaps next month we'll see the sulking and it'll be quiet in here again...
3/1/24, 8:52 am - Gerrard: I'm running out of rattle gifs for Jimmity
3/1/24, 8:53 am - James: Had to cheat to get the win against a 'shit club' 😬
3/1/24, 8:54 am - James: I missed that at the time but doesn't surprise me. Happens every week with that scum
3/1/24, 8:54 am - Gerrard: I don't think you need the ' '
3/1/24, 8:55 am - Jono: was gonna say…
3/1/24, 8:55 am - Jono: Even Tripps wants out
3/1/24, 8:55 am - James: You Varpool fans are so over reactive to anything
3/1/24, 8:56 am - James: It's like listening to those YouTube spastics Jez likes to post in here lol
3/1/24, 8:56 am - James: Jez was saying Jono was a nerd who over reacts to everything in the Liverpool Boyz chat
3/1/24, 8:57 am - James: Can you not keep that wank in there and not post it in here please?
3/1/24, 8:58 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 he's gone full chick mode
3/1/24, 8:58 am - Gerrard: 🪇
3/1/24, 8:58 am - James: Did you say that though?
3/1/24, 8:59 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 he's tried this before
3/1/24, 8:59 am - James: I don't think Jez is a nice person
3/1/24, 8:59 am - Gerrard: 🪇
3/1/24, 8:59 am - James: Toxic
3/1/24, 9:00 am - Jono: No offence taken. I do overreact to everything coz most of what is said here is pure wank 🤣 I’m also a self proclaimed football nerd
3/1/24, 9:01 am - James: Jez is so toxic
3/1/24, 9:01 am - James: Most of what is said is wank I agree. It's good you admit to your faults
3/1/24, 9:08 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Bob and I are well adjusted friends that often express our feelings on what we love about each other and what we hate about each, that's what bro love is lad.
3/1/24, 9:08 am - Jono: Gez is a good cunt
3/1/24, 9:08 am - James: Don't talk to me about him when we are having dinner then you toxic lad you
3/1/24, 9:08 am - Gerrard: Think you need to take a good hard look at yourself in your box's mirror
3/1/24, 9:08 am - Jono: Cunts can be great
3/1/24, 9:09 am - Jono: He doesn’t talk to me about you at our dinners. Unmemorable, clearly.
3/1/24, 9:10 am - James: I hope he doesn't!
3/1/24, 9:10 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 I had burst Jimmity's bubble, he thought his Livo sledging was really triggering the group - I told him it's doing nothing to most of us, maybe some post might get to you.
3/1/24, 9:11 am - Jono: It’s funny how he has private dinners though with each of us.
3/1/24, 9:11 am - Gerrard: *posts
3/1/24, 9:11 am - Jono: Nuh this chat is only funny to me
3/1/24, 9:11 am - Jono: Not triggering at all
3/1/24, 9:11 am - Jono: Even the nonsense
3/1/24, 9:11 am - James: I don't remember any of that. All I remember is uncalled for Jono sledging and you wishing my cancer was more serious
3/1/24, 9:12 am - Gerrard: Last point was slightly right, I said I wished the scar didn't heal so good so that you had a penis nose
3/1/24, 9:13 am - Gerrard: "Dick nose"
3/1/24, 9:13 am - James: You can still call me that if it makes you feel better
3/1/24, 9:13 am - Gerrard: Thanks 👍
3/1/24, 9:14 am - James: Happy new year ❤️
3/1/24, 9:14 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/ToYt5SgGDgI?si=SjI5oSJFYzTn7l8w

3/1/24, 10:28 am - Jono: Que?
3/1/24, 10:28 am - Jono: Did you win the community shield recently?
3/1/24, 10:29 am - Gerrard: Does that count?
3/1/24, 10:32 am - James: Probably have a 3210 in a draw somewhere. Bet it still works
3/1/24, 10:33 am - James: Dreamcast on the front of a football shirt

3/1/24, 7:54 pm - Jono: And they still lost 🤣
3/1/24, 7:56 pm - James: Not even remotely the same as Diaz stepping on botmans boot and Jota flinging himself to the floor two days after being brushed by the 'keeper 😂
3/1/24, 7:56 pm - James: Varpool fans 🤣
3/1/24, 7:57 pm - Jono: You keep convincing yourself that 😘

3/1/24, 7:58 pm - Jono: Top of the league
3/1/24, 7:58 pm - Jono: 😘

3/1/24, 10:01 pm - James: Should go silent after the next four weeks ⏳
3/1/24, 10:03 pm - James: @14244893404 jezbian still wanking over Nuni for some reason. Think he's posting his stats of 14 goals in 50 games
3/1/24, 10:03 pm - James: No. 9 Nooni. £85m
3/1/24, 10:03 pm - Gerrard: I don't open Jimmity's links, could be hackers from Saudi
3/1/24, 10:04 pm - James: The irony is lost on Jezzy when it comes to Saudi owned things
3/1/24, 10:04 pm - James: @14244893404 @61478754484 I hope Jezzy is one of the woke guys named in epstiens list
3/1/24, 10:05 pm - James: 'an Australian fella who thinks he a scouser profusely sweated on me'
3/1/24, 10:07 pm - James: Jezzy you still searching for 18 year olds on tinder or you upped the age yet?
3/1/24, 10:13 pm - Dave: Racist
3/1/24, 10:14 pm - Dave: “Come on lad, youse bend over lad, Farkin oath that was good lad”

4/1/24, 10:46 am - Gerrard: Rattle City, population Jimmity, 🪇
4/1/24, 10:48 am - James: Nooni might go down as the worst Varpool no.9 ever?
4/1/24, 10:55 am - Jono: Thankfully your ladder position in football is not determined by your no 9s goal tally hey
4/1/24, 10:56 am - Jono: But I’m cool as long as it gets your dick wet Jimny
4/1/24, 11:01 am - James: What if he ends up costing you the league...
4/1/24, 11:01 am - James: 'ladder position' 🤣
4/1/24, 11:17 am - Dave: Time to put his big boy pants on for rest of the season now salah is gone
4/1/24, 11:18 am - Dave: Got to show why he’s worth 100m
4/1/24, 11:20 am - Dave: Going to need all the help they can get now the best winger in the world and best defensive mid in the world have left on internationals 🥶
4/1/24, 11:21 am - Gerrard: Love the Endo love ❤️
4/1/24, 11:38 am - Jono: Peter Ly lookalike

4/1/24, 11:40 pm - Pero: Once they put that pyramid money on the table he'll reconsider
4/1/24, 11:43 pm - Dave: Behave
5/1/24, 12:07 am - Gerrard: Alien money
5/1/24, 12:07 am - Gerrard: Pot kettle
5/1/24, 12:20 am - Dave: What are Liverpool going to offer him then? He’s already on 400k a week and 32
5/1/24, 12:21 am - Dave: Think FSG are going to sanction a higher salary than that. Remember they told Klopp to fuck off when he wanted to offer Milner another 4 year extension at 38
5/1/24, 12:23 am - Gerrard: Love
5/1/24, 12:24 am - Gerrard: I don't remember
5/1/24, 12:24 am - Dave: Your man is done. Off to Saudi
Arabia for a mil a week, golden handshake 🤝 👋🏼

5/1/24, 5:34 am - Dave: What ploy?
5/1/24, 5:34 am - Gerrard: Could've easily got a laugh prompting those replies with a good lead in message
5/1/24, 5:35 am - Dave: I’m so confused. Not very sharp today, baby kept me up last couple of nights
5/1/24, 5:35 am - Gerrard: Ok ok
5/1/24, 5:35 am - Gerrard: What game is on Sunday?
5/1/24, 5:35 am - Gerrard: The cup?
5/1/24, 5:43 am - Jono: Arsenal 3-0 
We don’t give a shit about this one
5/1/24, 5:43 am - Gerrard: 5-3 Liverpool extra time
5/1/24, 5:55 am - Gerrard: Has fa cup gone to extra instead of replays yet?
5/1/24, 5:55 am - Jono: Still replay
5/1/24, 5:55 am - Jono: That’s why I say fuck it
5/1/24, 5:55 am - Gerrard: This fa or carobou
5/1/24, 5:55 am - Gerrard: ?
5/1/24, 5:56 am - Jono: FA
5/1/24, 5:56 am - Jono: We have Fulham in the other one over 2 legs
5/1/24, 5:56 am - Gerrard: Like Newty's chances of winning anything
5/1/24, 5:56 am - Gerrard: Ah yeah, remember now
5/1/24, 5:58 am - Gerrard: Just for a second, what if Sunderland wins?
5/1/24, 5:58 am - Gerrard: Biggest team in Newty?
5/1/24, 5:59 am - Jono: Imagine
5/1/24, 5:59 am - Gerrard: Some say they already are
5/1/24, 5:59 am - Jono: The scenes
5/1/24, 5:59 am - Gerrard: In here?
5/1/24, 6:01 am - Jono: Here there everywhere
5/1/24, 6:02 am - Jono: Remember this
5/1/24, 6:02 am - Jono: The Paolo knee slide
5/1/24, 6:02 am - Jono: What a man
5/1/24, 6:03 am - Jono: The love tap he gave the ref that time… and the ref back pedalled as if he got hit by a missile
5/1/24, 6:54 am - Jono: The ref should’ve been shot dead for this
5/1/24, 8:05 am - Dave: Filthy lies
5/1/24, 8:16 am - James: 'we don't care' yeeeh buddy
5/1/24, 8:16 am - Dave: Weren’t they ripping us last year for “focusing on the league”?
5/1/24, 8:17 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 8:17 am - James: They said it's not elite mentality
5/1/24, 8:17 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 8:17 am - James: When they don't win the league it'll be 'we can't compete with citeh'
5/1/24, 8:18 am - Dave: What’s klopp got to focus on? City will win the league so that leaves FA cup and Europa. Better be taking them seriously if they want a trophy this season
5/1/24, 8:18 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 8:18 am - James: No Salah no party. 3-0 varsenal
5/1/24, 8:19 am - Dave: Liverpool fans be acting like fa cup is below them. They’ll be begging for an FA cup after 1-2 months of no Salah, Endo and slob on your knob
5/1/24, 8:19 am - James: @14244893404 Salah might stay when FSG offer him £1m a week and an 8 year deal
5/1/24, 8:19 am - Gerrard: I said 5-3 Livo
5/1/24, 8:20 am - Gerrard: Arsenal are rattled almost as bad as Jimmity
5/1/24, 8:20 am - James: The 'lad' is active @14244893404
5/1/24, 8:20 am - Gerrard: Talkin bout yourself again
5/1/24, 8:20 am - Gerrard: Morning coffee and shit on Liverpool
5/1/24, 8:21 am - Gerrard: Breakfast of bottom half teams
5/1/24, 8:21 am - James: Fair weather fans @14244893404
5/1/24, 8:22 am - James: @14244893404 this time last year they weren't talking to us?
5/1/24, 8:22 am - James: Chat closed down didn't it
5/1/24, 8:22 am - Gerrard: It was like a Utopia
5/1/24, 8:22 am - Dave: FSG be like “you’re 32, how’s about this lad, we’ll drop your salary to 80k a week, 1 year contract, but Klopp will give you extra hugs and we’ll build a statue of you at Anfield, enough to tempt you away from Saudi Mo?”
5/1/24, 8:23 am - Dave: In mourning
5/1/24, 8:23 am - James: Because they were 8th
5/1/24, 8:23 am - James: You'll never walk alone
5/1/24, 8:23 am - Gerrard: To be fair it was all good until we let Jimmity Smits back in
5/1/24, 8:23 am - James: @14244893404 they wanted klopp out
5/1/24, 8:24 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 and @61478754484 pure gentlemen
5/1/24, 8:24 am - Dave: I woke up Erin snorting when I listened to this you’ll be pleased to hear
5/1/24, 8:24 am - Gerrard: Respectable lads
5/1/24, 8:24 am - Gerrard: Lol brilliant
5/1/24, 8:25 am - Gerrard: What time is it there?
5/1/24, 8:26 am - Dave: If we play like we did against Fulham, you lot will go in dry against us on Sunday
5/1/24, 8:26 am - Gerrard: Lol
5/1/24, 8:26 am - Dave: 11:30
5/1/24, 8:26 am - James: No they won't
5/1/24, 8:26 am - Gerrard: Probably be another good game like the last
5/1/24, 8:26 am - Gerrard: Proper teams competing
5/1/24, 8:27 am - James: Another good game Jez won't watch
5/1/24, 8:27 am - Gerrard: Unlike someone's team we all know 🫣
5/1/24, 8:27 am - Dave: Still got jota, Diaz and Nunez up top. Dangerous front 3 even without Salah
5/1/24, 8:27 am - James: Nunez stop trolling 😂
5/1/24, 8:28 am - Gerrard: I'd rather get Gakpo on then ol'mississippi
5/1/24, 8:28 am - Dave: Like I’ve said before about Nunez, he may be a donkey at finishing but he’s a terror for defences
5/1/24, 8:28 am - James: Dangerous for the fans sitting behind the goal
5/1/24, 8:28 am - Gerrard: Like that special kid during the play ground match
5/1/24, 8:29 am - Gerrard: Go cause a ruckus
5/1/24, 8:29 am - Gerrard: Newty couldn't handle him
5/1/24, 8:29 am - Dave: Rapid and strong and makes some great runs. Right handful. If anything he serves as a good distraction for the real forwards to score
5/1/24, 8:29 am - Gerrard: Poor Doobravka
5/1/24, 8:29 am - Dave: Brace o’ clock
5/1/24, 8:30 am - James: £85m gets you a retard up top these days
5/1/24, 8:30 am - Gerrard: Yeah as long as he keeps passing instead of shooting 👌🏻 🤣
5/1/24, 8:30 am - Dave: Prime Buffon against you boys last week
5/1/24, 8:30 am - Dave: Great “passion” though
5/1/24, 8:30 am - Gerrard: Had to walk it around him in the end, luckily their defence let us
5/1/24, 8:30 am - James: Mexicans init
5/1/24, 8:30 am - Dave: 100m of pure liability and “passion” <This message was edited>

5/1/24, 10:31 pm - Dave: Gerrard’s legacy
5/1/24, 10:40 pm - Gerrard: It's nice to think Newty's never had a player that could match up to how great Gerrard was
5/1/24, 10:41 pm - Gerrard: Love that we both sent this 🥰

6/1/24, 1:54 pm - Dave: Slob Endo and Salah. Some vital names missing, will be interesting to see how they adapt. 

Is Klopp after all, sure he has a plan.. like praying and wishing the lads national teams get knocked out in the group stages or something right..

7/1/24, 10:39 am - Dave: And there were 3 Arsenal fans in the room other than me and we all burst out laughing
7/1/24, 10:39 am - James: Take aside the fact you have as much chance of winning the league as they do (0%) and you're in the CL and they're in a competition they've been playing their reserves in 😂

7/1/24, 7:27 pm - James: @14244893404 klopp fist pumping in your backyard
7/1/24, 7:27 pm - Jono: If I cared more about the FA cup I would be happier. Honest. 

Dont know if this helps prove we might be okay without Mo but for now I’ll take that as the positive from this one. <This message was edited>
7/1/24, 7:30 pm - James: Kiwior scored a banging header what you on about?

7/1/24, 8:08 pm - James: Diisssgrace
7/1/24, 8:09 pm - James: @14244893404 didn't we say Gabriel Jesus was wank when you all started cumming when you signed him last summer?
7/1/24, 8:09 pm - Jono: They were gonna unlock him too
7/1/24, 8:10 pm - James: @14244893404 I saw loads of posts in the summer from arsenal fans going on about mikels tactics and how every team in the prem will suffer. What happened with the inverted full backs thing?
7/1/24, 8:11 pm - James: Must have lost the keys
7/1/24, 8:11 pm - James: Bobby Clarke class lad
7/1/24, 8:12 pm - Jono: Trossard’s worked out well hey
7/1/24, 8:12 pm - Jono: Bloke was BHA’s star and he leaves to warm a bench with Ramy
7/1/24, 8:15 pm - James: Arteta logic buying a keeper they didn't need and not a striker that they did need
7/1/24, 8:15 pm - James: Rammers played well tbf. Great pass and save
7/1/24, 8:15 pm - James: Deserved better
7/1/24, 8:15 pm - Jono: 🥶

7/1/24, 11:40 pm - Dave: We had everything other than goals today. Throw a decent finisher or two in the mixer and we’ll be unstoppable
7/1/24, 11:41 pm - Gerrard: Be fair bro, it's been so long since their last win
7/1/24, 11:41 pm - Jono: And non-leaky defence <This message was edited>
7/1/24, 11:41 pm - Gerrard: *Bookmarked for when you get a new striker and it still doesn't fix everything.
7/1/24, 11:42 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 Liverpool need a proper finisher and we're still top 🤷🏼‍♂️
7/1/24, 11:42 pm - Dave: Will be artetaout then
7/1/24, 11:42 pm - Dave: 😂😂
7/1/24, 11:43 pm - Gerrard: 🤣
7/1/24, 11:45 pm - Dave: Should have buried you in first half. I’m legitimately embarrassed. Fulham and hammers were a bigger challenge than that Liverpool side today and we still managed to fuck it
7/1/24, 11:45 pm - Gerrard: Wow, sly sledge there
7/1/24, 11:45 pm - Dave: Arteta looks out of ideas to get those lads scoring as well
7/1/24, 11:46 pm - Dave: Not a sledge. You were shit today
7/1/24, 11:46 pm - Dave: Didn’t have your first team
7/1/24, 11:46 pm - Dave: And we still lost, at home. It’s embarrassing
7/1/24, 11:46 pm - Gerrard: Wow, 2-0 win when shit...... NOT BHED
7/1/24, 11:48 pm - Gerrard: The greatest gift Arteta ever gave me, me being right about him not being the guy who'll save Arsenal.
How did he know my favourite thing?
7/1/24, 11:49 pm - Jono: Innit

7/1/24, 11:51 pm - Gerrard: ❤️
7/1/24, 11:53 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 @61404060785 I love how our teams played each other, one lost, and still the most toxic posts in here are from the Newtle supporter.
7/1/24, 11:54 pm - Jono: Irrelevance can do crazy things
7/1/24, 11:56 pm - Jono: Watched the highlights (the FA Cup channel ones)
We hit the bar 3 times. Not clear to me this complete domination of us was fact or not.
7/1/24, 11:57 pm - Jono: Happy to accept if that’s what justifies the Arse thinking they’re ‘close’ to world domination
8/1/24, 12:02 am - Pero: Fuck it when you're in a rut you're in a rut . Livo did enough to get through the next round we need to do more
8/1/24, 12:03 am - Pero: Livo, man city, Tottenham were all in ruts recently and have bounced back. Gunners  in rut now and need more light bulbs from the boss #artetaINneedsimprovementquick

8/1/24, 12:05 am - Pero: Sign bamford lol
8/1/24, 12:08 am - Dave: I’ll level with you, you bounced back pretty hard in the second and deserved the win. I’m more referring to the first half when I’m moaning and bitching that we should have finished you. 

Watch the first half and it was total Arsenal domination, so many chances. Game should have been over there. But I guess this is the story of our season now, reminds me of Wenger ball in his final years, tons of chances with beautiful possession based ball but no one getting it into the back of the net
8/1/24, 12:12 am - Pero: The wenger days when we were losing games with 75% possession so many times
8/1/24, 12:13 am - Gerrard: #notaretatasfault
8/1/24, 12:14 am - Gerrard: Bleach = better footballer

8/1/24, 11:24 pm - Jono: Was yesterday morning actually 😅
8/1/24, 11:31 pm - Gerrard: Whoa, there's no attack - we're just annexing the Rhineland
8/1/24, 11:32 pm - Pero: You sound like Israel 'we just defending ourselves'
8/1/24, 11:34 pm - Gerrard: It was always ours
8/1/24, 11:39 pm - Pero: That's what Israel said

Just for the intro, cringe but worth it for Arsenal fans
9/1/24, 5:25 am - Gerrard: @61478754484 Don Robbie is proper 🪇🪇🪇
9/1/24, 5:27 am - Dave: He’s not anything. All a facade for clicks on his YouTube and all the rival fans lap it up and make him richer. Such a plastic
9/1/24, 5:27 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 is this what we sounded like I'm 22/23 season?
9/1/24, 5:27 am - Gerrard: "we're just not firing"
9/1/24, 5:27 am - Dave: No
9/1/24, 5:27 am - Dave: You were awful the first 2/3 of that season
9/1/24, 5:27 am - Gerrard: "not a crisis"
9/1/24, 5:28 am - Gerrard: Us fans not the players
9/1/24, 5:28 am - Dave: We’re not awful. We’re dominating most games, we just aren’t getting it into the back of the net
9/1/24, 5:28 am - Gerrard: Arsenal are much worse than Livo 22/23
9/1/24, 5:28 am - Dave: Your defence was a sieve and you were getting battered every other week
9/1/24, 5:28 am - Gerrard: Oh you've gone full Don Robbie....
9/1/24, 5:28 am - Dave: Behave lol
9/1/24, 5:28 am - Gerrard: Don't recall this

9/1/24, 5:37 am - Gerrard: He reacts to every superchat lol
9/1/24, 5:38 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 I see Don Robbie as your no.1 Arsenal fan that represents all Arsenal fans with his voice
9/1/24, 5:40 am - Dave: Of course you do, and rightly so. 

Like Jonathon Morley and Pedo Pete Boc championing your fanbase ❤️

9/1/24, 8:24 am - Gerrard: I'm afraid of Havertz playing against Liverpool in Feb @14244893404
9/1/24, 8:25 am - Gerrard: Swap Havertz with Nunez and see if this post has legs
9/1/24, 8:25 am - Dave: To be fair, the lad was one on one with alisson a number of times. Just lacking confidence to shoot
9/1/24, 8:26 am - Gerrard: Shame it was Alisson
9/1/24, 8:26 am - James: Because he was dressed as a storm trooper?
9/1/24, 8:27 am - Gerrard: Bravo
9/1/24, 8:56 am - Gerrard: Did Mac ask the ref 'what the fuck is this?' then signalling to Saka?
9/1/24, 8:58 am - James: Lot of play acting has got into Saka's game this season

New .EXE release!!!
9/1/24, 9:59 am - Jono: Unlocked
9/1/24, 10:30 am - James: Ahahahaha 😭
9/1/24, 10:31 am - Gerrard: You're lucky no one cares about Newtle enough to make one of these vids
9/1/24, 10:32 am - James: I'd still appreciate the humour and the quality of the video if it is as well edited as this was
9/1/24, 10:34 am - Pero: Obsessed
9/1/24, 10:36 am - James: Roy got a point at citeh and Palace are all about low block counter attacking. Eze and Olise on the flanks...
9/1/24, 10:37 am - Gerrard: No space in behind for Sack or Martin, the Oddyguard got no where to pass to.....
9/1/24, 10:39 am - James: Just push Odegaard out wide. He has no right foot at all
9/1/24, 10:39 am - James: Saka might dive and win a pen
9/1/24, 10:42 am - Pero: Not out, but will be interesting to see how the formation and strategy will be
9/1/24, 10:43 am - Pero: The boss has a good couple weeks to find a solution so let's see what comes
9/1/24, 10:45 am - Pero: Pass back to rice to have a crack from 18 yards
9/1/24, 10:47 am - Jono: I’ve drawn the red line through the Gooners hey. Unless they spend big in Jan. Let’s see if Artita has a plan B
9/1/24, 10:48 am - Jono: I’m more confident in Klopp finding a plan B without Mo than Arse with their squad in tact
9/1/24, 10:49 am - Jono: And without Mr Hungary Eyes
9/1/24, 10:49 am - Jono: Not sure how long he’s out
9/1/24, 10:51 am - Jono: The hilarity of journos persisting with putting RM and LFC in the same bucket of likely Mbappe destinations is not lost on me in the last few weeks
9/1/24, 10:51 am - Jono: It has also unfortunately caused minor wood. I can’t help it. Fucking journos
9/1/24, 10:52 am - James: I'm still waiting for Bellingham to join 'livo'. @61409710717 is his dad still at that BBQ?
9/1/24, 10:59 am - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣 @14244893404 @61404060785  he's so rattled he's bring up Bellingham 🤣🤣🤣
9/1/24, 11:00 am - James: @14244893404, Jono has drawn a line through Varsenal this season its over mate sorry
9/1/24, 11:01 am - James: Or was it his mum? Can't remember who you said it was 🤔

9/1/24, 9:27 pm - Dave: Exactly
9/1/24, 9:28 pm - Dave: Just heard Trent is out as well. So slob, Trent, mo, Robbo, Tsmikas and Endo goneski? 😬

9/1/24, 9:32 pm - James: POTY slobby!? 😳
9/1/24, 9:32 pm - Dave: Slobby doneski
9/1/24, 9:33 pm - Dave: Hamstring unfortunately
9/1/24, 9:33 pm - James: Aww there goes his POTY award

9/1/24, 11:10 pm - Dave: No way that can’t be right
9/1/24, 11:12 pm - James: Varpool have spent hundreds of millions on their squad under klopp. A third of Newcastle's squad are from the championship in 2017 😬
9/1/24, 11:13 pm - James: He looked decent in three games at the start of the season and the two Varpool clowns in here started wanking each other off over him. Typical varpool fans
9/1/24, 11:15 pm - Gerrard: 🪇🪇🪇 @14244893404 struck a nerve
9/1/24, 11:15 pm - James: Tbf he's only three goals behind £85m no.9 nunei 😳
9/1/24, 11:22 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 get up Tonali's stats 🤣
9/1/24, 11:26 pm - James: Already has 1 goal less in only ten games 😬
9/1/24, 11:27 pm - Dave: That’s actually dog shit. I had a Liverpool fan mate tell me he’s world class on Saturday
9/1/24, 11:27 pm - James: Don't remember saying Tonali would be the premier league player of the season either 😂
9/1/24, 11:28 pm - James: No, in Varpool land, all Varpool players are world class atm Rodders
9/1/24, 11:28 pm - James: Endo is better than Bellingham
9/1/24, 11:29 pm - James: Pretty sure they said slobo was better than Bellingham too
9/1/24, 11:29 pm - Dave: Endo is better than all worlds best CDM combined I heard
9/1/24, 11:30 pm - James: They didn't need belling jams anyways because Trent is second to KDB in terms of midfield players
9/1/24, 11:30 pm - Gerrard: Don't remember saying any of that, are you having a 🪇 induced stroke?
9/1/24, 11:31 pm - Gerrard: Is this week 3 of one big rattle job?
9/1/24, 11:32 pm - James: Odegaard worst season > Slibos best season?
9/1/24, 11:33 pm - James: 2 assists playing behind Salah. Milner would get more. Should have let klip give him that 6 year contract
9/1/24, 11:39 pm - James: How much did sloppywank cost them!?!
9/1/24, 11:40 pm - Dave: 100? Or was that Nunez?
9/1/24, 11:40 pm - Dave: 70m
9/1/24, 11:41 pm - Dave: 35m a goal
9/1/24, 11:41 pm - James: POTY
9/1/24, 11:44 pm - James: Calvert Lewin's best at posing with handbags and dressing up like a girl and he's still better than no.9 nooni
9/1/24, 11:49 pm - Gerrard: Rattle city in here today, the PL app player comparison function getting a workout today lads
9/1/24, 11:49 pm - James: It's actually an insult to Carroll calling Nooni 'Mexican Carroll'
9/1/24, 11:51 pm - Gerrard: Jimmity can't read stats 🤣
9/1/24, 11:53 pm - James: Oh sorry, I should have said Nooni is way better than Carroll
9/1/24, 11:58 pm - Dave: Not a good day for Liverpool
9/1/24, 11:59 pm - Dave: Trent de bruyne injured
9/1/24, 11:59 pm - Dave: Club hero mane a nonce

9/1/24, 11:59 pm - Gerrard: Sky is falling

10/1/24, 5:46 am - Dave: Just listen to them
10/1/24, 5:48 am - Dave: Jokers
10/1/24, 5:50 am - Gerrard: I agree, Arteta may not be the manager to get Arsenal to a league or CL but no reason to sack him until there's a proper manager available and keen on the job.
10/1/24, 6:47 am - Dave: Based upon what? He’s lost 3 league games in a row and suddenly rival fans are all calling for his head. If we finish below top 4 after all that financial backing then there should be a conversation, sure. But fuck me, the state of these YouTubers is embarrassing
10/1/24, 6:48 am - Gerrard: .....I agreed with you
10/1/24, 6:48 am - Gerrard: How's that chip on your shoulder bro
10/1/24, 7:01 am - Dave: Been a long week. Might be time to go AWOL until we start winning again

10/1/24, 9:45 pm - James: Varpool struggling this first half hey
10/1/24, 9:45 pm - James: Weird how that happens when you have injuries init
10/1/24, 9:46 pm - James: Klip is seething on the touchline
10/1/24, 9:48 pm - Gerrard: Jimmity is a Livo fan now, watching every second of every game
10/1/24, 9:50 pm - James: Varpool looking leggy
10/1/24, 9:50 pm - James: Weird that init
10/1/24, 9:50 pm - James: Go Fulham!
10/1/24, 9:51 pm - Gerrard: Love that you talk before the end of games
10/1/24, 9:52 pm - James: Love how you wank yourselves silly halfway through a season
10/1/24, 9:52 pm - James: Classic
10/1/24, 9:53 pm - James: You've only played a few games with injuries as well 😂
10/1/24, 9:53 pm - James: Try 11 games in 32 days with the same starting 11 and no subs...
10/1/24, 9:55 pm - James: Don't worry jezzykins, you'll cheat your way back into it second half no doubt
10/1/24, 9:56 pm - Gerrard: This rattle job has gone on so long that it's become a rattled persona
10/1/24, 9:56 pm - Gerrard: The effort you put into it is troubling
10/1/24, 9:57 pm - James: Dick Van Dyke with some cracking defensive work up against 38 year old Willian there
10/1/24, 9:57 pm - James: Funny, I wake up and have a quick glance of this wank chat and think the exact same about you too 😬
10/1/24, 9:58 pm - Gerrard: Truly a spectacle to witness each day
10/1/24, 10:00 pm - James: If this first half Varpool show up at Bournemouth this weekend it might be the Dominic Solanke show
10/1/24, 10:00 pm - Gerrard: And if that shite first half against Arsenal last game is anything to go by.....
10/1/24, 10:01 pm - James: Varsenal are shit though
10/1/24, 10:01 pm - Gerrard: Ah ok
10/1/24, 10:01 pm - Gerrard: Forgot
10/1/24, 10:01 pm - Dave: We should have been up 5-0 in that first half
10/1/24, 10:01 pm - Dave: Let me guess, Liverpool don’t care about energy cup
10/1/24, 10:01 pm - Dave: “Focusing on the league”
10/1/24, 10:01 pm - Gerrard: You should've won the league last year....
10/1/24, 10:02 pm - Dave: “Played the kids”
10/1/24, 10:02 pm - Gerrard: Being a real team, I believe Liverpool want to win every comp they're in
10/1/24, 10:02 pm - James: Thought Varpoo hit the bar 5 times?
10/1/24, 10:03 pm - Dave: Look like you so rightly point out every week @61409710717. Liverpool always go one down first and then win the game in the last minute of added time
10/1/24, 10:03 pm - Dave: So you’ll be fine
10/1/24, 10:03 pm - Gerrard: I don't know what to believe any more
10/1/24, 10:03 pm - Gerrard: 75mins I said
10/1/24, 10:03 pm - Gerrard: Namaste
10/1/24, 10:03 pm - James: Ohh 12 mins added on time or a penalty?
10/1/24, 10:03 pm - Dave: Must have missed 4 of those. And that was second half when we had a meltdown
10/1/24, 10:04 pm - James: Ye not sure what game that happened in
10/1/24, 10:04 pm - Gerrard: I don't know what's real anymore with Jimmity posting alternate facts in here each day
10/1/24, 10:04 pm - Dave: Usually the added added time after VAR wasn’t able to turn a blind eye enough times during the normal 90 mins
10/1/24, 10:04 pm - Dave: Wheres your voice note. Missed it today
10/1/24, 10:04 pm - Gerrard: David, I'm hurt by your angle here
10/1/24, 10:04 pm - James: Ya klapp has been going mental so reckon the ref will bottle it
10/1/24, 10:05 pm - Gerrard: Jimmity didn't message when he woke up
10/1/24, 10:05 pm - Dave: Can we backtrack it
10/1/24, 10:05 pm - Gerrard: Usually 6pm here last night
10/1/24, 10:05 pm - Gerrard: I'm in the office now
10/1/24, 10:06 pm - James: Klip should use his pelaton on the touchline to help burn off some of that excessive energy
10/1/24, 10:06 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 now he's bringing ad endorsements into it
10/1/24, 10:06 pm - Gerrard: It's just madness in here
10/1/24, 10:07 pm - James: Anfield is so loud
10/1/24, 10:07 pm - James: What a crowd
10/1/24, 10:08 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 now he's got the decibel meter out
10/1/24, 10:09 pm - Gerrard: I don't know what's relevant anynore
10/1/24, 10:29 pm - Gerrard: Darn it, I was wrong
10/1/24, 10:29 pm - Jono: lol
10/1/24, 10:29 pm - Gerrard: 70mins
10/1/24, 10:30 pm - Gerrard: Not 75mins
10/1/24, 10:30 pm - James: My God @14244893404
10/1/24, 10:30 pm - Gerrard: @61404060785 is that Poonez increasing his G/A stats?
10/1/24, 10:30 pm - James: How did Varsenal lose to this absolute wank
10/1/24, 10:31 pm - Gerrard: Love the new angle Jimmity, nice shift
10/1/24, 10:31 pm - Jono: Stop embarrassing yourself Jim
10/1/24, 10:31 pm - Gerrard: Mate, he's well beyond embarrassing himself
10/1/24, 10:31 pm - James: Fulham could have buried it on three occasions
10/1/24, 10:32 pm - Gerrard: He's gotta sing when he can, even if it's 5mins into a Livo game
10/1/24, 10:32 pm - Jono: Could shoulda woulda
10/1/24, 10:32 pm - Jono: Definitely okay with him giving it the biggen given the current state of Newtle
10/1/24, 10:33 pm - James: I love the pattern how it's so silent (like anfield) until Varpool are ahead
10/1/24, 10:33 pm - Gerrard: I've been talking all morning
10/1/24, 10:33 pm - Gerrard: @61404060785 has learnt what you haven't Jimmity, don't talk too soon
10/1/24, 10:33 pm - James: Usually skip through your name when I see it
10/1/24, 10:34 pm - Jono: I’d have stayed quiet if you didn’t cream over Fulham this morgen
10/1/24, 10:34 pm - Gerrard: Wunderbar
10/1/24, 10:34 pm - James: Unless it's 20 games into a season
10/1/24, 10:35 pm - Gerrard: Because teams that are top after 20 games aren't worth worrying about?
10/1/24, 10:35 pm - Jono: Just scrolling up to see some of the Jimmity content
10/1/24, 10:36 pm - Gerrard: @61404060785 @14244893404 I can't keep up with all of Jimmity's rules anymore
10/1/24, 10:36 pm - Gerrard: I missed this one, wot a knob
10/1/24, 10:36 pm - Jono: That’s one of his best
10/1/24, 10:36 pm - Jono: Which takes a lot of effort
10/1/24, 10:38 pm - Jono: Jimmity will trawl thru twitter now to find the clip of a potential varpool scandal
10/1/24, 10:38 pm - Jono: And find that angle
10/1/24, 10:38 pm - Jono: To stay relevant
10/1/24, 10:38 pm - James: Haha ya'll so rattled 🎊
10/1/24, 10:39 pm - Gerrard: @61404060785 ooooooo a new Jimmity angle, we're actually the ones who are rattled
10/1/24, 10:40 pm - Jono: Reminds me of the flags during their ucl conquest
10/1/24, 10:43 pm - Dave: 2-1 omg 😂
10/1/24, 10:43 pm - Dave: I watched ten mins and it was a Fulham pump fest
10/1/24, 10:43 pm - Dave: This must be Klopp’s new tactics
10/1/24, 10:43 pm - Dave: “Tire them out”

Like Homer Simpson where he lets Mike Tyson batter him until he’s knackered then pushes him over
10/1/24, 10:43 pm - Jono: “Wait for Jimmity ejaculation, then pounce”
10/1/24, 10:45 pm - Gerrard: Not new
10/1/24, 10:47 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 I still remember you giving it the biggun when Liverpool were playing West Ham in 2021 and then they scored two late and in injury time
10/1/24, 10:48 pm - Jono: To be honest I should’ve kept quiet today as well even after going 2-1 up. But I couldn’t resist after some of the Newtle injury list excuse violin playing earlier on
10/1/24, 10:48 pm - Gerrard: Fuck it, yolo
10/1/24, 10:49 pm - Gerrard: Jimmity's standard
10/1/24, 10:49 pm - Jono: Conor Bradley is 🔥
10/1/24, 10:51 pm - James: Lucky deflection aided by Fulham fucking up three counter attacks
10/1/24, 10:52 pm - James: Team full of asthmatics getting their usual puff at HT
10/1/24, 10:55 pm - James: 2-1 noice and tight for craven cottage. Let's hope no Varpool fans kill each other or any of the cottagers if they lose 🙏
10/1/24, 11:03 pm - James: Mexican Heskey
10/1/24, 11:10 pm - Dave: He’s realised if he can’t score, he should kick it to someone who can
10/1/24, 11:13 pm - Dave: Nunez is 100m James Milner @61452662705
11/1/24, 12:04 am - Dave: They should create a new xG formula for Darwin because he never scored. Just flatline it at 0
11/1/24, 12:05 am - Dave: Does be score goals? If not, no, we couldn’t use him
11/1/24, 12:49 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1KbmbqoB85/?igsh=MWt4ZjY3djN5ZDk4aw==
11/1/24, 12:51 am - Jono: Him and Jimmity should start a pod
11/1/24, 1:06 am - Jono: Chief football writer at BBC lol
11/1/24, 1:08 am - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/shorts/5hdH6XvC_Eg?si=_iqtMPLZhRgTHRr_
11/1/24, 1:34 am - Jono: 🤐
11/1/24, 1:35 am - Gerrard: Main group post
11/1/24, 1:36 am - Gerrard: Thought you posted on the Livo chat lol
11/1/24, 1:37 am - Jono: It’s a pretty funny stat
11/1/24, 5:29 am - Gerrard: Huge handball by Fulham before the goals
11/1/24, 5:32 am - Gerrard: Mate, Jota Jones Gakpo Nunez involved in everything good for Liverpool
11/1/24, 5:32 am - Gerrard: Leno great saves of Nunez
11/1/24, 5:33 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/4SrHKXxdI0k?si=W4_xkUojDz1Ppqaa
11/1/24, 5:36 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 didn't see any of the Fulham 1st half dominance Jimmity was mentioning, 1st half was 3mins of the 11min highlights
11/1/24, 5:55 am - Gerrard: Jesus all your blokes are delusional
11/1/24, 5:56 am - Dave: What’s everyone thinking then? 

Mine:

Alisson 

Zinny
Gabriel
Saliba
Trent 

Rice
Odegaard
Gravenbirch

Salah 
Nunez 
Martinelli
11/1/24, 5:57 am - Gerrard: You're fucking delusional 🤣
11/1/24, 5:57 am - Dave: Who do you disagree with?
11/1/24, 5:57 am - Gerrard: I disagree with YOU
11/1/24, 5:58 am - Gerrard: Why do you waste your time on these things?
You have a child to look after
11/1/24, 5:58 am - Dave: You not taken your tabs today lad?
11/1/24, 5:59 am - Gerrard: Lol that one hurt?
11/1/24, 5:59 am - Gerrard: Stung at least?
11/1/24, 6:03 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1J_cxzosXg/?igsh=MWYyMmpqM290a2w2Nw==
11/1/24, 6:14 am - Dave: Not in the slightest ❤️
11/1/24, 7:00 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C18sSXRupjl/?igsh=MWw1ZWxxeGI3ajQwMw==
11/1/24, 7:01 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 have you see Arsenal win a trophy in your lifetime?
11/1/24, 8:24 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0wVKCZtgJK/?igsh=MTJjcTlvNmp3em9wag==
Racist English I say
11/1/24, 10:57 am - James: Looooserrrr
11/1/24, 10:58 am - Jono: Was thinking the same. Jimmity nonsense once again
11/1/24, 10:58 am - James: Gravenbirch 😂
11/1/24, 11:01 am - Jono: I 2nd this
11/1/24, 11:01 am - James: The one shot where he managed to hit the keeper from three yards out?
11/1/24, 11:01 am - Jono: Before next weekend’s game please
11/1/24, 11:02 am - Jono: The header was pretty good. Decent save
11/1/24, 11:02 am - Jono: Nunez played well. Made a big difference once he and Gapko came on
11/1/24, 11:03 am - James: I don't like solanke
11/1/24, 11:03 am - Jono: He’s a poor man’s Isak
11/1/24, 11:03 am - Jono: Interesting move
11/1/24, 11:03 am - Jono: Good enough form to cause us problems though next week so please just sign the cunt
11/1/24, 11:03 am - James: Has Eddie Howe took the English filter off his player search
11/1/24, 11:05 am - Jono: VVD for either of those cunts
11/1/24, 11:05 am - James: Howe signed him for Bournemouth
11/1/24, 11:06 am - James: Probably something in it. May have a release clause
11/1/24, 11:06 am - James: Gabriel
11/1/24, 11:07 am - James: Saliba is too good for Varsenal. He's the only player they have that could go to a bigger club like citeh or real
11/1/24, 11:07 am - Jono: Which one got out jumped by Jota the jockey the other day
11/1/24, 11:08 am - Jono: How embarrassing
11/1/24, 11:08 am - James: Jota is deceptively good in the air
11/1/24, 11:08 am - Jono: He’s a foot shorter than both those giraffes!
11/1/24, 11:08 am - James: True
11/1/24, 11:10 am - Jono: Gravenbach has a lazy streak in him.

Macca is starting to prove why he’s a WC winner hey. Jack of all trades through the middle. I’d have him over Robyn (because Odeegard looks like that dyke singer)
11/1/24, 11:11 am - James: Odegaard has one foot
11/1/24, 11:11 am - James: He's the Almiron of centre midfield
11/1/24, 11:11 am - Jono: Good player
11/1/24, 11:11 am - Jono: Not great though
11/1/24, 11:12 am - James: It's why real got rid
11/1/24, 11:12 am - Jono: Finally we agree on something Jimmity
11/1/24, 11:12 am - Jono: Rice will slowly take over as captain
11/1/24, 11:13 am - Jono: Like Bruno did over Madge
11/1/24, 11:13 am - Jono: Not that Bruno is any better than Madge
11/1/24, 11:14 am - Jono: Ode can’t be captain long term if they’re serious about winning a title
11/1/24, 11:14 am - James: Odegaard is the type of captain that will try gee up the away supporters
11/1/24, 11:19 am - Jono: Makes sense considering Artita wants him
11/1/24, 1:00 pm - Dave: Was actually trying to appear more neutral. I’d take Havertz over him.
11/1/24, 1:07 pm - Dave: How is VVD is still getting all the credit for Liverpools “strong defence”. Alisson is the only reason Liverpools GA isn’t about double what it should be, truly elite gk
11/1/24, 1:09 pm - Dave: Agree
11/1/24, 1:56 pm - Dave: “Very close” but still so far! Alisson has faced 25 more shots than Raya has this season so far. Rare Goldbridge L
11/1/24, 4:29 pm - James: Youtuber says this so must be true
11/1/24, 7:50 pm - James: Click click click
11/1/24, 7:50 pm - James: https://x.com/NUFC/status/1745461311083835411?s=08
11/1/24, 7:50 pm - James: Didn't say that at all 😢
11/1/24, 7:51 pm - James: FFP is hilarious BTW. Brought in to protect the already established
11/1/24, 7:52 pm - Jono: Must’ve been the Italian Gamblor that got you in the black
11/1/24, 7:53 pm - James: Jez said something similar, as in used the world Gamblor. What the fuck is a Gamblor? Is that an Australian word for legend?
11/1/24, 7:54 pm - James: https://x.com/078Yasser/status/1745230562271355329?s=08

11/1/24, 7:54 pm - James: This vid came up on twitter earlier thought I'd share it again. So good. Best vid of 2023 by far
11/1/24, 7:57 pm - Jono: Ah nice. Knockout UCL stage content.
11/1/24, 7:58 pm - James: *Annihilation UCL stage content
11/1/24, 8:01 pm - Jono: The drone knew
11/1/24, 8:05 pm - James: Excellent means we have money
11/1/24, 8:06 pm - James: Can't wait to see the uproar when we sell Almiron and Wilson to Al Ittihad in the summer for £50m. PIF ❤️
11/1/24, 8:06 pm - Jono: Got my blacks and reds mixed up. Like me on a roulette table 😅
11/1/24, 8:08 pm - James: Most clubs operate at losses as long as you don't exceed £105m per year. And unless you are Man City or PSG. You can do what you like then
11/1/24, 8:30 pm - Gerrard: This never happened

12/1/24, 3:42 am - Gerrard: SORRY!!! I looked at the table, apologies
12/1/24, 5:26 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 this reaching for stats is below you
12/1/24, 5:34 am - Dave: Surprised you even see my messages in the see of anti-arsenal propaganda you post in here
12/1/24, 5:35 am - Gerrard: whoa what anri arsenal posts?
12/1/24, 5:35 am - Gerrard: *anti
12/1/24, 8:23 am - Pero: What bombing in gaza ?
12/1/24, 9:05 am - James: Must be for Kane
12/1/24, 9:08 am - Pero: Weird
12/1/24, 10:09 am - Gerrard: Absolute madness
12/1/24, 10:09 am - Gerrard: Did he even start for Tottenham?
12/1/24, 10:20 am - Jono: He won a penalty shootout for England
12/1/24, 10:20 am - Jono: That’s enough to earn a knighthood
12/1/24, 10:36 am - James: Where's slobywank?
12/1/24, 11:38 am - Gerrard: He mean a higher level?
12/1/24, 12:10 pm - James: Solanke hatty next week then 🤌

13/1/24, 1:54 am - Gerrard: Now that would be the icing on the cake of this season
13/1/24, 2:08 am - Dave: What did he say? I don’t have ten minutes to watch some anti-arsenal propaganda
13/1/24, 2:27 am - Gerrard: It's from an arsenal fan, not anti
13/1/24, 2:29 am - Dave: Quote?
13/1/24, 2:36 am - Gerrard: Arteta said he knew they wouldn't be able to repeat this season the scoring from last season, and still didn't buy a striker over the offseason
13/1/24, 2:42 am - Gerrard: Pretty accusing of negligence after signing a shitty mid and new keeper when they needed a striker
13/1/24, 2:42 am - Gerrard: *pretty much accusing
13/1/24, 2:43 am - Jono: https://www.footballtransfers.com/en/transfer-news/uk-premier-league/2024/01/newcastle-transfer-news-bruno-guimaraes-release-clause-jacque-talbot
13/1/24, 2:45 am - Jono: I can understand why they bought Rice. Typical English club creaming over an overhyped local player to replace their very capable international club and country captain <This message was edited>
13/1/24, 2:46 am - Jono: That’s not a swipe at Arsenal but at the whole league in general
13/1/24, 2:47 am - Jono: Buying a keeper though instead of a proven goal scorer though was a deeeesgrace
13/1/24, 6:23 am - Dave: Wow. We were all saying we needed a striker last season as well, was pretty obvious. But to be fair, martinelli, odegaard and saka were banging goals in for fun last season
13/1/24, 6:26 am - Dave: I disagree, I don’t think Rice is overrated. I thought he’d flop when Arsenal were in negotiations to buy him. He’s fucking incredible though. No bias, I’d be the first to crucify him if I thought he was a dud.

Although I agree that we made a massive mistake letting xhaka go
13/1/24, 7:17 am - Gerrard: .....cool
13/1/24, 8:06 am - Dave: You’re shit
13/1/24, 8:30 am - Pero: Totally agree rodwell , Rice is a machine 💪💪it'll be good to see what happens when partey comes back in a couple weeks and see how they go together
13/1/24, 8:31 am - Pero: Looks like arsenal is being pretty active with looking for a striker in this window 🤞
13/1/24, 8:40 am - Gerrard: What a surprise AFTV fans agreeing with each other
13/1/24, 9:00 am - Pero: We speak the truth

@14244893404 @61422023136
13/1/24, 7:06 pm - Dave: Wish we’d signed Isak, what a player
13/1/24, 7:13 pm - James: Nunez is better lol
13/1/24, 7:13 pm - James: Gordon with a banger as well
13/1/24, 7:13 pm - Jono: Obsessed
13/1/24, 7:14 pm - Jono: Good game this
13/1/24, 7:14 pm - Jono: Happy for Newtle to win
13/1/24, 7:14 pm - Jono: Given they’re 16 points behind
13/1/24, 7:16 pm - James: Still far too much space in midfield
13/1/24, 7:24 pm - James: Great game so far
13/1/24, 7:57 pm - Dave: City wearing Newty down. Hope they can get the result
13/1/24, 8:27 pm - Jono: Fuck City
13/1/24, 8:28 pm - Dave: And this is why city are winning the league again. Fuck me
13/1/24, 8:28 pm - Dave: Unlucky jimmity. Great game
13/1/24, 8:28 pm - James: KDB is ridiculous
13/1/24, 8:28 pm - James: You can't defend him
13/1/24, 8:28 pm - Jono: Would like a replay of this handball they’ve cleared
13/1/24, 8:29 pm - Jono: Knowing what’s happened in past seasons
13/1/24, 8:29 pm - James: Done it all himself
13/1/24, 8:31 pm - James: Offered nothing second half. Can't change it up from the bench. It's a joke
13/1/24, 8:43 pm - Jono: Newtle crumbling at home with a lead. Seen that before.
13/1/24, 8:43 pm - James: Obsessed
13/1/24, 8:43 pm - Jono: Thanks for getting my dick wet for nothing, cunts
13/1/24, 8:44 pm - James: It's so cute you think Varpool have any chance of winning the league
13/1/24, 8:44 pm - Jono: Better than having no chance I guess
13/1/24, 8:44 pm - James: At least Varsenal fans accept it
13/1/24, 8:44 pm - James: That's what you have. Zero
13/1/24, 8:45 pm - Jono: Another closet City lover

14/1/24, 12:30 am - Liam: Fucking hell Trippier is shit!
14/1/24, 12:32 am - Dave: Liverpool fans talking about “their title charge” while calling Arsenal fans delusional. The slip up is going to be glorious
14/1/24, 12:40 am - Gerrard: Wow, where's this coming from?
14/1/24, 12:40 am - Jono: The only title charge references I can see here are from @14244893404 and @61452662705
14/1/24, 12:40 am - Jono: You fruit loops
14/1/24, 12:42 am - Jono: Either suggesting arse were innit or making your own narrative up that LFC are
14/1/24, 12:43 am - Gerrard: Trippsey a liability at RB, maybe he should play CM or RW
14/1/24, 12:45 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 aren't Chelsea and United in a crisis?
14/1/24, 12:46 am - Gerrard: I gotta say, I hate seeing City win but I love seeing Newtle be who they'll always be.
14/1/24, 12:50 am - Gerrard: My boy has got the receipts, you English bastards
14/1/24, 12:52 am - Dave: Anyone want to see mine?
14/1/24, 12:52 am - Gerrard: Sure
14/1/24, 12:52 am - Gerrard: Can't be from outside the group chat ya English dog
14/1/24, 12:53 am - Gerrard: Also post right now or we'll know you've Photoshopped it
14/1/24, 12:54 am - Gerrard: David Mr.Photoshop Rodwell
14/1/24, 12:55 am - Dave: Bad signal. They’re coming through title challengers jez and jono
14/1/24, 12:55 am - Gerrard: Lol that's pathetic, Englishman
14/1/24, 12:55 am - Gerrard: Colonizer logic
14/1/24, 12:55 am - Dave: I just pulled a select recent few out of the “Liverpool are title challengers” wank brigade
14/1/24, 12:56 am - Gerrard: Sometimes I forget you're English then there's times like this
14/1/24, 12:56 am - Dave: Racist
14/1/24, 12:57 am - Gerrard: You can't be racist to your own oppressor, that's the rules
14/1/24, 12:57 am - Jono: Charge and challenge are two different words
14/1/24, 12:58 am - Gerrard: Don't be mad at us because Arsenal's bottle came early this year, it's not our fault
14/1/24, 12:58 am - Gerrard: It's Arteta's fault
14/1/24, 12:58 am - Gerrard: Be mad at him
14/1/24, 1:19 am - Gerrard: https://www.youtube.com/live/4sL2YTUqUpY?si=tCoWKxkGZEA70wOO
I recommend fast forwarding to all the goal times
14/1/24, 1:31 am - Dave: Who are you oppressed by? Grew up in one of the wealthiest, youngest nations in the world with opportunities galore
14/1/24, 1:32 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 he's gone off topic like a chick that knows they're wrong
14/1/24, 1:43 am - Gerrard: All good, top player
14/1/24, 1:43 am - Gerrard: Good haircut
14/1/24, 1:44 am - Dave: Is there a chance? 😍 https://x.com/eduardohagn/status/1746237352958165117?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
14/1/24, 1:45 am - Gerrard: I think Issac deserves to play for a proper team, won't be too long before a CL team liberates him
14/1/24, 1:52 am - Jono: Straight from Gezcuts

14/1/24, 7:42 am - Gerrard: Does Chelsea think the minimum fee for a player is 100m?
14/1/24, 10:14 am - Jono: Another Saudi flop
14/1/24, 10:17 am - James: Execute him
14/1/24, 10:37 am - Jono: They sacked Nuno
14/1/24, 10:37 am - Jono: Coz he wanted him sacked
14/1/24, 10:38 am - Jono: That backfired 😅
14/1/24, 10:45 am - James: Zero. You don't have £120m
14/1/24, 10:45 am - James: Wonder how much Gordon is worth now
14/1/24, 10:47 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 how you going mate?
Welfare check innit.
14/1/24, 10:48 am - James: Was going to ask you the same having witnessed kdb's return
14/1/24, 10:48 am - James: Still challengers?
14/1/24, 10:51 am - Gerrard: Why would KDB returning affect Liverpool fans?
14/1/24, 10:52 am - James: Because you're only two pts ahead of a KDB - less citeh and now he's back?
14/1/24, 10:52 am - James: You're challengers aren't you?
14/1/24, 10:53 am - James: Isn't that what Rodwell just proved above with all those saucy receipts
14/1/24, 10:53 am - Gerrard: Just gotta live one game at a time and keep winning.
14/1/24, 10:53 am - Gerrard: Liverpool are the next team after City likely to win it.
14/1/24, 10:53 am - James: Mad how klipp gets away with that mentality from you but cryteta doesn't
14/1/24, 10:53 am - Gerrard: Thought that was a given.
14/1/24, 10:54 am - Gerrard: The what?
14/1/24, 10:54 am - Gerrard: You gotta start making more sense when you talk, now that your team and fell off
14/1/24, 10:54 am - James: Surely he has to win the league?
14/1/24, 10:54 am - Gerrard: Who?
14/1/24, 10:54 am - James: Or is it, we can't compete with citeh so coming second is great
14/1/24, 10:55 am - Gerrard: I would love to win the PL
14/1/24, 10:55 am - Gerrard: Definitely can, but it's a tough ol' league
14/1/24, 10:55 am - James: If pep doesn't win the league it's a failure but if klip or cry don't it's acceptable these days <This message was edited>
14/1/24, 10:56 am - Gerrard: You think that?
14/1/24, 10:57 am - Gerrard: I think it's always City's league to lose because of their situation.
Takes a big effort from another team to win it these days.
14/1/24, 10:57 am - James: The competitive nature of the league and what is acceptable has fallen dramatically
14/1/24, 10:57 am - Gerrard: Top 4 is hard for some too
14/1/24, 10:57 am - Gerrard: Top half is hard for others
14/1/24, 10:58 am - James: Both varsenpool have spent a lot of money as well
14/1/24, 10:58 am - Gerrard: What a silly statement
14/1/24, 10:58 am - Gerrard: You're such a silly sod
14/1/24, 10:59 am - James: Didn't Varsenal spend over £200m in the summer
14/1/24, 11:00 am - Gerrard: I don't know about Arsenal finances
14/1/24, 11:00 am - James: Why is it always Citehs to lose then?
14/1/24, 11:00 am - James: I don't think their team is miles ahead squad wise of varsenpools <This message was edited>
14/1/24, 11:02 am - James: Hence why it's acceptable to fail to win the league for varsenpool but it isn't for citeh
14/1/24, 11:02 am - James: Pep would get daggers but kliptetta wouldn't
14/1/24, 11:11 am - Jono: No one cares about Citeh
14/1/24, 11:12 am - Jono: He wouldn’t get daggers coz no one actually cares
14/1/24, 11:14 am - Jono: https://www.football365.com/news/transfers-premier-league-five-year-net-spend-man-utd-man-city 

Spend and net spend are different things Jimmity
14/1/24, 11:14 am - Gerrard: Did you just start following football when Newty got bought? <This message was edited>
14/1/24, 11:15 am - Jono: You’ve got a case for Arsenal and more importantly, your team as well based on this data
14/1/24, 11:15 am - Jono: Newtle higher net spend than Citeh
14/1/24, 11:15 am - Jono: Over the last 5 seasons
14/1/24, 11:19 am - Jono: How nuts is that
14/1/24, 11:24 am - Jono: Who did we buy that season @61409710717 ?
14/1/24, 11:25 am - Jono: Shaqiri? lol
14/1/24, 11:25 am - Jono: And people still want to convince me Klopp is a fraud
14/1/24, 11:25 am - Gerrard: Heavens now
14/1/24, 11:26 am - James: You know Newcastle's net spend was £3m each season for 20 years under Ashley
14/1/24, 11:27 am - James: We had nothing to sell so had to spend
14/1/24, 11:27 am - Gerrard: Jimmity you're breaking your own rules again..... Looking at the past
14/1/24, 11:27 am - James: You only ever seem content on cherry picking stats that suit your wank narratives
14/1/24, 11:27 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 this guy is a serial rule breaker
14/1/24, 11:28 am - Gerrard: He must be reprimanded
14/1/24, 11:28 am - James: Cry like a bunch of bitches that citeh bought the league when your cunt club did the exact same in the 80s
14/1/24, 11:28 am - Gerrard: WHOA the language
14/1/24, 11:28 am - Jono: If you’re gonna go back that far, let’s talk about Citeh then
14/1/24, 11:28 am - Gerrard: Snookered
14/1/24, 11:28 am - James: Citeh should be able to spend
14/1/24, 11:29 am - James: FFP is bunk. It closed the door for everyone else
14/1/24, 11:29 am - Jono: You made the argument it’s a level playing field
14/1/24, 11:30 am - Jono: And that Citeh are fair game with us all
14/1/24, 11:30 am - Jono: I’m confused
14/1/24, 11:31 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 Yo come check this out, @61404060785 is SMOKIN' Jimmity
14/1/24, 11:31 am - James: Only thing Jono smokes is your cock
14/1/24, 11:31 am - Jono: Now you’re bitching about FFP. No idea what you’re trying to say.
14/1/24, 11:31 am - James: You should be grateful tbf
14/1/24, 11:32 am - James: Haven't Varsenal also spent near 1b since cryteta took over?
14/1/24, 11:33 am - Gerrard: Whoa homophobic too, going for gold tonight
14/1/24, 11:33 am - James: The narrative is why is it a failure for pep to not win the league but it isn't for klipy
14/1/24, 11:34 am - Jono: As I said, you have some plausibility for them based on their net spend compared to others incl Citeh but yeah you’re smoking crack if you think LFC are on the same level
14/1/24, 11:34 am - Gerrard: It's just common logic bro
14/1/24, 11:34 am - James: You've purchased the leagues most expensive player in each of the main positions haven't you not
14/1/24, 11:34 am - Gerrard: You been eating too much cheese in France, got cheese madness
14/1/24, 11:34 am - James: Excluding midfield because Cacido rejected you
14/1/24, 11:35 am - Jono: We only spend based on what we sell - I dunno man. I’m just stating facts
14/1/24, 11:35 am - James: Perhaps if you were more savvy and not wanked £100m on a shit striker you could have strengthened your midfield last season lol
14/1/24, 11:36 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 is he taking about that guy with a killer G/A record since joining Liverpool?
14/1/24, 11:36 am - Gerrard: The guy who fucked Jimmity in his arsehole?
14/1/24, 11:36 am - James: What!?
14/1/24, 11:37 am - Jono: You keep digging yourself up there when it’s the same guy who started the downfall of Newtle this season. All was looking rosy up until that point
14/1/24, 11:37 am - Jono: Now there’s no cock long enough to dangle down to 10th for you to nibble on
14/1/24, 11:37 am - James: You are now saying he's a gun because he scored against Newcastle 😂
14/1/24, 11:37 am - Gerrard: Yeah Jimmity you did say Newty was going to be awesome this year and go deep in the CL
14/1/24, 11:38 am - Gerrard: So not sure if you've got any credibility left
14/1/24, 11:40 am - James: Can you post all your transfers and net spend that you guys send to each other in your livo boys chat so I can take a look
14/1/24, 11:40 am - James: The 'coutinho' money one please
14/1/24, 11:40 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 can't even remember how long ago we messaged in the other chat, I thought this was the Livo chat
14/1/24, 11:41 am - Jono: You seem certain of this so I’ll let you find the data @61452662705
14/1/24, 11:41 am - James: Varpool the only club that doesn't spend money
14/1/24, 11:42 am - Jono: Oh we spend
14/1/24, 11:42 am - Jono: But we sell too
14/1/24, 11:42 am - Gerrard: Newty will be doing this soon too
14/1/24, 11:42 am - Jono: They’ll have to sell one of their stars just to keep the gamblor
14/1/24, 11:43 am - James: Good job we have a country we can eventually sell players to
14/1/24, 11:44 am - James: Until your owners try and put a stop to it
14/1/24, 11:44 am - James: But didn't mind selling their own players to in the summer
14/1/24, 11:45 am - James: Weird
14/1/24, 11:45 am - Jono: Given the rate of players coming back from Saudi I’m sure that won’t be as commonplace as you think.
14/1/24, 11:46 am - Gerrard: Fuck I can't make any sense of any of Jimmity's messages
14/1/24, 11:47 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2E9wMNA4D_/?igsh=c29weGxvMGd2MGU4
14/1/24, 11:47 am - James: If Jonny hadn't finished in your eyes then perhaps you would be able to
14/1/24, 11:47 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 🪇
14/1/24, 11:48 am - Jono: 10th

Enough said

14/1/24, 11:50 am - James: Varpool 9th highest in world football, Citeh 16th 😳
14/1/24, 11:50 am - James: Since FFP
14/1/24, 11:50 am - Gerrard: Lol @61404060785 he's digging now
14/1/24, 11:50 am - Gerrard: 🪇
14/1/24, 11:51 am - James: But it's OK for Varpool to only have one title in 30 years and klopp is amazing. But Varpool can't compete with citeh because citeh spend money...
14/1/24, 11:51 am - James: Ouch
14/1/24, 11:51 am - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣 @61404060785 'Ouch'
14/1/24, 11:52 am - James: Jono what's doing a 69er like with Jez? Do you make him dress up like klopp. Fake beard and all?
14/1/24, 11:52 am - Jono: And glasses
14/1/24, 11:53 am - James: Get him a peloton and go full throttle
14/1/24, 11:56 am - Jono: Still find it hilarious that you consider Klopp a flop
14/1/24, 11:58 am - James: No, the narrative that klip or arteta not being able to win the league because they're up against citeh is what my point was
14/1/24, 11:59 am - James: And that if citeh don't win it, they've failed. If kliptetta doesn't win it, it is not a failure
14/1/24, 11:59 am - Gerrard: Going off topic again
14/1/24, 12:00 pm - Jono: What makes you think if pep doesn’t win it he failed
14/1/24, 12:00 pm - James: That is the expectation is it not
14/1/24, 12:00 pm - Gerrard: Hey if anyone knows about failing, Newtle box boi
14/1/24, 12:01 pm - James: Jono do you have psychedelic cum or something. Jez is struggling here
14/1/24, 12:02 pm - James: https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67671051
14/1/24, 12:03 pm - Jono: That’s his words
14/1/24, 12:22 pm - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2Cb14ap8uO/?igsh=aG40Y3l4OWxpeTV3
14/1/24, 1:46 pm - James: Noncy still better than Isak @61409710717?
14/1/24, 1:46 pm - James: Would you swap the two if you could?
14/1/24, 1:47 pm - James: @14244893404...
14/1/24, 2:13 pm - Gerrard: Don't need rat cheating fucks in my team
14/1/24, 2:19 pm - James: Going up always
14/1/24, 2:20 pm - James: Woah
14/1/24, 2:20 pm - James: I asked about Isak
14/1/24, 7:33 pm - Dave: On what planet is he worth 120m lol
14/1/24, 7:34 pm - James: How much is he worth in your eyes then considering how much strikers go for
14/1/24, 7:34 pm - Dave: 60/70m. Good business for you boys
14/1/24, 7:34 pm - James: He is the fifth most valuable striker in the world
14/1/24, 7:34 pm - James: What we signed him for 😂
14/1/24, 7:34 pm - Dave: You paid 40 didn’t you?
14/1/24, 7:34 pm - James: You're also hamstrung with ffp btw
14/1/24, 7:35 pm - James: £63m
14/1/24, 7:35 pm - Dave: Need to offload Eddie and Jesus
14/1/24, 7:35 pm - James: Isak is same value as Jesus apparently
14/1/24, 7:35 pm - James: Though he's twice the player
14/1/24, 7:35 pm - Dave: He’s a different type of player
14/1/24, 7:36 pm - James: To who
14/1/24, 7:36 pm - James: Who is going to buy nketiah
14/1/24, 7:38 pm - Dave: Think west ham want him
14/1/24, 7:38 pm - Dave: Couple of other clubs interested
14/1/24, 7:38 pm - Dave: Not sure why
14/1/24, 7:38 pm - Dave: He only turns up twice a year
14/1/24, 7:39 pm - James: They can have Wilson
14/1/24, 7:39 pm - James: And play him up top with his besty Antonio
14/1/24, 7:39 pm - Dave: Not sure why either. Think it’s just the anti arsenal agenda
14/1/24, 7:40 pm - James: It's totally fine when klip fails
14/1/24, 7:40 pm - James: I miss Jose. He'd call him a specialist in failure
14/1/24, 7:41 pm - Dave: https://graphroots.co.uk/2021/01/23/why-net-spend-is-lazy-analysis-player-amortisation/
14/1/24, 7:44 pm - James: Yes. He only needs one chance and he scores
14/1/24, 7:44 pm - Dave: “Look at how well he’s doing on a shoe string budget” 

After dropping 100m on a striker, 70m on a midfielder, 80m on a defender, 70m on a keeper and 40m a pop on the rest of the squad
14/1/24, 7:44 pm - James: Neither Jesus or Isak are nunez level though
14/1/24, 7:44 pm - James: I made this point earlier
14/1/24, 7:45 pm - James: They have a bench they can bring on £200m worth of players still even with injuries
14/1/24, 7:45 pm - Dave: Net spend over 10 years is the first thing Liverpool fans scramble to. I wish Arteta had the luxury of inheriting a £160m player
14/1/24, 7:45 pm - James: But what klip is doing is a miracle
14/1/24, 7:46 pm - Dave: The way Liverpool fans talk is as if Kloppety went and picked the lads up from the local park and cuddled them to elite levels
14/1/24, 7:47 pm - Dave: Salah was a waiter before Klipp discovered him and nurtured him to the best winger the prem has ever seen
14/1/24, 7:47 pm - James: They were also about to sign a £110m midfielder until he rejected them <This message was edited>
14/1/24, 7:48 pm - Dave: That caceido or bellignham?
14/1/24, 7:48 pm - James: 🤔
14/1/24, 7:48 pm - James: My other point was its OK to fail because 'citeh'
14/1/24, 7:48 pm - James: That is just bollocks
14/1/24, 7:49 pm - James: Varpool fans legit see klopp as an equal to pep
14/1/24, 7:49 pm - James: Not. A. Chance. <This message was edited>
14/1/24, 7:50 pm - Dave: If you look at our starting lineup, and you total what we paid for them in transfer fees, it’s exponentially less than what Liverpool paid
14/1/24, 7:50 pm - Dave: That’s why Liverpool fans always scramble to net spend
14/1/24, 7:51 pm - James: It would be nice to have a squad mostly built of £30-40m players
14/1/24, 7:51 pm - Dave: Arteta inherited a load of duds and toxic marquee signings, no wonder our net spend looks trash when you consider ozil, auba etc went on frees
14/1/24, 7:51 pm - Dave: Had to totally rebuild
14/1/24, 7:52 pm - James: Ditto us. £3m net spend per season under Ashley. We had nobody worth anything until the takeover
14/1/24, 7:52 pm - James: Maybe St Max was our most valuable player who we sold for £20m to Saudi
14/1/24, 7:53 pm - Dave: Ours was balogun. 35m
14/1/24, 7:54 pm - James: For such a magician, who has klopp brought through their academy. Surely they should have one of the best in the world. Trent? Maybe Curtis Jones will be good?
14/1/24, 8:03 pm - Dave: Here check this out @61452662705
14/1/24, 8:04 pm - Dave: Alisson, Van Djik, Slob and Nunez ALONE cost £320m 😂😂😂
14/1/24, 8:04 pm - James: Varpool are only in fourth because Alisson and Salah's ages drop their value and Chelsea have about 50 players on their books <This message was edited>
14/1/24, 8:05 pm - Dave: But net spend innit
14/1/24, 8:05 pm - James: Coutinho money
14/1/24, 8:06 pm - James: They should be grateful to PIF for buying their shite in the summer
14/1/24, 8:07 pm - James: Heaven forbid Newcastle get a loan from over there to help out though. Not allowed. Ban that <This message was edited>
14/1/24, 8:14 pm - James: Wonder what Dick Van Dyke etc transfer fees would be when adjusted for inflation
14/1/24, 8:14 pm - James: It was a world record for a defender wasn't it?
14/1/24, 8:21 pm - Dave: 200m
14/1/24, 8:22 pm - Dave: To be fair, he was worth it. Best defender in the world for a couple of years
14/1/24, 8:22 pm - Dave: Just doesn’t fit in with the “rags to riches” narrative Liverpool fans like to peddle
14/1/24, 8:42 pm - James: That Hojland will end up better than nooni
14/1/24, 9:14 pm - Dave: 2 in 2? Coming out his shell a bit
14/1/24, 9:21 pm - Jono: Unlocked? 🔓 lol
14/1/24, 9:27 pm - James: Top scorer in the UCL
14/1/24, 9:29 pm - James: Nooni only ever had one good season his whole career so far and that was in Portugal @14244893404
15/1/24, 12:21 am - Pero: 100% rodders! Even pepe our most expensive signing for free. Not to mention Mustafi, sokratis, bellerin, chambers, kolasinac, laccazette, mkhitayan, welbeck... all these guys exiled for free. Would be interesting to see a stat showing average spend for incoming transfers
15/1/24, 12:21 am - Gerrard: Those guys won your last trophy 🤷🏼‍♂️
15/1/24, 12:23 am - Pero: They were in the squad but not focal point for success
15/1/24, 12:26 am - Gerrard: And the two subs too
15/1/24, 12:28 am - Gerrard: Can't believe how you AFTV fans disrespect the players who last won you a trophy, then suckoff all these current mediocre players who haven't won you shit
15/1/24, 12:29 am - Pero: The clubs future and longevity, these guys weren't  the guys for that
15/1/24, 12:29 am - Gerrard: Longevity of not winning
15/1/24, 12:33 am - Dave: Look, just face it. For a manager that’s supposedly pep’s calibre and the amount of spending Liverpool have done, it’s a bit underwhelming. One title in 34 years
15/1/24, 12:33 am - Gerrard: 🤣 nice try Rodders, fish ain't biting today
15/1/24, 12:34 am - Dave: What’s bait? Anything untrue there?
15/1/24, 12:34 am - Gerrard: What's your next angle?
15/1/24, 12:34 am - Gerrard: Pivot
15/1/24, 12:34 am - Dave: Pep Klopp only won one title after buying global transfer record marquee signings in most positions
15/1/24, 12:34 am - Gerrard: Fighting like a Jimmity, changing the topic
15/1/24, 12:35 am - Dave: You’re a wannabe plastic citeh. What’s worse than an oil club? A wannabe oil club
15/1/24, 12:36 am - Pero: Rebuilds take time its a process
15/1/24, 12:36 am - Gerrard: @61422023136 @61478754484 @61410933997 @61414738121 - the only Arsenal fans I respect
15/1/24, 12:37 am - Dave: Exactly. Doesn’t happen overnight ❤️
15/1/24, 12:37 am - Dave: DIVIDE AND CONQUER
15/1/24, 12:37 am - Gerrard: No divide, they don't know or like you either
15/1/24, 12:39 am - Dave: Liam and Pero love me ❤️❤️ 

So toxic
15/1/24, 12:40 am - Gerrard: Hey I'm only speaking from what I witness, if I misread that then ok
15/1/24, 12:41 am - Gerrard: I'm sorry
15/1/24, 12:41 am - Gerrard: I just assumed with the whole being English thing
15/1/24, 12:41 am - Gerrard: Sorry
15/1/24, 2:36 am - Louie: Everton again?
15/1/24, 2:36 am - Jono: Looks like it
15/1/24, 2:36 am - Gerrard: They never learn
15/1/24, 2:37 am - Gerrard: Told you it was suss Forest spending so much
15/1/24, 2:38 am - Louie: They pretty much bought a whole new Prem level team in their first season
15/1/24, 3:08 am - Liam: This message was deleted
15/1/24, 3:09 am - Gerrard: Aww what happened
15/1/24, 4:51 am - Dave: Chelsea and city ever going to get dragged over the coals? 😂
15/1/24, 4:51 am - Gerrard: 🤷🏼‍♂️
15/1/24, 4:52 am - Gerrard: Going for the teams with actual History first <This message was edited>
15/1/24, 11:31 am - Jono: Yikes
15/1/24, 11:31 am - Jono: But because they didn’t pay 100 million for any of them I guess they’re free from any scrutiny <This message was edited>
15/1/24, 11:32 am - Gerrard: But with that 100m.....
15/1/24, 11:33 am - Gerrard: Well it's even more than that with Rice Rice Baby
15/1/24, 11:33 am - Gerrard: But you get me
15/1/24, 11:54 am - Jono: Nooni dis dat
15/1/24, 12:06 pm - Gerrard: Something something Nunez is actually good 👌🏻
15/1/24, 12:18 pm - James: I dunno. I think for £100m you'd expect goals
15/1/24, 12:19 pm - Gerrard: Arteta became Arsenal manager, then yadda yadda yadda, Arsenal didn't win the league
15/1/24, 12:20 pm - James: Varsenal aren't exempt. They don't win the league this season arteta out
15/1/24, 12:21 pm - Gerrard: Mike Ashley sold the club to the Saudis, then yadda yadda yadda, Jimmity still isn't happy
15/1/24, 12:22 pm - James: The Spanish final was in Saudi. How fucked is that
15/1/24, 12:22 pm - Gerrard: Ew
15/1/24, 12:23 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/-0kcet4aPpQ?si=rYszC16tVTWkDc5s
15/1/24, 12:23 pm - Jono: Don’t worry Newy will start taking games there soon enough
15/1/24, 12:24 pm - Gerrard: No beers or pork pies in Saudi
15/1/24, 12:24 pm - James: I expect Varpool to do the same to help offload some more deadwood
15/1/24, 12:24 pm - James: Salah farewell tour for the summer too 😍
15/1/24, 12:24 pm - Gerrard: Typical scousers swindling foreigners
15/1/24, 12:25 pm - James: They do that to each other no need to go abroad
15/1/24, 12:25 pm - Gerrard: More money abroad
15/1/24, 12:25 pm - Gerrard: Not just dole checks
15/1/24, 12:25 pm - James: More money in Somalia than Liverpool
15/1/24, 12:28 pm - Gerrard: Allah be praised
15/1/24, 12:29 pm - James: 😳 @14244893404
15/1/24, 2:07 pm - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C10zAOyub4H/?igsh=MXhjNTBlb3ViOXZpMw==
This one is killer
15/1/24, 3:34 pm - James: Four of those players haven't missed a league game yet 😂
15/1/24, 7:12 pm - Dave: Ah yes, Arsenal haven’t been on the end of any scrutiny
15/1/24, 7:12 pm - Dave: God this Liverpool downfall is going to be GLORIOUS
15/1/24, 9:27 pm - James: Ange is class
15/1/24, 9:34 pm - Dave: Fair comment 🤮 We’re off the boil and Liverpool are a ticking time bomb. Hate to say it but spurs are doing well considering injuries and Ange is elite. Spurs look convincing when they’re on the pitch, even with VAR decisions going against them every weekend
15/1/24, 9:35 pm - James: Watched them last night. Very impressive
15/1/24, 9:52 pm - Gerrard: A simmering turd
15/1/24, 9:53 pm - Jono: I remember Neville saying the Yanited glory days were coming back
15/1/24, 9:54 pm - Jono: 3 of you typing
15/1/24, 9:54 pm - James: @14244893404 imagine Ange wins spurs the league while Kane comes second behind Leverkusen
15/1/24, 9:54 pm - Jono: lol
15/1/24, 9:54 pm - Dave: Is Kane more spursy than spurs?
15/1/24, 9:54 pm - Gerrard: I remember Neville saying that Rodders wasn't delusional and Jimmity knew football.
15/1/24, 9:55 pm - James: What Ange has done so far in his first season is way more impressive than klip's first season <This message was edited>
15/1/24, 9:55 pm - James: Varpool should look at Ange in the summer
15/1/24, 9:55 pm - Dave: Klip spent a fortune
15/1/24, 9:55 pm - Dave: Was talking about this with my mate last night
15/1/24, 9:56 pm - James: Klip left Dortmund on their knees
15/1/24, 9:56 pm - James: Finished 7th in a two horse race lol
15/1/24, 9:56 pm - Dave: Totalled up how much that Liverpool starting 11 cost Klip vs our starting 11 cost Arteta and it was mind blowing. 

Yet “Arteta is recklessly spending” and should win everything this season otherwise he’s a failure
15/1/24, 9:57 pm - James: Left Mainz in a mess as well. Languishing in bundesliga 2
15/1/24, 9:57 pm - James: Got them relegated, favourites to go up the following season and failed
15/1/24, 9:57 pm - Dave: Spent 160m more on his starting 11 than arteta spent on arsenals @61452662705
15/1/24, 9:58 pm - Dave: Won one title and supposed to be on a par with Pep
15/1/24, 9:58 pm - James: I can believe that without even fact checking @14244893404
15/1/24, 9:59 pm - James: If you were a young manager and you got given the option of spending a day at a training session with pep or klopp and you could have a few hours of their time to talk tactics etc, nobody would pick klopp 😂
15/1/24, 10:00 pm - James: You want to know about football not how to hug players and yell at officials
15/1/24, 10:00 pm - Dave: Arsenals starting 11 - 370m
Liverpools starting 11 - 532m 

162m more yet Klip is the hard done by genius let down by FSG
15/1/24, 10:01 pm - James: Even that disabled Liverpool fan looked uncomfortable around klip in that Christmas vid. He had no arms so couldn't cuddle the way klopp wanted
15/1/24, 10:01 pm - James: Probably would have given whatever limbs he had spare to use that time with pep instead
15/1/24, 10:01 pm - James: Or Ange
15/1/24, 10:03 pm - Dave: “Can you sign this shirt for my kid Klip?”

“Fucking hold it still you stupid thick cunt, just forget it”
15/1/24, 10:03 pm - James: But I have no arms klopp sir
15/1/24, 10:04 pm - James: "wow, who's idea was it to wheel this flid into my office today"
15/1/24, 10:06 pm - James: "see that over there, that's a pelaton, go run on it. No wait, you can't can you. Useless boy"
15/1/24, 10:07 pm - Gerrard: I repeat, weird angles
15/1/24, 10:07 pm - James: Whys your manager such a horrible cunt mate?
15/1/24, 10:10 pm - Dave: Bit of a theme here isn’t there @61452662705
15/1/24, 10:11 pm - James: Sing or not sing? What's he asking for?
15/1/24, 10:12 pm - Dave: Not sure. Depends whether he’s Jekyll or Hyde that weekend
15/1/24, 10:16 pm - James: He might growl at them if they're not careful. Grrr
15/1/24, 10:29 pm - Pero: 😂😂 i knew he was a bit of a nutter but I didn't realise this maniac side of klopp
15/1/24, 10:39 pm - Gerrard: Don't fuck with der Kaiser
15/1/24, 10:44 pm - James: Nazi sympathiser
15/1/24, 10:56 pm - Dave: ☘️
15/1/24, 10:57 pm - Gerrard: Ireland did send condolences to German when Hitler died.
15/1/24, 10:57 pm - Gerrard: The enemy of my enemy kinda thing
15/1/24, 10:58 pm - Dave: Wow
15/1/24, 10:58 pm - James: Ya bit thick are ye old Irish
15/1/24, 10:58 pm - Gerrard: I found out last week
15/1/24, 10:58 pm - Gerrard: Then I laughed and laughed
15/1/24, 10:59 pm - James: I laugh when ever I think of the potato famine
15/1/24, 10:59 pm - James: Nearly killed them
15/1/24, 10:59 pm - Gerrard: 🪇
15/1/24, 10:59 pm - James: Death by lack of potato
15/1/24, 10:59 pm - James: Whatever shall we eat!? <This message was edited>
15/1/24, 11:00 pm - Gerrard: Nothing that why they starved
15/1/24, 11:00 pm - Gerrard: 🪇
15/1/24, 11:00 pm - Dave: Just take the soup innit
15/1/24, 11:00 pm - James: Potato is the only food
15/1/24, 11:00 pm - Gerrard: Oooooooo Rodders knows his history
15/1/24, 11:01 pm - Gerrard: Like it, like it
15/1/24, 11:01 pm - James: Healthier
15/1/24, 11:01 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 he doesn't know
15/1/24, 11:02 pm - James: Uh huh honey, I know but also don't care
15/1/24, 11:02 pm - Gerrard: Sure, sure we believe you box boi
15/1/24, 11:03 pm - James: @14244893404 Jez pretending he's Irish again <This message was edited>
15/1/24, 11:03 pm - Gerrard: Nice quick edit box boi
15/1/24, 11:03 pm - Gerrard: English your first language?
15/1/24, 11:04 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 fuck I hate to admit it....
15/1/24, 11:04 pm - Gerrard: I respect you infinitely more than box boi
15/1/24, 11:05 pm - James: What a sledge for rodwell
15/1/24, 11:05 pm - Gerrard: 🤣
15/1/24, 11:05 pm - James: Dunno how that would make me feel @14244893404
15/1/24, 11:06 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 the group chat finally not talking about Arsenal, success!
15/1/24, 11:06 pm - Dave: Mission accomplished
15/1/24, 11:20 pm - Pero: Wow really ? Didn't realise Ireland had neo nazis
15/1/24, 11:21 pm - Gerrard: Not neo nazis just fighting the oppressors, but didn't Croatia have a little neo nazi thing?
15/1/24, 11:27 pm - Pero: Yes they did. But they also claimed to be fighting the oppressors...
15/1/24, 11:29 pm - Gerrard: Zero genocides on the Irish books, only a fair few terrorist/freedom fighter bombings/assassinations
15/1/24, 11:29 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 did you know they took out a royal family member?
Saw it when I was visiting and mum was watching The Crown.
15/1/24, 11:34 pm - Pero: Aww how sweet anti genocidal terror 🥰🥰
15/1/24, 11:34 pm - Dave: No. Who? Hopefully one of the noncey ones

15/1/24, 11:45 pm - Pero: There's always kids or pram bombings involved
15/1/24, 11:45 pm - Dave: Disgusting isn’t it
15/1/24, 11:45 pm - Dave: Lowest of the low hey @61452662705

16/1/24, 12:22 am - Gerrard: 🤷🏼‍♂️ Petrinovic used to go on about

16/1/24, 10:57 pm - Jono: Unlocked Havertz should’ve won
16/1/24, 10:58 pm - Jono: Trippier was unplayable
16/1/24, 10:58 pm - Jono: Until he became unplayable
16/1/24, 11:00 pm - Dave: Slobsy? 0.05 assist per game slobsy? 4% shooting success Slobsy?
16/1/24, 11:03 pm - Jono: You wouldn’t believe this but I’ve got a couple of stats here

16/1/24, 11:25 pm - Gerrard: Talking about yourself again

17/1/24, 1:49 am - Dave: Please don’t chop my head off divine leader ❤️
17/1/24, 1:49 am - Gerrard: You talking to me or Jimmity.... you know, the whole headchopping thing
17/1/24, 5:39 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/7cpJWDU3dJM?si=wLtolyOLNhK6GpA9
Poor Howard
17/1/24, 9:58 am - Shaun: Chase the money can't handle the lifestyle
17/1/24, 9:59 am - Shaun: I remember, a long time ago, one of the A leave players went to China and then his family "couldn't settle" there
17/1/24, 9:59 am - Gerrard: Too communisty
17/1/24, 10:07 am - Pero: Is this real or photoshop ?
17/1/24, 10:07 am - Gerrard: Real
17/1/24, 10:07 am - Gerrard: I think
17/1/24, 10:08 am - Pero: Wow
17/1/24, 10:08 am - Gerrard: They all jumping ship
17/1/24, 10:08 am - Gerrard: Benezma to Chelsea talk now lol
17/1/24, 10:09 am - Pero: Apparently benz is 15m ? But fuck chelsea
17/1/24, 10:15 am - James: One shit player has left. "they're all jumping" 😂
17/1/24, 10:23 am - Gerrard: This guy never gets old
17/1/24, 6:26 pm - Dave: Still going on about this. Get over it, rules are rules it’s only a game
17/1/24, 6:27 pm - Dave: Liverlogic. World revolves around them
17/1/24, 6:27 pm - Dave: Someone was telling me he’s put on a bit of timber and looked shit in Saudi

18/1/24, 10:41 am - Pero: Cmon on over to the gunners buddy ! For 15m
18/1/24, 6:09 pm - Dave: Apparently he deferred his wages to avoid taxes then demanded to be released on a free
18/1/24, 10:14 pm - Jono: Salah injured 🤕 🤮
18/1/24, 10:14 pm - Gerrard: Injuries are no excuse
18/1/24, 10:26 pm - Dave: I’ll remember this next time you call me delusional. Don’t say I didn’t call it. 

@61452662705 title charge still on?
18/1/24, 11:20 pm - Jono: Hopefully we're made of stronger stuff than Newtle
18/1/24, 11:23 pm - Gerrard: Stronger than oil?

19/1/24, 5:36 am - Dave: Sauce? Don’t believe it for a second
19/1/24, 5:37 am - Gerrard: Greatest english midfielder ever
19/1/24, 5:37 am - Jono: https://www.tiktok.com/@buzz16_/video/7323896202875948321
19/1/24, 5:38 am - Jono: 🐎👄
19/1/24, 5:39 am - Dave: Guessing Paul scholes and lamps aren’t English then?
19/1/24, 5:42 am - Gerrard: No they are
19/1/24, 5:57 am - Dave: What about Gazza? He English?
19/1/24, 6:02 am - Gerrard: Cry baby but yes English
19/1/24, 6:03 am - Gerrard: Has Arsenal ever had a good English midfielder before Decks?
19/1/24, 6:06 am - Dave: What’s Arsenal got to do with you claiming sloppy slippy G is better than the above
19/1/24, 6:21 am - Gerrard: Jesus fuck mate, forgot I can ask honest questions in here - I'll DM you
19/1/24, 6:23 am - Gerrard: I think I better name that chip of yours if it's here to stay
19/1/24, 6:25 am - Gerrard: Reina and Alisson would've saved it
19/1/24, 6:25 am - Gerrard: That brussels cunt was living off his penalty save in his first game
19/1/24, 7:05 am - Jono: We were at cheers for that

“He’s our keeper our Belgian keeper, he’s Simon mignolaaaaaaaaay. Ah Mignolet, ah Mignolet ah Mignolet” lol
19/1/24, 8:56 am - James: Gay
19/1/24, 8:56 am - James: @14244893404 Salah went off crying apparently just like the CL final when Ramos snapped him. What a poof
19/1/24, 8:58 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 8:59 am - James: Haha thick mackem bastard
19/1/24, 1:25 pm - Gerrard: Injuries aren't an excuse
19/1/24, 6:12 pm - Dave: Oh they will be in a months time when you’re fifth
19/1/24, 11:04 pm - Dave: I would never celebrate a player getting injured, I’m not a monster 😮😱
20/1/24, 12:23 am - Gerrard: Lies
20/1/24, 12:24 am - Jono: Ajax’s intro video was hilarious
20/1/24, 12:25 am - Jono: “He wore number 14 at Liverpool (Cruyff’s number)… but he WONT be wearing that here”
20/1/24, 12:37 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/S7x-Y0HBt_w?si=iCd75xpo6CB7Hb6y
20/1/24, 1:38 am - Dave: @61452662705 “not a group of death”
20/1/24, 1:39 am - Gerrard: Truth
20/1/24, 1:39 am - Gerrard: Personally I think Howie should stay
20/1/24, 1:40 am - Dave: Rory gets it right every time. Big brain ball knowledge
20/1/24, 1:47 am - Gerrard: That motherfucker don't miss
20/1/24, 4:39 am - Dave: How wholesome https://x.com/lfckay_/status/1748413265334473165?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
20/1/24, 5:53 am - James: I don't watch these. Think Jez is the only one who does tbh. This a Jez Jennings classic?
20/1/24, 6:24 am - Dave: He said Howe is dog shit and mourinho is going to take his job. Said he predicted he’d struggle this year and he gets loads of predictions right, then proceeded to reel off all the correct predictions he’s made
20/1/24, 6:26 am - Dave: Also said your champions league group wasn’t a group of death as PSG “have a weak underbelly” and you signed Milan’s best player so you should have turned them over. 
This was all in the first 3 mins before I switched it off
20/1/24, 6:45 am - James: @14244893404 did you hear Rick Parry (Varpool) number 2 behind Richard Masters (prem leader) say 'you could replace all the teams that aren't one of the top six and it makes no difference'
20/1/24, 6:47 am - James: That's who is running the premier league and people still think there is zero bias or the 'big' clubs aren't protected at the expense of the other 14
20/1/24, 6:47 am - James: 'bad for the brand' when Leicester won remember
20/1/24, 7:33 am - Dave: Outrageous statement that
20/1/24, 7:34 am - Dave: “Bad for the brand” that Newcastle came fourth last season. That’s why the powers above are making you come fourteenth this season
20/1/24, 7:35 am - James: Wouldn't laugh yet, you might come out the top four entirely this season...
20/1/24, 7:36 am - James: Can see spurs having a stormer till the end of the season. No distractions
20/1/24, 7:37 am - James: It is strange how two new rules got made up this season and last season about sponsorships and loaning players from saudi
20/1/24, 7:38 am - James: That's four of the 'big' six doing their best to make the league anti competitive
20/1/24, 7:39 am - Jono: I thought it was because of the injuries?
20/1/24, 7:39 am - James: Not sure what any of that has to do with profit and sustainability if your club has the ability to put money in that they have
20/1/24, 7:39 am - James: Poor Everton and Forest being punished for just trying to stay in the league...
20/1/24, 7:39 am - Dave: So you think that’s why Newty are dropping down the table this season?
20/1/24, 7:39 am - Jono: Re: this
20/1/24, 7:40 am - Dave: Control
20/1/24, 7:40 am - James: No club can compete with 11 players out. Yours couldn't either
20/1/24, 7:40 am - Dave: Right
20/1/24, 7:40 am - Dave: Not 11 starters
20/1/24, 7:40 am - James: So you think not having a bench doesn't impact a team?
20/1/24, 7:41 am - James: When you cannot make a sub at all
20/1/24, 7:41 am - Dave: Tonali you can’t count, barely got a whiff. Who’s out of your starting 11?
20/1/24, 7:41 am - Jono: I cannot keep up with all jimmitys excuses
20/1/24, 7:41 am - Dave: Thought you had a pretty strong team against city
20/1/24, 7:41 am - Dave: Not trolling
20/1/24, 7:41 am - James: Barnes, Joelinton, Willock, Anderson
20/1/24, 7:41 am - James: Missed Botman three months. Burn two months
20/1/24, 7:41 am - James: Murphy
20/1/24, 7:42 am - James: If you can't make a sub then is it a surprise you can't hold on
20/1/24, 7:42 am - Dave: Willock and Anderson starters?
20/1/24, 7:42 am - James: And Tonali does impact you when you have to play a 17 year old academy player
20/1/24, 7:42 am - James: Willock starts
20/1/24, 7:42 am - Dave: So 3 total out of your starting line up
20/1/24, 7:43 am - Dave: I think you look knackered
20/1/24, 7:43 am - Dave: Lack of subs I guess
20/1/24, 7:43 am - Dave: Tripps looks like a shell of a man
20/1/24, 7:43 am - James: What world do you live in when you don't think having to play the same 11 every game with no subs doesn't impact you 😂
20/1/24, 7:44 am - James: Why we fall apart after 60 mins every game
20/1/24, 7:44 am - Dave: Just don’t think Eddie Howe prepared very well for a couple of injuries
20/1/24, 7:44 am - Dave: Rory was right
20/1/24, 7:44 am - James: I think you are a shit troll sir
20/1/24, 7:44 am - Jono changed the group name from "Title Challengers & Arsenal Fans Group Chat + Box Boi" to "Title Challengers & Arsenal Fans & Newtle Symphony Orchestra 🎻 Group Chat + Box Boi"
20/1/24, 7:44 am - Jono changed the group name from "Title Challengers & Arsenal Fans & Newtle Symphony Orchestra 🎻 Group Chat + Box Boi" to "Title Challengers & Arsenal Fans & Newtle Symphony Orchestra 🎻 Group Chat"
20/1/24, 7:44 am - James: But I'm happy to talk to you
20/1/24, 7:45 am - James: I remember when Varpool said the reason they barely made top four that season was injuries. They only had dyke out because pickford snapped him
20/1/24, 7:46 am - Jono: It’s always about us in the end
20/1/24, 7:46 am - James: Yeah it is. Glad you admit it. Finally!
20/1/24, 7:48 am - James: Yeah @14244893404 we had two sub keepers instead of the usual three to make up the bench
20/1/24, 7:49 am - James: Not one midfield or attacker except 35 year old Ritchie
20/1/24, 7:49 am - James: He was class in the championship in 2016
20/1/24, 7:51 am - James: Rory McKeown
20/1/24, 7:55 am - Jono: All roads lead to Anfield
20/1/24, 7:57 am - Jono: Just fact checking this one
20/1/24, 7:57 am - Dave: Why are you sending me your sub bench. You had a great game with your starting 11, almost upset City
20/1/24, 7:58 am - James: Disagree. Especially second half
20/1/24, 7:59 am - Jono: I’m happy for everything to come to something LFC did to justify your own behaviours but if your saying blatant lies than we need to call it out
20/1/24, 8:00 am - Jono: The symphony already sounds beautiful with the violins alone
20/1/24, 8:00 am - James: Jota, tiago, always injured
Keieta was shit
Ox never played

Henderson dyke and Fabinho only players worth a shit back then
20/1/24, 8:01 am - Jono: Don’t need the rusty trombone too
20/1/24, 8:01 am - James: So three players
20/1/24, 8:01 am - James: 7 games for Henderson in all comps is nothing
20/1/24, 8:02 am - James: And this was supposedly best team in the world back then 😂
20/1/24, 8:02 am - Jono: The king of spin
20/1/24, 8:02 am - Jono: Jimmy Warne
20/1/24, 8:02 am - Jono: Can bowl a leg break
20/1/24, 8:02 am - James: Lose your most vital players and come back to me
20/1/24, 8:04 am - James: Shall I add Karius, Manquillo, Hendrick and Hayden to my list as well 😂
20/1/24, 8:04 am - Jono: Your most vital players are Gordon and Isak. Was also Trippier though he’s turned into Jon Flano
20/1/24, 8:04 am - Jono: I’ll give you Pope at most to line up with your symphony
20/1/24, 8:04 am - James: Both injury prone and can't play every game which they are
20/1/24, 8:05 am - James: Glad for the Gordon love though. Class player
20/1/24, 8:05 am - James: I forgot Pope. Thanks
20/1/24, 8:05 am - James: That's a huge one
20/1/24, 8:19 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 can I get the short version of today's bollocks?
20/1/24, 8:19 am - Gerrard: Too much to read
20/1/24, 8:24 am - James: Rodwell went over something along the lines of you being a mug
20/1/24, 8:28 am - Gerrard: Classic Rodders
20/1/24, 8:29 am - Jono: “We make excuses coz Liverpool did too”
20/1/24, 8:30 am - James: @61409710717 Jono admitting it's all about Liverpool and that they make excuses. Landmark day really
20/1/24, 8:31 am - Gerrard: Just another day in paradise in this group chat then.
20/1/24, 8:48 am - Dave: - Newtle essentially have a full strength starting 11 but blame injuries

- There’s a conspiracy theory against Newtle to not let them back in top 6 because it’s bad for business  

- A debate is being had whether Liverpool had any meaningful injuries in 2021

- Rory Jennings is a massive clueless cunt
20/1/24, 8:48 am - Dave: That it is
20/1/24, 8:48 am - Jono: The 2nd one made me chuckle
20/1/24, 8:49 am - Jono: I saw Botman mentioned at one point
20/1/24, 8:49 am - Gerrard: Boys, I'm hearing all of this through my Google assistant while I'm driving. It's fucking hilarious to hear Jimmy. The whinging pom says this clickbait riders and Rory is a cont.
20/1/24, 8:49 am - Jono: Null and void any cred when you can get donkeyed by Noone
20/1/24, 8:49 am - Jono: Nooni*
20/1/24, 8:52 am - Gerrard: Google assistant just said you sent a picture. What is it?
20/1/24, 8:52 am - Jono: Stat that we win more without Salah
20/1/24, 8:53 am - Gerrard: I'll allow it.
20/1/24, 8:54 am - Gerrard: Kid deserves to play
20/1/24, 8:55 am - Dave: Would love to see him get a start
20/1/24, 8:55 am - James: £40m and he's gonski
20/1/24, 8:57 am - James: Think cryteata may lose his job if you finish outside top 4 @14244893404?
20/1/24, 8:58 am - James: Aftv will want his head on a platter
20/1/24, 8:59 am - James: I read he's spent over £600m since 2020
20/1/24, 9:00 am - Dave: Na. Think he’s got another couple of seasons grace regardless
20/1/24, 9:00 am - James: That true?
20/1/24, 9:00 am - James: Lol don't think so personally
20/1/24, 9:01 am - James: You're worse this season than last after spending a fortune and you've had a pretty easy ride fixture and injury wise
20/1/24, 9:01 am - Dave: Probably. Totally rebuilt the team from ground up
20/1/24, 9:01 am - James: Rebuilt a team that was already top 6?
20/1/24, 9:01 am - James: Was just underachieving under his management?
20/1/24, 9:02 am - James: Emery was better
20/1/24, 9:02 am - Gerrard: I think there's a bit of a myth to Arteta at Arsenal, the team was decent but no longer getting top 4, he came in and made them worse, then after Edu spent a lot of money they got better, then everyone said it was Arteta.
20/1/24, 9:02 am - Gerrard: Can we please discuss this without anger and bias?
20/1/24, 9:03 am - James: They bottled top 4 last two games
20/1/24, 9:03 am - James: Few years back
20/1/24, 9:03 am - James: They had a team full of great players
20/1/24, 9:03 am - James: And were finishing 8th
20/1/24, 9:03 am - James: Spent a fuck tonne under edu
20/1/24, 9:05 am - James: If Varsenal continue on this recent trajectory there's no way Lego pep will survive
20/1/24, 9:06 am - Gerrard: I do think with an Emery last year they could've won it
20/1/24, 9:06 am - James: What's happened to Martinelli this season @14244893404
20/1/24, 9:07 am - James: Where was all this 'it's a process' talk when he took over? Poor guy was ridiculed
20/1/24, 9:08 am - James: Just went on to win Villareal a euro cup and turn villa into a better team than Arsenal currently in one season
20/1/24, 9:08 am - James: Didn't spend much either
20/1/24, 9:10 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I feel like you're skimming the line of talking about this without anger and bias
20/1/24, 9:11 am - James: I just hear so much hate toward Nketiah and Jesus and wonder if it's just scapegoating
20/1/24, 9:11 am - James: Martinelli has been poor
20/1/24, 9:54 am - Jono: Juicy
20/1/24, 10:05 am - Gerrard: Games on tonight?
20/1/24, 10:06 am - Jono: 11.30
20/1/24, 10:39 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2GDTckL3Jb/?igsh=aGVpaml6cTA3Mm9z
20/1/24, 11:23 am - Pero: Let's not get too ahead of ourselevs arsenal are in a slump just like every other team has been, they can turn this around and get up the ladder in no time... lets see what happens tonight to see where their heads are at. Arteta has changed the emirates #inthe processwetrust
20/1/24, 11:23 am - Gerrard: .....oh Pero
20/1/24, 12:37 pm - Dave: The same emery that needed 3 points from 5 games to get us champions league and bottled that?
20/1/24, 12:43 pm - James: Bottling existed before and after as we all know
20/1/24, 12:43 pm - James: Fans?
20/1/24, 12:43 pm - Dave: We were 10th when Arteta took over and slipping further down the table. We were regressing under Emery
20/1/24, 12:44 pm - James: Sounds like you're making facts up to excuse arteta
20/1/24, 12:44 pm - Dave: Ahhhh the classic “you spent money”. 

Because Chelsea and United are doing so well dropping more than any of us..
20/1/24, 12:44 pm - Dave: Awful attempt lads 🧌 🧌
20/1/24, 12:45 pm - James: Yeah that way you can excuse arteta. When he's sat in the boardroom explaining poor performance he'll just say look at Chelsea and Manure
20/1/24, 12:45 pm - James: Poor defence this
20/1/24, 12:46 pm - Dave: Arteta’s our man. Going to win some trophies with him. Focus on sharpening your pitchfork for steady Eddie, already seen the Newty fans trending #howeout
20/1/24, 12:46 pm - James: What's up with marinella
20/1/24, 12:46 pm - James: ?
20/1/24, 12:46 pm - James: Howe going nowhere ❤️ and not sure what this has to do with artetwa
20/1/24, 12:48 pm - Dave: Just don’t think people should throw stones in glass houses, that’s all
20/1/24, 12:49 pm - Gerrard: Lot of messages here
20/1/24, 12:49 pm - James: Rodwell in denial
20/1/24, 12:49 pm - James: Thinks Emery is shit
20/1/24, 12:50 pm - James: Arteta saved arsenal from certain relegation had he not came in and spent a billion
20/1/24, 12:50 pm - Dave: Not shit. Clearly good manager. Just not the right fit for Arsenal
20/1/24, 12:51 pm - James: Emery will have Villa a trophy before Arteta wins one for Varsenal with his own team
20/1/24, 12:51 pm - James: Emery essentially won you a trophy tbf
20/1/24, 12:51 pm - Dave: Howe spent a shit load more than arteta in the same timeframe and you’re struggling to stay in top half. I can understand how frustrating that is and why you’re lashing out. Here if you need to talk ❤️
20/1/24, 12:52 pm - James: Not even true and coming from two complete opposites of the table. Howe performed a miracle. Arteta hasn't done anything?
20/1/24, 12:52 pm - Gerrard: I can see anything that Arteta has accomplished, if this was Klopp you guys would be murdering him for not winning anything
20/1/24, 12:53 pm - James: Don't see DT kidnapping his wife under emery
20/1/24, 12:53 pm - James: That's on arteta
20/1/24, 12:53 pm - Dave: 8th to 5th to 2nd and a few trophies. Think Arteta is doing just fine. 

What’s Howe done? We spent 300m and can’t stay in the top half trophy?
20/1/24, 12:54 pm - Gerrard: Zero trophies
20/1/24, 12:54 pm - James: Charity shield doesn't count and FA Cup was Emery
20/1/24, 12:54 pm - Gerrard: Exactly
20/1/24, 12:54 pm - Gerrard: Stop being delusion and be real for fuckssake
20/1/24, 12:54 pm - James: You didn't even warrant being in the charity shield 😂
20/1/24, 12:55 pm - James: If anything they should have let manure go in it
20/1/24, 12:55 pm - Dave: We beat a full strength city to win the charity shield. May as well have been the title. What a day ❤️
20/1/24, 12:55 pm - Gerrard: I don't understand why Arteta is getting a free pass, it's like Stockholm syndrome
20/1/24, 12:55 pm - James: Ten Hag did more than arteta and you think he's shit
20/1/24, 12:55 pm - Gerrard: You've all been tricked
20/1/24, 12:56 pm - Dave: What free pass? Took Klopp 4 years to win the title and he also inherited the premier leagues most expensive ever transfer
20/1/24, 12:56 pm - Gerrard: NOTHING HAS CHANGED, you won a few more games
20/1/24, 12:56 pm - James: Arteta second and a bottle trophy
Ten Hag third and cup and another cup final
20/1/24, 12:56 pm - Gerrard: Going off topic like a chick who knows she's in the wrong
20/1/24, 12:56 pm - James: Ten Hag > Cryteya
20/1/24, 12:56 pm - Dave: Klopp was also an established manager of ovef 20 years and regarded as one of the best
20/1/24, 12:56 pm - James: Sorry Rodders it's true
20/1/24, 12:56 pm - Dave: Arteta’s in his first managerial job
20/1/24, 12:56 pm - Dave: If you lads aren’t trolling you’re both cooked
20/1/24, 12:56 pm - Gerrard: Yeah and he's shit
20/1/24, 12:57 pm - Gerrard: Get a real manager
20/1/24, 12:57 pm - James: Yeah we can tell he's wank
20/1/24, 12:57 pm - Gerrard: You'll be better
20/1/24, 12:57 pm - Gerrard: You might even win something <This message was edited>

20/1/24, 1:00 pm - James: Underrated
20/1/24, 1:00 pm - James: That bloke at Bournemouth is very good too
20/1/24, 1:00 pm - James: De Zerbi?
20/1/24, 1:00 pm - Gerrard: Nom for moty
20/1/24, 1:01 pm - Gerrard: Yep
20/1/24, 1:01 pm - James: Potter?
20/1/24, 1:01 pm - James: He's better than chelsea

20/1/24, 1:01 pm - James: More pedigree
20/1/24, 1:01 pm - James: Luis enrique
20/1/24, 1:02 pm - Gerrard: ARTETA IS JUST A GOOD COACH, NOT A GOOD MANAGER
20/1/24, 1:02 pm - Gerrard: Hottake
20/1/24, 1:02 pm - James: Did I say alonso?
20/1/24, 1:02 pm - Gerrard: Yeah
20/1/24, 1:02 pm - James: Isn't he in his first real job
20/1/24, 1:02 pm - James: Couldn't find a player who has had the education like he has
20/1/24, 1:02 pm - Gerrard: FIRST JOB - IS A GOOD MANAGER
20/1/24, 1:03 pm - James: Managers he's worked under
20/1/24, 1:03 pm - James: Michael Carrick is looking good
20/1/24, 1:03 pm - James: Not a surprise at all
20/1/24, 1:03 pm - Gerrard: Alonso learnt from playing under Rafa Ancelotti Jose Pep, Arteta learnt by playing under Moyes and Wenger
20/1/24, 1:04 pm - James: Daaamnnn @14244893404
20/1/24, 1:04 pm - James: Arteta is basically Everton
20/1/24, 1:04 pm - James: He's a Spanish Duncan Ferguson
20/1/24, 1:05 pm - James: Deeney had a more established career and he's at forest green
20/1/24, 1:05 pm - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/shorts/vgF6aKxW_6Y?si=gddy6ttxbR3Rv_Hj
Then Arteta just held Pep's pocket at Man City
20/1/24, 1:05 pm - James: I think arteta should drop down a few leagues and learn
20/1/24, 1:05 pm - Gerrard: Up the Rovers
20/1/24, 1:05 pm - James: He's gone now 😢
20/1/24, 1:05 pm - James: Rodders will come back if they beat Palace
20/1/24, 1:05 pm - Gerrard: Hard game
20/1/24, 1:10 pm - Dave: Waiting for you to run out of steam. Just shit trolling tbh. Only really works if there’s an element of truth. That’s how you get the bites
20/1/24, 1:11 pm - James: It's not trolling
20/1/24, 1:11 pm - Gerrard: There is zero trolling here, this is reality wake the fuck up
20/1/24, 1:11 pm - James: I don't rate cryteata mate
20/1/24, 1:11 pm - James: Just an opw
20/1/24, 1:11 pm - James: Opinion
20/1/24, 1:11 pm - Gerrard: I understand you being loyalty but you need to be realistic
20/1/24, 1:11 pm - Dave: You’re entitled to an opinion
20/1/24, 1:11 pm - Dave: But facts are facts
20/1/24, 1:12 pm - James: What fact
20/1/24, 1:12 pm - Gerrard: Not an opinion, EVERYONE but Arsenal supporters think Arteta isn't good enough
20/1/24, 1:12 pm - James: Arsenal are operating at the bare minimum they should be
20/1/24, 1:12 pm - Gerrard: Why is no one trying to pick him up?
20/1/24, 1:12 pm - James: If you don't win something of note this year when is enough enough
20/1/24, 1:13 pm - Dave: You hired supposedly an equal to pep that has spent 600m on your starting 11 and he’s won you one title in 9 years during a pandemic, not sure where this confidence is coming from
20/1/24, 1:13 pm - Gerrard: Arteta's next job will be managing City in League 2
20/1/24, 1:13 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 he's never addressing the topic we're on
20/1/24, 1:13 pm - Dave: Why don’t you address that one?
20/1/24, 1:14 pm - James: Classic rodwell
20/1/24, 1:14 pm - Gerrard: I'm not playing your game of distracting from this Arteta chat
20/1/24, 1:14 pm - Dave: We all think Klopp is overrated
20/1/24, 1:14 pm - Gerrard: What a try to get out of this topic
20/1/24, 1:14 pm - Dave: But you continue to smoke the “he’s doing the best with what he’s got” propaganda
20/1/24, 1:15 pm - Gerrard: Not letting you get off topic
20/1/24, 1:15 pm - Dave: Bloke spent a fortune across the board and cried his way to a title. Total clown
20/1/24, 1:15 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 this is a joke
20/1/24, 1:15 pm - Gerrard: No man can act so much like a women in an argument
20/1/24, 1:16 pm - Dave: Wow, didn’t have you down as one of them
20/1/24, 1:17 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 I quit with this guy
20/1/24, 1:17 pm - Gerrard: No hope of having a real conversation with him
20/1/24, 1:21 pm - James: It's what happens when you live in a house full of women
20/1/24, 1:21 pm - James: And move to LA
20/1/24, 1:21 pm - James: He's not the same Rodwell we once knew
20/1/24, 1:24 pm - Gerrard: Sad
20/1/24, 1:28 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 Martinelli benched
20/1/24, 1:42 pm - James: Surely that was a foul by Gabriel there?
20/1/24, 1:42 pm - Jono: Striker Gabs
20/1/24, 1:43 pm - James: @14244893404 when Joelinton touches Gabriel he folds like a deck of cards?
20/1/24, 1:43 pm - Dave: You wish buddy
20/1/24, 1:44 pm - James: Not good enough
20/1/24, 1:44 pm - James: If that was at the other end... Statement FC again
20/1/24, 1:44 pm - Dave: Joelinton donkey punched him
20/1/24, 1:44 pm - James: Gabriel is a bitch
20/1/24, 1:45 pm - Gerrard: I thought it was a foul
20/1/24, 1:45 pm - Gerrard: Climbing on the defender, not letting him jump
20/1/24, 1:46 pm - Dave: Didn’t realise you can go 12th with wolves and Bournemouths games in hand 😂😂😂😂
20/1/24, 1:48 pm - James: What has Bournemouth and Wolves got to do with Gabriel being a bitch
20/1/24, 1:49 pm - Dave: Just trying to figure out why you’re so rattled
20/1/24, 1:49 pm - Dave: Now I know
20/1/24, 1:50 pm - James: Rice is like a glorified Joe Allen
20/1/24, 1:50 pm - James: Zzzz
20/1/24, 1:50 pm - Gerrard: But taller
20/1/24, 1:51 pm - Gerrard: Off topic as usual
20/1/24, 1:51 pm - James: Master of the five yard pass
20/1/24, 1:52 pm - James: That Richards for Palace is quality
20/1/24, 1:53 pm - Gerrard: Palace out playing Arsenal's "press"
20/1/24, 1:53 pm - James: Nice dive havertz
20/1/24, 1:54 pm - James: Haha ha
20/1/24, 1:57 pm - Gerrard: Stadium is so quiet
20/1/24, 2:04 pm - Gerrard: Striker for Palace is arse
20/1/24, 2:05 pm - James: Can't you hear the arrrsenal chants
20/1/24, 2:06 pm - Gerrard: I hear them applauding the most simple of actions
20/1/24, 2:08 pm - Gerrard: Another foul
20/1/24, 2:08 pm - James: That Richards is class
20/1/24, 2:09 pm - Gerrard: Arsenal needed this 6 losses in 7
20/1/24, 2:09 pm - Dave: 2-0 up what more do you want
20/1/24, 2:10 pm - Gerrard: Only thing I want is for Arteta not to be sacked
20/1/24, 2:10 pm - Dave: So when you lose to Bournemouth
20/1/24, 2:10 pm - Dave: How close will we be?
20/1/24, 2:10 pm - Gerrard: Eh?
20/1/24, 2:10 pm - Dave: 2 points off you
20/1/24, 2:10 pm - Dave: Wow
20/1/24, 2:10 pm - Dave: Some title charge
20/1/24, 2:10 pm - Gerrard: What?
20/1/24, 2:11 pm - Gerrard: OH you're playing make believe again
20/1/24, 2:11 pm - James: Palace should replace anderson
20/1/24, 2:11 pm - James: He's odd one out
20/1/24, 2:11 pm - Dave: You’ve got Bournemouth next. I know you don’t usually know who you’ve played until the 3 minute highlights are posted
20/1/24, 2:12 pm - Gerrard: Rice's passing 👌🏻
20/1/24, 2:12 pm - James: Thinks he's Jonjo Shelvey
20/1/24, 2:12 pm - Gerrard: Overpriced Gareth Barry
20/1/24, 2:13 pm - James: Can't stay up watching this
20/1/24, 2:13 pm - James: Terrible game
20/1/24, 2:13 pm - James: Palace handed it to them
20/1/24, 2:13 pm - Gerrard: Boring
20/1/24, 2:13 pm - Gerrard: True
20/1/24, 2:13 pm - James: Richards in particular
20/1/24, 2:13 pm - Gerrard: Two corners
20/1/24, 2:14 pm - Gerrard: I saw a fucked up stat that's Arsenal's barely scored in open play
20/1/24, 2:14 pm - James: Zzzz
20/1/24, 2:14 pm - James: Even the crowd have fell asleep
20/1/24, 2:14 pm - James: Roy looks like he's about to fall over
20/1/24, 2:14 pm - Gerrard: Potter's on his phone lol <This message was edited>
20/1/24, 2:15 pm - James: Congrats on beating the black panthers @14244893404
20/1/24, 2:15 pm - Gerrard: Crazy right
20/1/24, 2:15 pm - Gerrard: Trust the process
20/1/24, 2:16 pm - James: Anderson is like when forest gump attends that panthers meeting. So out of place
20/1/24, 2:16 pm - James: Shame no Olise today
20/1/24, 2:16 pm - Gerrard: Arsenal can't pass
20/1/24, 2:16 pm - Gerrard: They look so rough
20/1/24, 2:17 pm - James: Haven't seen them do anything yet
20/1/24, 2:18 pm - Gerrard: They can't shoot either
20/1/24, 2:18 pm - Gerrard: That Palace striker is hopeless
20/1/24, 2:19 pm - James: The commentators are now on about defenders scoring hat tricks it's that bad
20/1/24, 2:20 pm - Gerrard: Sub the striker off
20/1/24, 2:20 pm - Gerrard: Where's the French ex Celtic guy?
20/1/24, 2:20 pm - James: Thought that was him
20/1/24, 2:20 pm - Dave: Congrats on beating no one @61452662705
20/1/24, 2:21 pm - James: Is this Varsenals first game of 2024?
20/1/24, 2:21 pm - James: What she on about in the studio
20/1/24, 2:22 pm - James: Jesus is that real?
20/1/24, 2:23 pm - James: They've only scored 12?
20/1/24, 2:23 pm - Gerrard: Yeah nuts eh
20/1/24, 2:23 pm - James: PrOCeSS
20/1/24, 2:23 pm - James: 12 goals in 21 games for a team that's 'going to win the league'
20/1/24, 2:24 pm - Gerrard: 🤷🏼‍♂️
20/1/24, 2:27 pm - Dave: Everyone else saying that. Not us
20/1/24, 2:29 pm - Gerrard: How shakey is Raya
20/1/24, 6:04 pm - Dave: We can’t all afford an 80m keeper to bail us out every week. Surprised this is what you took from a 5-0 battering
20/1/24, 6:54 pm - Jono: Another 20 million for Toney now
20/1/24, 6:54 pm - Jono: Some free kick
20/1/24, 6:59 pm - Dave: Clever wasn’t it
20/1/24, 6:59 pm - Dave: Was thinking that 😂
20/1/24, 7:23 pm - Dave: Oh.. cheated lol

20/1/24, 9:47 pm - Pero: 208 unread messages I thought we must of dropped points again
20/1/24, 9:48 pm - Pero: Great response to a shitty slump
20/1/24, 10:59 pm - Gerrard: The guy's dying bro
20/1/24, 11:25 pm - Dave: Good job Klopp offered to “let him sit in his office for a day”. He’s not a 5 year old boy with leukaemia mate
20/1/24, 11:25 pm - Dave: Raya ❤️
20/1/24, 11:25 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 I don't understand this guy
20/1/24, 11:26 pm - Dave: Love a good dynamic shift. Your plans working ❤️
20/1/24, 11:33 pm - Gerrard: I don't understand anything you're saying
21/1/24, 2:01 am - James: Looks like we're offloading Trippier and Wilson
21/1/24, 2:04 am - James: What happened?
21/1/24, 3:39 am - Gerrard: Whoa
21/1/24, 4:17 am - Dave: Thought trippier was your best player 😮
21/1/24, 4:17 am - James: Bye trips 👋
21/1/24, 4:18 am - Dave: Crazy
21/1/24, 4:18 am - James: Bye callum 👋
21/1/24, 4:18 am - Dave: Where’s Wilson going?
21/1/24, 4:18 am - James: That's £150m spending money
21/1/24, 4:18 am - James: Atletico Madrid
21/1/24, 4:18 am - Dave: How? They’re both ancient <This message was edited>
21/1/24, 4:19 am - James: Because we'll get around £30m for them
21/1/24, 4:56 am - James: https://x.com/talkSPORT/status/1748302321728016596?s=08
21/1/24, 5:45 am - Gerrard: Trippsey > Trent
21/1/24, 6:06 am - James: Was brilliant for us up until a month ago where he's managed to single handedly fuck us in several games. Hope he goes. 33, won't get better money for him than now
21/1/24, 6:10 am - Jono: Interesting that Bayern has become a retirement village
21/1/24, 6:15 am - James: Dier signing is so odd
21/1/24, 6:17 am - Jono: Maybe just trying to make Kane feel at home
21/1/24, 6:17 am - Jono: So he doesn’t do a Hendo
21/1/24, 6:19 am - James: Kane feeling lonely
21/1/24, 6:19 am - James: Playing the head of recruitment this month
21/1/24, 10:24 am - James: Did you hear the interview where he cristised one of the players to the press?
21/1/24, 10:45 am - Gerrard: Nah missed that
21/1/24, 10:50 am - James: Nooni is ahead of haaland
21/1/24, 10:57 am - Gerrard: Record breaker
21/1/24, 10:57 am - Gerrard: That's why we're top of the league
21/1/24, 5:36 pm - Dave: Not for much longer 🍒
21/1/24, 6:17 pm - Dave: Cherries should be up here. Missed an absolute sitter
21/1/24, 7:07 pm - Jono: Awfully quiet in here
21/1/24, 7:08 pm - Jono: Aside from Dave the oracle
21/1/24, 7:23 pm - Jono: Nooni double. Running out content in here
21/1/24, 7:26 pm - Jono: The “you’re just a shit Andy Carroll” song worked out well for the 🍒 fans tonight 🫶🏽
21/1/24, 8:29 pm - James: Solanke?
21/1/24, 8:55 pm - Dave: Must have had shit in my eyes today
21/1/24, 9:05 pm - Gerrard: Can we please get an update on this?
Also an update on Liverpool's defence being shit.
Also an update on Liverpool dropping points without Salah.
21/1/24, 10:47 pm - Jono: I thought it was impossible
21/1/24, 10:47 pm - Jono: Plz confirm
21/1/24, 10:56 pm - Jono: Sven was a massive LFC fan and the question was asked to him in that context. Some great Klippity propaganda on this chat this week while he keeps us top of the pops <This message was edited>
21/1/24, 10:57 pm - Jono: In other news, maybe Man City are about to get dumped into the shit
21/1/24, 10:57 pm - Jono: Their CEO has gone to Man U
21/1/24, 11:18 pm - Jono: "Shit andy carroll"
21/1/24, 11:25 pm - Gerrard: He is just so goddamn good
22/1/24, 12:43 am - James: So Isak is a better striker <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 12:53 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/ALeOGSAxm3Y?si=LXbVSAt4nOZJLlre
22/1/24, 1:00 am - Gerrard: Better goal rate but not getting his team the wins like Nunez is
22/1/24, 1:04 am - Jono: Newy happier with prolific goal scorers & zero trophies
22/1/24, 1:09 am - James: Yeah because nooni has won you heaps so far
22/1/24, 1:09 am - James: @14244893404 get a load of this guy
22/1/24, 1:10 am - James: Nooni finally scores some tap ins and he's the best striker in the world
22/1/24, 1:10 am - James: Can't blame him for that
22/1/24, 1:11 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I thought you weren't gonna put so much energy into football banter anymore <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 1:11 am - James: @14244893404 reckon if Isak was also Mexican Jono would wank over him too?
22/1/24, 1:11 am - Gerrard: Targeting @61404060785 now
22/1/24, 1:11 am - James: First day back at work
22/1/24, 1:11 am - Gerrard: Negative vibes man
22/1/24, 1:12 am - James: Blame society
22/1/24, 1:13 am - Gerrard: That 2nd Nunez finish was worldclass
22/1/24, 1:14 am - James: Once Nooni starts biting people Jono will be screaming he's ballon d'or
22/1/24, 1:14 am - James: Don't watch your games I don't know
22/1/24, 1:17 am - Gerrard: 🥲
22/1/24, 1:18 am - James: Neither do you really tbf
22/1/24, 1:20 am - Dave: Awfully loud in here for beating a team that were considered relegation battlers a couple of months ago <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 1:22 am - Jono: He's won a community shield.... Even Arsenal claim those ones
22/1/24, 1:23 am - Jono: 2nd goal was a gem. Played great today. Not the best in the world but certainly better than you all think
22/1/24, 1:24 am - James: Fair
22/1/24, 1:24 am - Jono: Same way i don't shit talk Martinelli on here because I think he's a baller who's just down on confidence.
22/1/24, 1:25 am - James: For £85m he's the worst striker in the world
22/1/24, 1:27 am - Jono: I disagree. The worst strikers are the ones you get zero output from and pay any money for. 
Weird theory you have. So you'd rather pay 2 mil for a striker who doesn't score or assist?
22/1/24, 1:28 am - Jono: Whether we paid overs or not - his value is set from others. We paid it. He's delivering solid output. 
Therefore he's not the worst striker in the world
22/1/24, 1:36 am - Dave: I think if you’re buying a striker based purely on goal output he would be top of the shit list. 

But he’s quick, strong, causes problems at the back for oppositions and gets a ton of assists. Good to have on the pitch. 

Not worth 85m in a month of Sundays. Decent signing at 40-45. 

Similar to us with Havertz. Decent player, doing well for us. Gutted we paid close to 70m for him and can’t afford to sign anyone this window. Would rather have kept Xhaka
22/1/24, 1:36 am - Gerrard: Rodders is the new Jimmity
22/1/24, 1:37 am - Jono: Bloke was super confident pre game Cherries were gonna tear us a new one
22/1/24, 1:37 am - Gerrard: Can't be bothered reading this
22/1/24, 1:37 am - Jono: Now shitting on them
22/1/24, 1:37 am - Jono: That’s his actual team right?
22/1/24, 1:38 am - Jono: From memory
22/1/24, 1:38 am - Dave: You lot are awfully defensive. Just gave your donkey talisman a compliment there
22/1/24, 1:38 am - James: @14244893404 Jono sledging you mate what ya gunna do
22/1/24, 1:38 am - Jono: It’s Monday morning and I’m just here for some fun
22/1/24, 1:39 am - Gerrard: Well he is an actual Bournemouth fan, he just glory hunted and started following Arsenal around 2000
22/1/24, 1:39 am - Dave: Jono thinks 2 assists in 20 games is getting PFA. Respect his opinion as much as jez Jennings
22/1/24, 1:39 am - Gerrard: No fun allowed
22/1/24, 1:39 am - Gerrard: Actually 6 assists innit
22/1/24, 1:40 am - Jono: We all make mistakes

#unlocked 🔓
22/1/24, 1:40 am - Jono: Oh yeah… fake stats. Pretty common on here.
22/1/24, 1:41 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 looky what I just found
22/1/24, 1:41 am - Dave: Didn’t even know where Bournemouth was on the map when I started supporting Arsenal. 

Try harder mr “I started supporting Liverpool because my great great great aunties dog was Irish and the Irish like Liverpool and I’m a victim and I like red”
22/1/24, 1:43 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 you're loving the shift to Arsenal banter
22/1/24, 1:44 am - Dave: You’re not counting his stats from playing mechanics in Europa surely. May as well start including stats for friendlies as well then
22/1/24, 1:44 am - Jono: Says the guy who counts community shields
22/1/24, 1:45 am - Dave: Beat Citeh to win it. Better than a title 🏆
22/1/24, 1:45 am - Jono: Didn’t even watch when we won it
22/1/24, 1:46 am - Gerrard: Ok 10 assists then
22/1/24, 1:46 am - Dave: Community shield win against Citeh is more impressive than a champions league when you only had to get past spuds
22/1/24, 1:47 am - Jono: That probably helps soften the blow of no UCLs
22/1/24, 1:47 am - Jono: I get it
22/1/24, 1:47 am - Gerrard: Oooooooooooh!!!!!
22/1/24, 1:48 am - Gerrard: At least Spurs didn't get their keeper sent off and give up 1-0 lead in the last 15mins
22/1/24, 1:49 am - Gerrard: That must have hurt more
22/1/24, 1:49 am - Jono: Refresh my memory here
22/1/24, 1:49 am - Gerrard: Oh well
22/1/24, 1:49 am - Jono: How long ago did this story occur
22/1/24, 1:50 am - Gerrard: Short version, real class came through in the end
22/1/24, 1:50 am - Gerrard: 2006
22/1/24, 1:51 am - Gerrard: Some striker from Celtic carved up these Arsenal "invincibles" and setup both goals
22/1/24, 1:51 am - Jono: Oh yeah, when even their greatest PL player had to leave to chase a proper 🏆
22/1/24, 1:51 am - Jono: Now I remember
22/1/24, 1:52 am - Gerrard: And joined the team that beat them, and THEN he won the CL himself
22/1/24, 1:52 am - Gerrard: So his greatest career achievement was at another club
22/1/24, 1:54 am - Jono: So depressing
22/1/24, 1:56 am - Jono: Is that the only UCL final they ever made?
22/1/24, 2:00 am - Dave: Liverpools greatest ever PL player. Retired a disgrace to the club. Cemented in history as a meme ❤️‍🩹
22/1/24, 2:50 am - Gerrard: https://www.arsenalinsider.com/features/7-players-whove-left-arsenal-and-won-the-champions-league/
22/1/24, 2:53 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Djimi Traore has a Champions League winner's medal, Dennis Bergkamp does NOT has a Champions League winner's medal.
What a crazy world.
22/1/24, 3:01 am - Jono: So they’ve made the same amount of UCL finals as their inferior neighbours?
22/1/24, 3:01 am - Jono: Oh boy
22/1/24, 3:09 am - Gerrard: Oofft
22/1/24, 3:27 am - Pero: Anyone see the real madrid game this morning ? Ref favouritism at its finest
22/1/24, 3:28 am - Gerrard: Hard
22/1/24, 3:28 am - Pero: Mental
22/1/24, 3:28 am - Gerrard: And I got money on Girona
22/1/24, 3:30 am - Pero: How rate you get them at ?
22/1/24, 3:31 am - Gerrard: .....ok just hear me out
22/1/24, 3:33 am - Pero: 20 bucks is bloody good and a chance
22/1/24, 3:44 am - Dave: https://x.com/remontadavv/status/1749140242651595187?s=46&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
22/1/24, 3:47 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 finally rattled
22/1/24, 4:11 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/XjnH1YpZGNw?si=W75ogFQFrjr_-N2P
These guys say Liverpool are much more prepared for a run at the title than Arsenal were at this stage last season.
@61452662705 what you think?
22/1/24, 4:48 am - James: So many unread messages
22/1/24, 4:48 am - James: Who is a rattle
22/1/24, 4:52 am - Gerrard: Rodders
22/1/24, 4:52 am - Gerrard: Bringing up Gerrard's slip
22/1/24, 4:53 am - Gerrard: Got upset because we started talking about CL and you know how they feel about that.
22/1/24, 5:07 am - James: I had Gez messaging me to jump in AND Rodwell messaging me to jump in. It's like how Luke Skywalker must have felt <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 5:08 am - Gerrard: It's nice to feel wanted
22/1/24, 5:08 am - James: You guys and the dogs is all I have
22/1/24, 5:08 am - James: And even they just want something from me in return
22/1/24, 5:08 am - Gerrard: Rodders all by himself because Liam is zen now and Pero has better things to do than bicker. <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 5:09 am - James: What happened to Liam
22/1/24, 5:09 am - James: Arsenal not top so he's gone AWOL?
22/1/24, 5:09 am - Gerrard: It's all about love and peace brother
22/1/24, 5:09 am - James: Don't think I'll be friends with him anymore then
22/1/24, 5:10 am - Gerrard: Liam knew they were never gonna win so he didn't let his heart fall for Arteta
22/1/24, 5:10 am - Gerrard: Not like these other schmucks
22/1/24, 5:11 am - James: Liam's focus has gone back into crypto and Trump 2024
22/1/24, 5:12 am - Jono: A bit wild
22/1/24, 5:13 am - Gerrard: "invincibles"
22/1/24, 5:14 am - James: Bergs wouldn't fly to any of the European games
22/1/24, 5:14 am - James: He'd be screwed these days with everything held in Saudi
22/1/24, 5:14 am - Gerrard: Another rapist?!
22/1/24, 5:14 am - James: That was Overmars
22/1/24, 5:15 am - James: He's been up to no good as a DOF
22/1/24, 5:15 am - Gerrard: Bloody hell
22/1/24, 5:15 am - James: Think he was at Ajax or something
22/1/24, 5:15 am - James: Got sacked
22/1/24, 5:15 am - James: Not sure if noncing or sex pest
22/1/24, 5:17 am - James: Just skimming messages @14244893404 you've been cooked here
22/1/24, 6:14 am - James: Trippier and Wilson refusing to leave
22/1/24, 6:14 am - James: Bastards
22/1/24, 6:18 am - Gerrard: Lol
22/1/24, 6:19 am - Gerrard: Trouble in Allah's paradise
22/1/24, 6:36 am - Dave: Racist
22/1/24, 7:24 am - Jono: That’ll cause tension no doubt
22/1/24, 7:39 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 was this the France in you talking?
22/1/24, 7:39 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 ?
22/1/24, 7:40 am - James: That's on the back of Jono wanting us to sign him before your game against them
22/1/24, 7:40 am - Gerrard: Ah k
22/1/24, 7:40 am - James: Wow
22/1/24, 7:42 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 just in case, could you please state that Liverpool aren't going to win the league?
22/1/24, 7:43 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 @61422023136 @61404060785 also in all of this, we've completely missed talking about how Jota is the man
22/1/24, 7:43 am - Gerrard: Second coming of Robbie Fowler
22/1/24, 7:46 am - Dave: Remember when we thought we were winning the league last January. Feel so sorry for you
22/1/24, 7:48 am - Gerrard: Please just say it Liverpool aren't
22/1/24, 7:49 am - Gerrard: The opposite of everything you say happens
22/1/24, 7:49 am - Gerrard: Please David
22/1/24, 7:49 am - Gerrard: Just say it, you know you want to
22/1/24, 7:49 am - Jono: https://youtu.be/koJlIGDImiU?si=j4KfdjMrerP9uEz3
22/1/24, 7:50 am - James: I'll make a prediction Varsenal won't win the league
22/1/24, 7:50 am - Jono: I don’t think we’ll win it, but we’ll make it worth watching at least
22/1/24, 7:50 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 7:51 am - Gerrard: Nice one Jono, you know how your calls work too
22/1/24, 7:51 am - James: Are you saying Varsenal didn't make it worth watching last season...
22/1/24, 7:51 am - Gerrard: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 7:54 am - Jono: Out of sheer curiosity
22/1/24, 7:55 am - Jono: At what point does @61452662705 and @14244893404 start shitting a brick
22/1/24, 7:55 am - Gerrard: Hot girl with a dick
22/1/24, 7:55 am - Jono: That we might win the league
22/1/24, 7:55 am - Gerrard: Last game
22/1/24, 8:04 am - James: I don't think you'll win the league. I don't care either tbh. Well, I kinda do now because I saw Gez bet above and placed the same
22/1/24, 8:04 am - James: Got shit odds in comparison
22/1/24, 8:05 am - James: Can see Leverkusen hold out. Absolutely hilarious if Kane doesn't win the league
22/1/24, 8:05 am - Gerrard: ❤️
22/1/24, 8:05 am - James: Girona... Meh. Citeh group innit
22/1/24, 8:05 am - Gerrard: I think Girona is the hard one
22/1/24, 8:05 am - Gerrard: I could do with 10k
22/1/24, 8:05 am - James: I'll be devo if one leg fails
22/1/24, 8:06 am - James: Just getting two tight would have been unreal odds start of season
22/1/24, 8:06 am - James: When you place it
22/1/24, 8:06 am - James: Cunts will only pay over 1k now
22/1/24, 8:07 am - Gerrard: A few months ago, maybe Nov
22/1/24, 8:07 am - James: Add to the fact la liga is corrupt as any top league so Real will ultimately get a hand
22/1/24, 8:09 am - James: They slashed girona odds
22/1/24, 8:10 am - Gerrard: I thought Lev was a bit low
22/1/24, 8:11 am - James: All this and big Ange goes under the radar and snatches the title last game of the season
22/1/24, 8:11 am - Gerrard: Lol
22/1/24, 8:12 am - James: Think Kane would kill himself?
22/1/24, 8:12 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 wouldn't know whether to cry or cum
22/1/24, 8:13 am - James: Spurs have a mad run in. Think maybe in April
22/1/24, 8:13 am - James: Would be so mental if they come out of that winning them. Think they have four really hard games on the trot
22/1/24, 8:15 am - Gerrard: Need to get back to cry baby Ange
22/1/24, 8:32 am - James: https://youtu.be/Ll6p2cEB9ow?feature=shared
22/1/24, 8:32 am - James: Back to this for a sec
22/1/24, 8:33 am - James: Sorry, are we supposed to believe he didn't take or will not be taking £350k per week for six months here
22/1/24, 8:34 am - James: Is this bullshit to try and say 'hey guys look at me, I love gays and trans really I didn't take a cent of their money. Please forgive me'...
22/1/24, 8:35 am - James: I didn't and won't be taking the £9 million honest <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 8:37 am - James: 6 months worth of money which would have taken him at least five years to get at Liverpool
22/1/24, 8:47 am - Gerrard: No idea but what a waste of a legacy
22/1/24, 9:01 am - James: That's my thoughts. Is this all a PR thing
22/1/24, 9:02 am - Gerrard: For who?
22/1/24, 9:06 am - James: For him
22/1/24, 9:07 am - James: Know soon enough because he likes talking
22/1/24, 9:07 am - Gerrard: He's already done by going there in the first place
22/1/24, 9:13 am - Jono: Had a toon fan on another chat talking about title wins after claiming we’ve won zero then in the same breath saying they’ve won 4
22/1/24, 9:13 am - Jono: @61452662705 you’ve lost the title for most delusional Toon fan
22/1/24, 9:16 am - James: What's delusional about what I've said
22/1/24, 9:17 am - Gerrard: Just when I thought we were all getting along
22/1/24, 9:17 am - James: Your mate
22/1/24, 9:17 am - James: He's high off nooni <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 9:17 am - Jono: I just realised toon are almost a century into the titleless run
22/1/24, 9:18 am - Jono: As a result of this loony
22/1/24, 9:18 am - James: Nooni necrosis
22/1/24, 9:18 am - Gerrard: Forgot the Toony drought, keep the eyes on Arsenal and United
22/1/24, 9:18 am - Gerrard: Ticking up
22/1/24, 9:18 am - James: Not bad 8th most successful club in England
22/1/24, 9:18 am - Jono: He was in a beef with a Chelsea fan about Russian titles vs non Russian ones
22/1/24, 9:19 am - James: Yeah they had less than us prior to ambamovic
22/1/24, 9:19 am - Jono: Saying they won 4 to Chelsea’s 1
22/1/24, 9:19 am - James: Citeh only had two titles prior to their takeover
22/1/24, 9:19 am - Jono: But yeah, this is like Uruguay counting Olympic gold as world cups prior to the WC existing
22/1/24, 9:20 am - James: So nothing counts prior to premier league
22/1/24, 9:21 am - James: Not sure your point
22/1/24, 9:21 am - James: Would be bad for you considering you have one prem title if we discount old division 1 titles
22/1/24, 9:21 am - Jono: Anything won when you could still pay in shillings is hard to go ape shit over.
22/1/24, 9:21 am - Jono: Pre WWs
22/1/24, 9:21 am - Jono: But hey, Howay the lads
22/1/24, 9:22 am - James: And a big fuck all prior to your takeover and coming up from league 2 by outspending everyone in the late 70s
22/1/24, 9:22 am - James: @61409710717 your mate is a weirdo
22/1/24, 9:23 am - Gerrard: Whoa
22/1/24, 9:23 am - James: @14244893404 this is quite rich you'll actually like this one hahaha
22/1/24, 9:23 am - Gerrard: It was so peaceful today
22/1/24, 9:23 am - James: Your mate on a mad one
22/1/24, 9:23 am - James: Needs a nap
22/1/24, 9:23 am - Jono: It started with a compliment to Jimmy
22/1/24, 9:24 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/2SsOmjwZKrI?si=mkf63886iaIqA7eC
22/1/24, 9:25 am - Jono: As I said… it’s Monday and I’m here for a good time
22/1/24, 9:25 am - Jono: Awaiting all the Fulham fans to get excited on Thursday
22/1/24, 9:26 am - Jono: And Chelsea fans over the weekend (no idea if we’re playing again next weekend)
22/1/24, 9:26 am - Jono: Fixture list is cooked
22/1/24, 9:26 am - Jono: League cup, FA cup, two girls one cup, league I can’t keep up <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 9:27 am - Jono: @61409710717 do we have Norwich again?
22/1/24, 9:27 am - Jono: You know what that means…
22/1/24, 9:28 am - James: When is FA Cup?
22/1/24, 9:29 am - James: Saturday?
22/1/24, 9:29 am - Jono: Yeah just checked

League cup mid week, FA Cup next weekend
22/1/24, 9:29 am - Jono: League mid week next week
22/1/24, 9:29 am - Jono: Cooked
22/1/24, 9:30 am - James: Hopefully your game goes to extra time on Wednesday then because we have Fulham in FA Cup <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 9:31 am - James: Makes no sense. Most clubs just had a week off at different times then get sandwiched with two games
22/1/24, 9:31 am - James: Prem games on a Wednesday night for no reason really
22/1/24, 9:31 am - James: All for it though
22/1/24, 9:32 am - Jono: Great test of character for us
22/1/24, 9:32 am - Jono: Two cup games into Chelsea and Arsenal
22/1/24, 9:32 am - Jono: 💪
22/1/24, 9:33 am - Jono: No excuses
22/1/24, 9:35 am - James: Where's @14244893404 gone he's usually pretty active
22/1/24, 9:41 am - James: @14244893404 👀
22/1/24, 10:02 am - Gerrard: Is that Ty?
22/1/24, 10:04 am - James: Reckon he can play chess?
22/1/24, 10:05 am - James: https://x.com/SkySportsPL/status/1749110159148765526?s=08
22/1/24, 10:06 am - James: Blame Varsenal for this nonsense of releasing statements and writing to the league
22/1/24, 10:39 am - James: @61409710717 perspective needed?
22/1/24, 10:40 am - Gerrard: Nah I'm cool with it, love dem lads
22/1/24, 10:40 am - James: Your mate has been going on a bit today like you beat prime Barca
22/1/24, 10:40 am - Gerrard: I think it's just the haters doubting them for clicks
22/1/24, 10:40 am - Gerrard: Great squad to have
22/1/24, 10:41 am - Gerrard: It's all for clicks, 'Liverpool NEED another CB' - do they bro, they seem to be doing fine
22/1/24, 10:41 am - James: Other than Coutinho I know of, who have you sold for big money?
22/1/24, 10:42 am - Gerrard: It's this Man City attitude to running teams, you need to have two starting 11s that could win the CL each
22/1/24, 10:42 am - Gerrard: It's all trash talk
22/1/24, 10:42 am - James: Was Suarez a lot and was that after?
22/1/24, 10:42 am - Gerrard: Check Google yourself, lazy fucker
22/1/24, 10:42 am - James: Don't want to
22/1/24, 10:43 am - James: I refuse
22/1/24, 10:43 am - Gerrard: Well then.... guess we'll just wonder
22/1/24, 10:57 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/ATe1OOGxuis?si=PoQa-tJtK6piJ3Nv
@14244893404
22/1/24, 10:57 am - Gerrard: He's like Santa
22/1/24, 1:37 pm - James: Can't keep up with this
22/1/24, 1:39 pm - James: Ohh miggy is going to Saudi...
22/1/24, 4:16 pm - Dave: Bet he’s trying to gear up for a punditry role. Be an Owen 2.0. Like watching paint dry listening to him talk
22/1/24, 4:21 pm - Dave: Bed. Just glad you all turned on each other while I slept. Woke up with a smile on my face
22/1/24, 7:20 pm - James: That's how it works in here
22/1/24, 10:48 pm - Gerrard: Rigged
22/1/24, 11:05 pm - James: He doesn't half come out with some shite
22/1/24, 11:05 pm - James: Spitting shite
22/1/24, 11:08 pm - Gerrard: If Fowler is God, then Jota is Jesus Christ
22/1/24, 11:12 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/WEv2vVHIZes?si=WScQvRmd9dd6DZtZ
Geordie rattled
22/1/24, 11:32 pm - Dave: How much? 200m 😂
22/1/24, 11:33 pm - Dave: And the sky is blue
22/1/24, 11:33 pm - Dave: Smoking crack
22/1/24, 11:34 pm - Gerrard: If he goes for more than 15m then it's a dodge deal
22/1/24, 11:34 pm - Dave: 10m*
22/1/24, 11:34 pm - Gerrard: True, Endo was 15
22/1/24, 11:34 pm - Gerrard: So 5m
22/1/24, 11:50 pm - Dave: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/01/22/newcastle-united-transfer-almiron-saudi-trippier-wilson/
22/1/24, 11:51 pm - Dave: Gibbs white the target replacement
22/1/24, 11:55 pm - James: Love it
22/1/24, 11:56 pm - James: Quick make new rules to make sure we don't go bust for our own sake.
22/1/24, 11:56 pm - James: Gibbs white is English
22/1/24, 11:56 pm - James: Perfect
22/1/24, 11:58 pm - James: He's worth £20m
22/1/24, 11:59 pm - James: We're really struggling to keep hold of the players we're pimping out. Hard times
23/1/24, 1:20 am - Chris: I had no idea antony has 4 goals
23/1/24, 1:23 am - Gerrard: Photoshopped
23/1/24, 1:27 am - Dave: Both got 4 contributions. Maybe 75m @61452662705 ? That’s what Slob PFA POTY went for right?
23/1/24, 1:36 am - Gerrard: Ooooooo I love a Rodders comparison
23/1/24, 1:38 am - Jono: Beyond the stats I can safely say he's a brilliant player. Dropped off a bit from December onwards but we're a much better team with him there.
23/1/24, 1:38 am - Jono: My POTY shout as usual over-excitement at some of the hot filth he was offering up until about October
23/1/24, 1:39 am - Jono: I should've been clearer that i actually meant Hungarian Sportsperson of the year
23/1/24, 1:39 am - Jono: I'd have him over Miggy and Antony, put it that way
23/1/24, 2:09 am - Dave: Facts only 🤷🏼‍♂️
23/1/24, 2:10 am - Gerrard: Put up Alisson vs Haaland
23/1/24, 2:10 am - Dave: Strange comment
23/1/24, 2:11 am - Gerrard: Put up Saka vs VVD
23/1/24, 2:11 am - Dave: Another strange comment
23/1/24, 2:12 am - Gerrard: Put up Robertson vs McGinn
23/1/24, 2:27 am - James: Varpool fan overreacting to a few completed passes and a goal. Well I never
23/1/24, 2:27 am - James: Mcginn is a gun
23/1/24, 2:28 am - James: Anthony wins worst signing ever
23/1/24, 2:28 am - Dave: God ya
23/1/24, 2:28 am - James: Makes pepe look like messi
23/1/24, 2:28 am - James: Pepe
23/1/24, 2:28 am - James: ?
23/1/24, 2:29 am - James: What was his name
23/1/24, 2:29 am - Dave: Pepe was a really decent signing compared to Antony lol
23/1/24, 2:29 am - Dave: He wasn’t that bad. We just paid about 25/30m too much for him
23/1/24, 2:30 am - Dave: And 70m or whatever we paid for him was like 100m today
23/1/24, 5:04 am - James: 1 in 3
23/1/24, 5:05 am - James: Why did you guys bully him so much he had to leave
23/1/24, 5:05 am - James: Henry was crap his first season too
23/1/24, 5:05 am - James: Toxic?
23/1/24, 5:06 am - Jono: The French seem to be more hated than ever in England
23/1/24, 5:06 am - Jono: There's not a massive amount over there right?
23/1/24, 5:06 am - James: Martinelli had a similar strike rate? Usually around 12 in a 38 game season?
23/1/24, 5:06 am - Jono: I'm sure there's a lot less than in the 90s / 00s
23/1/24, 5:06 am - James: Love our French players so not entirely true about us. Just think Arsenal is toxic
23/1/24, 5:07 am - James: Yeah early to 2010s was a lot
23/1/24, 5:07 am - James: Robert was my favourite
23/1/24, 5:08 am - James: Cabaye, Ginola, Ben Arfa
23/1/24, 5:08 am - Jono: Ginola was mine
23/1/24, 5:08 am - James: Remy was good for the year we had him
23/1/24, 5:10 am - James: Italians tend to be hated a lot. Tbf not many do well outside italy
23/1/24, 5:11 am - James: Pepe is French or just from France league @14244893404?
23/1/24, 5:13 am - Jono: We had some funny ones
23/1/24, 5:13 am - James: Aquilani
23/1/24, 5:13 am - Jono: Forgot we had Anelka
23/1/24, 5:13 am - Jono: NGog
23/1/24, 5:13 am - Jono: Cisse
23/1/24, 5:13 am - James: Everyone did at some point lol
23/1/24, 5:14 am - Jono: Sakho
23/1/24, 5:14 am - James: Was at Bolton from memory
23/1/24, 5:14 am - James: Is that the one you sold for big money to palace and was then crap
23/1/24, 5:14 am - Jono: Traore was underrated
23/1/24, 5:15 am - Jono: Was always crap but looked good for us as we had a lotta shit around his time
23/1/24, 5:15 am - James: Olise is apparently French. I would love us to sign him. Someone just has to convince Howe he is English really
23/1/24, 5:15 am - Jono: I’d take him or Eze
23/1/24, 5:16 am - James: If we boot Almiron to Saudi and replace with Olise I'd be a happy man for a bit
23/1/24, 5:16 am - Dave: I didn’t 🤷🏼‍♂️ Rival fans mainly from memory. I would liked to have kept him, seemed really dumb letting him go on a free. Would have been great backup for saka. Like I said, wasn’t worth 70 odd mil at the time and didn’t live up to the hype, but he wasn’t woeful like some of the shite today at a similar price tag
23/1/24, 5:17 am - Dave: The French and the English hatred goes back thousands of years lol
23/1/24, 5:17 am - James: Twitter is a toxic place
23/1/24, 5:17 am - Dave: African. Not French
23/1/24, 5:17 am - Jono: Why are Palace fans protesting so much? They love Roy on one hand but hate the team
23/1/24, 5:17 am - Jono: They have a decent squad
23/1/24, 5:18 am - James: Would have been helpful if they didn't surrender to the nazis tbf. Could have bombed the lot of them over the Arden but didn't.
23/1/24, 5:18 am - Jono: Who are under performing
23/1/24, 5:18 am - Jono: Would assume that falls on Roy
23/1/24, 5:19 am - James: He probably gets them all confused with each other
23/1/24, 5:19 am - Dave: Was watching a doc the other day and an ex nazi said they didn’t even put up a fight. Just marched in and started taking city after city
23/1/24, 5:20 am - James: Best bit was they were told the Germans were approaching from the south and they didn't believe it so didn't bother to go check it out
23/1/24, 5:21 am - Dave: What happened to them
23/1/24, 5:21 am - James: War could have ended before it began
23/1/24, 5:21 am - Dave: Used to be animals
23/1/24, 5:22 am - Dave: You know the Vs come from an act of defiance to the French @61452662705 ? Only found that out when I left uk because no other country uses it 😂
23/1/24, 5:22 am - James: They are now. They strike like you wouldn't believe
23/1/24, 5:22 am - James: What does it mean
23/1/24, 5:22 am - James: To them and us
23/1/24, 5:23 am - James: I thought it was a more polite fuck off
23/1/24, 5:23 am - Dave: No lol
23/1/24, 5:24 am - James: They are not going anywhere with him. Such an uninspired appointment long term that served its purpose last seaon
23/1/24, 5:25 am - Dave: It means fuck off. But it came from the times when we were at war with the French. The French would capture English archers and cut their index and middle fingers off so they couldn’t fire their bows anymore. So the archers that hadn’t been caught started doing it to the French as a fuck you
23/1/24, 5:26 am - James: That's class
23/1/24, 5:27 am - James: Apparently we invented the cross bow and it was seen as unethical in war because the opposition only had archers
23/1/24, 5:27 am - Dave: Felt sad for Roy on the sidelines this weekend. Looked genuinely emotional as the fifth went in, looking around taking it all in. Potter sat in the stands waiting to take his job. He’s had a great career
23/1/24, 5:27 am - James: Dunno if that is true
23/1/24, 5:27 am - James: He must not like his wife
23/1/24, 5:28 am - Dave: With a jez stood opposite you in the trenches telling you you’re not allowed to use it as it’s against the rules
23/1/24, 5:28 am - James: War equivalent of FFP
23/1/24, 5:29 am - James: Actually I think it was the British who deemed it unethical and not fair
23/1/24, 5:29 am - James: Funny that
23/1/24, 5:29 am - Dave: Like to kill their enemies honourably
23/1/24, 5:30 am - James: Lol who did you sell to fund the invention and manufacturing of such crossbows
23/1/24, 5:30 am - Gerrard: Are you guys fighting or friendly today?
23/1/24, 5:31 am - James: Transfered our military coutinho to the French to allow it
23/1/24, 5:31 am - Dave: Bonding over English atrocities, you’re in for a treat
23/1/24, 5:32 am - James: Got some great chat up lines if you scroll above
23/1/24, 5:33 am - James: Unless you're irish
23/1/24, 6:08 am - Gerrard: Nah not looking back
23/1/24, 6:41 am - James: Growth
23/1/24, 6:44 am - Gerrard: I mean in the group chat, you English bastards need to give everything back
23/1/24, 6:56 am - Dave: So racist
23/1/24, 9:29 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2XDRE9o_Dm/?igsh=YnJmMTZwM2ZhbWgy
23/1/24, 5:29 pm - Dave: Bayern are self-sabotaging at this point
23/1/24, 10:16 pm - Dave: “Terrible form” 

“Form of his life”
23/1/24, 10:31 pm - Dave: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2VHh-HCd2l/?igsh=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==
23/1/24, 10:49 pm - Dave: Thought he was going Newty?
23/1/24, 11:05 pm - Jono: They were a few beheadings away from jagging him
23/1/24, 11:21 pm - James: He's was never coming unless he wanted to sit on our bench too
23/1/24, 11:22 pm - James: We just signed some 18 year old gun from citeh
24/1/24, 12:20 am - Dave: Thought you were getting 200m for him?
24/1/24, 12:20 am - Dave: 15m a kick in the bollocks isn’t it
24/1/24, 12:22 am - James: For a 33 year old with one season left?
24/1/24, 12:22 am - James: Signed him for £12m
24/1/24, 12:23 am - James: 75m spending money? Of which every cent generated goes into buying players since our owners take no money out because of their fabulous wealth <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 12:25 am - Dave: I mean. Liverpool got 15m for Henderson who was the same age. And trippier is the best right back in the world isn’t he? 🤷🏼‍♂️
24/1/24, 12:27 am - James: When did I say he was. @61409710717 what has happened to this guy. Is this banter?
24/1/24, 12:33 am - Dave: So you didn’t say it and @61409710717 is lying? Gez wouldn’t make something up like that
24/1/24, 1:11 am - Gerrard: What's happening?
24/1/24, 1:24 am - James: Almiron makes it another £100m spending money @14244893404?
24/1/24, 1:27 am - Gerrard: What is this celebration's meaning?
24/1/24, 1:27 am - James: Can't be arsed looking but assume another pen
24/1/24, 1:27 am - Dave: What are Saudi paying you for him?
24/1/24, 1:28 am - James: £20m
24/1/24, 1:28 am - Dave: Bullshit
24/1/24, 1:28 am - Dave: That it?
24/1/24, 1:28 am - James: Don't want you super league clubs getting too upset
24/1/24, 1:29 am - Dave: Didn’t realise he was 29 to be fair
24/1/24, 1:29 am - Dave: Thought he was way younger
24/1/24, 1:29 am - James: Not to a PIF club too. Should have took the piss and got £50m
24/1/24, 1:29 am - Dave: That’s what I mean
24/1/24, 1:29 am - Dave: Outside PL jurisdiction
24/1/24, 1:30 am - Dave: Pay 100 for him
24/1/24, 1:30 am - James: Varpool can't complain seeing how they shipped three players to PIF clubs. Including £40m for Fabinho 😬
24/1/24, 1:31 am - James: Not related party transaction
24/1/24, 1:31 am - Dave: FA can fuck off. So over it
24/1/24, 1:31 am - Dave: One rule for little clubs and no rules for the big clubs
24/1/24, 1:31 am - James: Scrap ffp
24/1/24, 1:31 am - Dave: City and Chelsea getting away with the murder here
24/1/24, 1:31 am - Dave: Everton supposedly getting docked again
24/1/24, 1:31 am - Dave: Jesus
24/1/24, 1:32 am - Dave: Clubs just trying to survive and stay in the league
24/1/24, 1:32 am - Jono: The media propaganda train already for these cheating clubs in full swing too
“The Chelsea revolution is here” I read somewhere today
24/1/24, 1:32 am - James: it's anti competitive closing the door. Super league clubs didn't give a fuck about it a year or so ago when they tried to make the prem second fiddle while bringing in extra revenue in a closed off competition
24/1/24, 1:33 am - James: All the top 6 are fucking cheats
24/1/24, 1:33 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I thought you weren't gonna put your energy into football conspiracies this year? <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 1:34 am - Dave: Isn’t forest getting done as well? Everton and forest next on chopping block?
24/1/24, 1:34 am - James: Explain how it is a conspiracy
24/1/24, 1:34 am - Gerrard: Yeah sounds like it's all fair and above board for all teams
24/1/24, 1:34 am - James: FFP serves only the established clubs
24/1/24, 1:34 am - Gerrard: Don't break the rules and you'll be fine
24/1/24, 1:35 am - Gerrard: Seems like any other set of rules or guidelines
24/1/24, 1:35 am - James: Then all tried to join a super league 😬
24/1/24, 1:38 am - James: FFP won't pass the vote in the summer. Won't get enough of the other 14 to agree just like the top six trying to block loans haha

Tears will flow
24/1/24, 1:39 am - Dave: Do you think Newcastle would have joined if anyone asked them?
24/1/24, 1:39 am - James: FSG will be fuming
24/1/24, 1:40 am - Gerrard: I think people are just trying to stop dodgey behaviour, and I think blaming past events for a reason why a team should be able to cheat now to catch up is a bit wrong <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 1:42 am - Dave: That’s true to be fair
24/1/24, 1:42 am - Dave: Totally agree. Two wrongs don’t make a right.
24/1/24, 1:42 am - Gerrard: Two wrongs don't make a right
24/1/24, 1:42 am - Gerrard: Got ahead of me ❤️
24/1/24, 1:43 am - James: Chelsea Varpool final likely
24/1/24, 1:45 am - Dave: Is what it is now. Newty and Everton etc will just have to build their teams from the ground up like we all had to
24/1/24, 1:47 am - Gerrard: Just start by winning games and finishing in Europe for a few years - just like the big teams had to.
24/1/24, 1:48 am - James: But you can't come in to the super league that's closed sorry guys
24/1/24, 1:48 am - James: And it's all about 'sustainability' we don't want you to go bust
24/1/24, 1:49 am - James: So weird since it came in that only Newcastle, Brighton and Leicester have broke into the top six. For one season each
24/1/24, 1:49 am - James: Strange
24/1/24, 1:50 am - Gerrard: I think it's just about consistency
24/1/24, 1:50 am - Gerrard: Also why do you keep mentioning the super league, I thought all the prem teams said they're against it
24/1/24, 1:51 am - James: Must be hard for teams then the top six buy all their best players
24/1/24, 1:52 am - James: Clubs who come up have zero chance of staying in the league these days
24/1/24, 1:52 am - James: That makes it OK then mate. Not like your club helped imitate big picture and tried to join that league until the backlash
24/1/24, 1:53 am - James: While championing FFP
24/1/24, 1:53 am - James: While creating a competition nobody else can join
24/1/24, 1:53 am - James: While taking all the money from that league to spend
24/1/24, 1:53 am - James: Weird that
24/1/24, 1:55 am - Gerrard: But the teams don't have to sell players right?
And if they do they get fair compensation for them
24/1/24, 1:56 am - Gerrard: Brighton have done really well
24/1/24, 1:56 am - James: They don't have to sell players. So they keep the same squad?
24/1/24, 1:57 am - James: Or let their contacts run down so they can leave for free?
24/1/24, 1:57 am - James: And get no compensation?
24/1/24, 1:57 am - James: Southampton tried the same look where they ended up
24/1/24, 1:57 am - Gerrard: I don't understand what you want, players to not leave or the club to get a lot of money for the players
24/1/24, 1:58 am - James: I think what the other 14 clubs do has nothing to do with what the already established top six clubs want
24/1/24, 1:59 am - James: I think it is anti competitive and only serves the 'project big picture' clubs
24/1/24, 1:59 am - Gerrard: So you pro FFP then?
24/1/24, 1:59 am - Gerrard: So you want cheating?
24/1/24, 1:59 am - James: What is cheating?
24/1/24, 2:00 am - James: Saudis putting money into a club they own?
24/1/24, 2:00 am - James: Money they have
24/1/24, 2:00 am - James: Into a business that is theirs?
24/1/24, 2:00 am - James: While man utd spend what they want while being billions in debt?
24/1/24, 2:01 am - James: Sounds like this all began due to sour grapes
24/1/24, 2:03 am - James: While putting as much money into their clubs (while some being in debt) as they wanted until they decided to close up shop and not allow other clubs to try do the same or compete
24/1/24, 2:03 am - Gerrard: I think it's just trying to have a level playing field for everyone
24/1/24, 2:04 am - Gerrard: If you bring in fair money then you can spend it 🤷🏼‍♂️
24/1/24, 2:04 am - Gerrard: Play good football and increase your fanbase then the money will come
24/1/24, 2:07 am - James: Says the clubs already established over the points made above
24/1/24, 2:08 am - James: Which will definitely work considering the amount of money and exposure teams who finish in the top six generate which is 99.9% of the time, the already established <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 2:08 am - James: On the other teams best players
24/1/24, 2:11 am - Gerrard: I don't know what you want then
24/1/24, 2:13 am - James: That doesn't matter
24/1/24, 2:14 am - Gerrard: What is happening in here today?
24/1/24, 2:14 am - James: @14244893404 said trippier was with £100m
24/1/24, 2:14 am - Dave: No one stopping them investing in their asset. They just have to do it fairly mate. Abide to the rules we all have to you know?
24/1/24, 2:14 am - Gerrard: That's what I thought
24/1/24, 2:15 am - James: What was happening prior to FFP mate
24/1/24, 2:15 am - Gerrard: You can't field 12 players in a match and you can't spend more money than you bring it
24/1/24, 2:15 am - James: FFP bought in under the guise to stop clubs going bust was it?
24/1/24, 2:16 am - James: Why did your clubs try stop the Saudis putting money in then?
24/1/24, 2:16 am - Dave: Nothing? We got one marquee signing every 3/4 years and bought dead wood from farmers leagues
24/1/24, 2:16 am - Dave: Just stop crying and play fairly
24/1/24, 2:16 am - James: What was the ban on related party sponsorships all about
24/1/24, 2:16 am - James: How was that protecting Newcastle going bust?
24/1/24, 2:16 am - James: Because that is what FFP is about apparently
24/1/24, 2:17 am - James: Maybe you should  have tried to ban state ownership
24/1/24, 2:18 am - Gerrard: Why would an owner sponsor they're own team? Seems dodgey
24/1/24, 2:18 am - James: Unfortunately there was nothing in the premier league rules about that
24/1/24, 2:18 am - Gerrard: But then why would they pay a company to sponsor their team?
24/1/24, 2:18 am - Gerrard: Seems dodgey
24/1/24, 2:18 am - James: Wouldn't even allow a business that an owner may have a share in to sponsor either. Weird one that
24/1/24, 2:19 am - Gerrard: Seems dodgey
24/1/24, 2:19 am - James: Exactly. Let them put money in if they have it
24/1/24, 2:20 am - Gerrard: Doesn't pass the sniff test
24/1/24, 2:20 am - Dave: So what’s the argument
24/1/24, 2:20 am - Dave: There was no FFP 20 years ago so you should be able to spend what you want in 2024?
24/1/24, 2:20 am - Gerrard: I think teams should abide by the rules
24/1/24, 2:20 am - James: All it was about was state ownership. Should have just put that in the owners and directors fit and proper test. But they didn't
24/1/24, 2:21 am - James: Make new rules up instead and hope they pass the voting
24/1/24, 2:21 am - Dave: “Well they had slaves and built an unfair advantage!!! Bring back slaves!”
24/1/24, 2:21 am - James: It's all good though. It'll all be relaxed soon 🔥
24/1/24, 2:21 am - Dave: Rules are rules. Have to respect them ❤️
24/1/24, 2:22 am - Gerrard: Before FFP it was a 1 team league and after FFP it's been a one league team but due to them breaking the rules and now FFP will punish them.
24/1/24, 2:22 am - James: Yup as long as you're not in debt. Why not?
24/1/24, 2:22 am - Gerrard: So FFP good?
24/1/24, 2:24 am - Dave: Conflict of interest having access to unlimited money from Saudi clubs ready to inject cash into Newty
24/1/24, 2:25 am - Dave: Should be addressed that
24/1/24, 2:25 am - James: So then they should have just banned state ownership?
24/1/24, 2:25 am - Gerrard: Don't need that kind of corruption in the PL
24/1/24, 2:25 am - James: Would that have not been fairer accross the board?
24/1/24, 2:25 am - Dave: Nothing wrong with state ownership imo
24/1/24, 2:25 am - Dave: Just can’t buy players off each other
24/1/24, 2:25 am - Gerrard: Just abide by the rules
24/1/24, 2:26 am - James: As long as you hamstring the owner to being on par with the poorest owner?
24/1/24, 2:26 am - James: Sounds like a good business
24/1/24, 2:26 am - Gerrard: Just be fair
24/1/24, 2:27 am - Dave: Would you be pissed if say Kroenke bought an MLS club and started buying all our dead wood
24/1/24, 2:27 am - James: And don't grow your club however you want to like we did all those years ago and throughout the premier league era because we don't like that Chelsea and Citeh made the top four the top six 😭
24/1/24, 2:27 am - Dave: Fairness is all anyone wants
24/1/24, 2:27 am - Dave: Time for transparency and honesty in the league ❤️
24/1/24, 2:27 am - Gerrard: Talking about the past again
24/1/24, 2:28 am - James: So you were against your club trying to stop Newcastle potentially loaning players from Saudi? But you are allowed to if you want?
24/1/24, 2:28 am - James: Yeah that would be nice I agree
24/1/24, 2:29 am - Gerrard: Does Arsenal own the Saudi club?
24/1/24, 2:29 am - Dave: I’m against it?
24/1/24, 2:29 am - Dave: We don’t own any other football clubs that we’re trading with
24/1/24, 2:29 am - James: You won't like it if there was transparency. It's bent as it is
24/1/24, 2:29 am - James: Shame
24/1/24, 2:29 am - Gerrard: I don't understand what you want
24/1/24, 2:29 am - Gerrard: Cheating or no cheating?
24/1/24, 2:29 am - Dave: I think he wants Newty to be given a free pass to cheat
24/1/24, 2:30 am - Gerrard: That's not fair
24/1/24, 2:30 am - James: Because your owner is only interested in arsenal as a business to make money from?
24/1/24, 2:30 am - James: All went to shit the second yanks got involved
24/1/24, 2:30 am - Dave: He would have argued against this 2 years ago under Mike Ashley. But now their club has unlimited money he wants cheating to be a part of the game
24/1/24, 2:31 am - Gerrard: That seems like a double standard
24/1/24, 2:31 am - James: Funny nobody cared about 'related party transactions' when Ashley's Sports Direct sponsored the club for guess how much... £0 per year...
24/1/24, 2:31 am - Dave: May be wrong, can you confirm James?
24/1/24, 2:32 am - Gerrard: Why is it always Newty?
24/1/24, 2:32 am - James: This doesn't sound 'fair' or 'equal' does it?
24/1/24, 2:32 am - James: Where's the 'profit and sustainability' in £0
24/1/24, 2:33 am - Gerrard: Almost like a club propped up on corruption
24/1/24, 2:33 am - Dave: So Mike Ashley was cheating and you kept getting relegated? Maybe cheating isn’t a good thing  🤷🏼‍♂️
24/1/24, 2:33 am - James: It's OK, I didn't think you super league clubs would understand fairness
24/1/24, 2:33 am - Gerrard: I think Real Madrid are the only Super League club
24/1/24, 2:34 am - Gerrard: Pretty sure all PL teams said no thank you
24/1/24, 2:34 am - James: All PL teams? Six you mean. Weird that
24/1/24, 2:34 am - James: The Sky Six
24/1/24, 2:34 am - Gerrard: I don't understand what you want
24/1/24, 2:35 am - James: Deffo no corruption at PL headquarters
24/1/24, 2:35 am - Dave: The ones that matter anyway
24/1/24, 2:35 am - James: Squeaky clean
24/1/24, 2:35 am - Gerrard: Not sure if Newtle got the invite
24/1/24, 2:35 am - Gerrard: Maybe that's why he's upset
24/1/24, 2:36 am - Gerrard: Even Tottenham got an invite
24/1/24, 2:36 am - James: Don't think anyone got the invite to the most anti competitive competition devised by the teams that formed it. Weird that
24/1/24, 2:37 am - James: Even Tottenham who helped devise it. Weird that
24/1/24, 2:37 am - Gerrard: I don't understand what you want
24/1/24, 2:37 am - James: Tell me your club is as shady as they come
24/1/24, 2:38 am - James: Tell me the premier league has a lot of fuckery going on
24/1/24, 2:43 am - Gerrard: I see City doing dodgeys and Newty sponsorships and loans are looking dodgey on first glance
24/1/24, 2:44 am - Dave: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/11/29/newcastle-documents-hmrc-tax-investigation/
24/1/24, 2:46 am - James: What is that. A potentially unpaid tax bill of £4m 😂
24/1/24, 2:46 am - James: That all you found 😂
24/1/24, 2:47 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 not denying cheating
24/1/24, 2:47 am - James: And now you're regurgitating stuff made up by a Sunderland fan prior to our game 😂 <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 2:47 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 still not denying
24/1/24, 2:48 am - James: It wasn't true and happened in 2017 😂
24/1/24, 2:53 am - Gerrard: Mostly Jimmity claiming the world is against Newtle
24/1/24, 2:54 am - Jono: Symphony matinee performance
24/1/24, 2:54 am - Jono: 🎻
24/1/24, 2:56 am - James: Chat is corrupt
24/1/24, 2:57 am - James: Yeah noticed there was no screenshots of Nooni for a while
24/1/24, 2:57 am - James: Oh no wait your mate did
24/1/24, 2:58 am - James: Best season ever versus mid season
24/1/24, 2:58 am - James: @14244893404?
24/1/24, 2:59 am - Jono: I didn’t clap for an encore yet here we are
24/1/24, 3:05 am - Dave: Think I said ones in “terrible form” and other is “Form of his life”
24/1/24, 3:06 am - Gerrard: At least someone tells the truth in here
24/1/24, 3:06 am - James: Wasn't noncy a 30 goal a season striker prior to getting asthma and joining the scousers?
24/1/24, 3:06 am - Gerrard: Pivot!
24/1/24, 7:20 am - James: Think you'll beat them at home this time?
24/1/24, 7:20 am - James: Worried about klip staring down your boys from the centre circle as they warm up pre game?
24/1/24, 8:02 am - James: https://x.com/TNFEJX__8494/status/1749844432906571843?s=08
24/1/24, 8:04 am - Dave: Beat them at home last time we played them in league
24/1/24, 8:05 am - Dave: Should be beating them, we are a better side. Just hit a bad run of form 🤷🏼‍♂️
24/1/24, 9:00 pm - Jono: Didn’t know the klan were big Fulham fans
24/1/24, 9:19 pm - Gerrard: Wtf
24/1/24, 10:02 pm - Jono: Almost forgot how bad the punditry is on Bein sports
24/1/24, 10:20 pm - Jono: Dominating
24/1/24, 10:31 pm - Dave: WTF going on 😂
24/1/24, 10:43 pm - Dave: Pressure on now boys. Fulham looking hungry
24/1/24, 10:56 pm - Gerrard: Starving
24/1/24, 11:00 pm - Gerrard: @61404060785 @14244893404 you think I should buy a plane ticket and head over for it?
24/1/24, 11:01 pm - Jono: Back to Wembley... the fans just love that place
24/1/24, 11:36 pm - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2IWa-nonGr/?igsh=MWtpd3FoYmZtdnhrOA==
24/1/24, 11:39 pm - Dave: Cunt 😂
24/1/24, 11:41 pm - Dave: What is this 
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2RjVKNMPom/?igsh=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==
25/1/24, 12:29 am - Jono: Just a shoutout to my boy Joe Gomez
25/1/24, 12:29 am - Jono: About to be benched again
25/1/24, 12:30 am - Jono: And arguably our best player this season
25/1/24, 12:30 am - Jono: What a man
25/1/24, 1:41 am - James: Imagine being us 😂
25/1/24, 1:42 am - James: That instantly made me feel better about myself this morning
25/1/24, 1:51 am - Gerrard: Should I buy a ticket and fly over for the final?
25/1/24, 1:53 am - James: If you're a proper fan you would?
25/1/24, 1:53 am - Gerrard: Would I?
25/1/24, 1:53 am - James: Can you afford a ticket though?
25/1/24, 1:54 am - Gerrard: That's what credit cards are for
25/1/24, 1:54 am - James: So no then lol
25/1/24, 1:54 am - Jono: Did you go to the game last year @61452662705 ?
25/1/24, 1:54 am - James: One life, you wouldn't go to a final to watch your team live? <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 1:54 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 how would you feel if you travelled all the way over and they lost?
25/1/24, 1:55 am - Jono: Pretty shit
25/1/24, 1:55 am - Jono: Especially to those Manc cunts
25/1/24, 1:55 am - Gerrard: Maybe if Liverpool weren't in finals every other year
25/1/24, 1:55 am - Gerrard: Understand it for 80yrs
25/1/24, 1:56 am - James: Are you giving it the biggun because you're in the energy cup final. Something you didn't care about last season?
25/1/24, 1:56 am - Jono: You can’t downplay something you flew 20 hours for
25/1/24, 1:57 am - James: You can when you had a great day out and got to spend time with family you haven't seen in years. Ticket was free btw
25/1/24, 1:58 am - Jono: If you’d won it would’ve been the greatest day of your life
25/1/24, 1:58 am - Jono: Which is completely fine btw
25/1/24, 1:59 am - James: Yeah it would have definitely
25/1/24, 3:41 am - Dave: Disgusting 
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2RYRpZtUT4/?igsh=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==
25/1/24, 3:43 am - Gerrard: Double wow
25/1/24, 3:48 am - Dave: What’s the second wow for?
25/1/24, 3:48 am - Gerrard: Asian eating dogs and Scouse eating rats
25/1/24, 4:12 am - James: Why is it so wrong to speak the truth these days
25/1/24, 4:26 am - Gerrard: 😱
25/1/24, 4:27 am - Gerrard: How does it feel knowing that Liverpool and Newtle are more likely to win a league before Arsenal does?
25/1/24, 4:31 am - Dave: Why are you swinging at me
25/1/24, 4:32 am - Dave: We’ve won three times as many leagues as you have in the era of football that actually means a shit
25/1/24, 4:36 am - James: @61409710717 think Rodwell is trying to turn the tables after the last few days. His fight backs and banter are awful these days
25/1/24, 4:43 am - Gerrard: Doesn't like when the shoe is on the other foot eh
25/1/24, 4:46 am - Dave: I’m just a footy fan wanting to chat football with my mates. Not everything is nefarious mate 🤷🏼‍♂️
25/1/24, 5:04 am - James: This chat not for you then bro
25/1/24, 5:14 am - Gerrard: "mates"?
25/1/24, 5:15 am - James: Thinks he is ange
25/1/24, 5:18 am - Gerrard: Oh fuck I've never put that together, he is like Ange
25/1/24, 5:19 am - Gerrard: All friendly with mates and fellas and I'm just a humble guy, then as soon as things go south the bitch teeth come out
25/1/24, 5:21 am - Jono: Standard wigs
25/1/24, 5:21 am - Jono: Wog
25/1/24, 5:21 am - Gerrard: You know what.... Rodders does look a bit Greek
25/1/24, 5:29 am - James: With a chip on his shoulder
25/1/24, 7:32 am - Dave: Got a belly like one right now
25/1/24, 7:32 am - Dave: Plural of friend. Thought I had at least two in here but I’m guessing this is the part where you tell me I’m a cunt and no one likes me 🥹😁
25/1/24, 8:06 am - James: Myself, yourself and Liam in here. Wonder who the two are <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 11:40 am - James: Misogynistic and non progressive mate
25/1/24, 12:16 pm - Gerrard: Typical Greek
25/1/24, 1:12 pm - Dave: Racist
26/1/24, 8:18 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/OEJjUTZjQOU?si=TSFWAc2SDVxv36g7

26/1/24, 11:52 am - Gerrard: I got a message from Chris and thought he'd fucking died 🤣
26/1/24, 11:52 am - Gerrard: C'mon Xabi 🤞🏻🤞🏻

26/1/24, 11:54 am - James: He is the reason Varpool are varpool
26/1/24, 11:54 am - Gerrard: I read the interview and still don't get what he's on to next
26/1/24, 11:54 am - James: Hodgson era incoming
26/1/24, 11:54 am - Gerrard: Germany?

26/1/24, 12:45 pm - Gerrard: Football is dead
26/1/24, 12:45 pm - Gerrard: Fighting against money cheater teams finally got to him
26/1/24, 12:56 pm - James: Klopp is black and white 🔥
26/1/24, 1:17 pm - Gerrard: Everyone has done a video on youtube
26/1/24, 1:20 pm - Pero: Lord Howe goneski ?
26/1/24, 1:24 pm - James: PIF want what they want
26/1/24, 1:25 pm - James: Klopp assistant manager
26/1/24, 1:37 pm - Gerrard: I reckon it'll be a one year sabbatical then Germany or Bayern
26/1/24, 1:59 pm - Pero: I thought he'd be at livo for 20 years and leave a legacy like Wenger or fergie
26/1/24, 2:44 pm - James: Newcastle mate
26/1/24, 2:44 pm - James: Yeah mate sure
26/1/24, 2:49 pm - Jono: Dead

26/1/24, 5:05 pm - Dave: I’ve heard he’s going to United
26/1/24, 5:07 pm - Dave: Same. Guess he didn’t have it in him. One title and out. Won’t go down as one of the greats.
26/1/24, 5:07 pm - Dave: https://www.joe.co.uk/sport/liverpool-fans-want-to-take-bereavement-leave-to-cope-with-klopps-resignation-420114

26/1/24, 10:56 pm - Pero: Jono is alive !
26/1/24, 10:58 pm - Pero: He could of done so much more instead some could see him as a quiter
26/1/24, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: Waiting to see if Pep resigns to try to take some of the media attention back
26/1/24, 11:16 pm - Pero: As soon as FFP are coming in harder klopp decides to jump ship 🤷‍♂️
26/1/24, 11:17 pm - Pero: No "energy". He has a peloton now ... what are they gona say !
26/1/24, 11:19 pm - Gerrard: Shame behaviour in here today, you should be happy he's going - more chance for Arteta to win a cup now
26/1/24, 11:29 pm - Jono: Xavi Alonso can resuscitate me
26/1/24, 11:37 pm - Pero: It's just strange he is leaving now with contract still in place till 2026. Maybe he got caught banging a staff member on a peloton and needs to leave cause of blackmail
26/1/24, 11:37 pm - Jono: Let’s see about Pep’s reputation in the next month or so
26/1/24, 11:38 pm - Jono: He did a similar thing at Dortmund from memory
26/1/24, 11:40 pm - Pero: You guys are going so well now top of the league and still in the cups just weird he is going now
26/1/24, 11:42 pm - Pero: Either this will pump up the fans and club energy higher to finish the season strong or can potentially have impact in the other direction
26/1/24, 11:42 pm - Gerrard: This is a different side of you I'm seeing today Anthony.
26/1/24, 11:42 pm - Jono: Yeah the timing is weird
26/1/24, 11:43 pm - Jono: Would of expected an announcement in conjunction with a new manager announcement
26/1/24, 11:43 pm - Gerrard: It's inspiration time, we're winning the quad
26/1/24, 11:44 pm - Gerrard: Lawrence McKenna was crying in his monologue
26/1/24, 11:44 pm - Pero: Indeed something along those lines
26/1/24, 11:45 pm - Pero: Laying out the possibilities gez for some pretty shocking news
26/1/24, 11:46 pm - Gerrard: You're acting like a real Jimmity today
26/1/24, 11:46 pm - Gerrard: I think you should all watch the interview and open up your hearts
26/1/24, 11:47 pm - Pero: Send it on I didn't see this
26/1/24, 11:47 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/x08iDQvU0YI?si=BnPQBAHoM-iVT419
@61404060785 you that kid?
27/1/24, 12:02 am - Dave: Right. Odd time to leave. Top of the league, FSG giving you all the financial backing in the world, in the final of the energy cup. 

Strange that his coaching staff are all leaving as well. But he “doesn’t have any energy left”. Clearly got offered a better job
27/1/24, 12:03 am - Liam: Klopps a quitter. Fucking weak
27/1/24, 12:03 am - Dave: He’s been banging Harvey Elliot for 5 years
27/1/24, 12:21 am - Gerrard: No longer a Gentleman
27/1/24, 12:22 am - Gerrard: Someone check on John Oliver

Pep = best coach epl has ever had 

🫣 <This message was edited>
27/1/24, 1:25 am - Gerrard: Klopp is the 5th best coach Liverpool ever had.
Pep is the only coach City ever had.
27/1/24, 2:02 am - Wilson: Ah damn... so klopp wasn't that good then 😳
27/1/24, 2:05 am - Gerrard: Hold your judgement on Pep until the 115 charges get sorted, chilly willy
27/1/24, 2:09 am - Wilson: All good, best coach, best team and best legal team in the league 🙏🏼
27/1/24, 6:40 am - James: Welfare check @61409710717 @61404060785
27/1/24, 6:49 am - Gerrard: Did my thigh at baseball and there's still an empty space where my heart used to be

27/1/24, 7:13 am - James: He's not dead mate
27/1/24, 7:35 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 told you yesterday
27/1/24, 7:35 am - Gerrard: Gaping hole
27/1/24, 10:30 am - James: https://youtu.be/YpwGar3b5Ek?feature=shared
27/1/24, 10:31 am - James: You'd rather have someone who has only managed 60 odd games in his life and won absolutely nothing? <This message was edited>
27/1/24, 10:32 am - Gerrard: I'm worried that Danny's worried
27/1/24, 10:32 am - James: This is the whole Stevie G for manager again except this time he's Spanish
27/1/24, 10:32 am - Gerrard: Yessir
27/1/24, 10:32 am - Gerrard: And sexy
27/1/24, 10:33 am - James: So klip won't manage here again or Germany where's he going then
27/1/24, 10:33 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 btw you didn't guess
27/1/24, 10:33 am - Gerrard: Year off then Germany or Spain
27/1/24, 10:33 am - James: Won't go Germany
27/1/24, 10:33 am - Gerrard: After the sabbatical
27/1/24, 10:34 am - James: Who will he manage bayern after Dortmund
27/1/24, 10:34 am - Gerrard: Not sure what the loyalty vibes are in Germany, all the players don't give a shit
27/1/24, 10:34 am - Gerrard: But Germany national?
27/1/24, 10:34 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 you think Real or Barca?
27/1/24, 10:35 am - James: Used to be that way in England years and years ago. Would rarely see players play for rivals or managers manage rivals <This message was edited>
27/1/24, 10:35 am - James: Last 10 - 15 years that's changed
27/1/24, 10:35 am - James: Like in Italy, every top player or manager has near enough managed or played for all the best teams
27/1/24, 10:36 am - James: I assume Spain. Whoever gets their hands on him first. Carlo is getting on
27/1/24, 10:37 am - James: Simone been at atleti forever. That could happen
27/1/24, 10:37 am - Gerrard: Carlo signed a two year I think
27/1/24, 10:38 am - James: Barca are broke. Xavi is a legend
27/1/24, 10:38 am - Jono: German national team
27/1/24, 10:38 am - Jono: That’s my bet
27/1/24, 10:38 am - James: After all his rhetoric and sour grapes over the years, would be pretty funny if he ended up at PSG
27/1/24, 10:39 am - James: No chance, he's a football obsessive who wants to be in it day to day. He'll go to a club
27/1/24, 10:40 am - James: Especially after having a year off being stuck at home with his wife
27/1/24, 10:40 am - Jono: I think he’s done
27/1/24, 11:05 am - Gerrard: He needs the chill vibes of international
27/1/24, 11:05 am - Gerrard: You think Southgate has any stress?
27/1/24, 11:05 am - James: Pathetic though really isn't it
27/1/24, 11:06 am - Gerrard: He could forget to travel to the WC and still keep his job
27/1/24, 11:06 am - James: Job for life if he wants it
27/1/24, 11:07 am - Gerrard: Some said he's never stopped, player to player manager to manager then team to team.
If I had money I'd love sabbatical right now.
27/1/24, 11:07 am - James: Do you think not finishing top 4 last season had anything to do with his decision
27/1/24, 11:07 am - Gerrard: Why would it?
27/1/24, 11:07 am - Gerrard: Can never tell when you're reaching or asking real questions
27/1/24, 2:51 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/eSaPrLXtLs4?si=15dhd-Xf8e-Hno9d
27/1/24, 7:31 pm - Dave: Do you reckon there will be videos of Liverpool fans turning on him when he picks up his next managerial job?
27/1/24, 7:36 pm - Dave: Someone was saying on X that the whole thing with Sven being terminal etc and recently becoming a grandad just triggered the retirement
27/1/24, 7:36 pm - Dave: But equally, why bring all the coaching staff etc if you’re not planning on moving to another club in the near future
27/1/24, 11:12 pm - Gerrard: No
27/1/24, 11:13 pm - Gerrard: You're the worst person in the group chat.
27/1/24, 11:20 pm - Dave: Jez “facts hurt my feelings” Jennings
27/1/24, 11:20 pm - Gerrard: I'm sorry for hurting your feelings
27/1/24, 11:22 pm - Dave: It’s ok. I know your life has been in turmoil the past 48 hours and you’re just lashing out ❤️
27/1/24, 11:23 pm - Gerrard: Just stating facts
27/1/24, 11:25 pm - Gerrard: I stand by my statement about Livo and Newtle winning a title before Arsenal do

29/1/24, 3:13 am - Jono: I reckon XA is a shoe-in
29/1/24, 3:13 am - James: Yeah we were talking about that
29/1/24, 3:13 am - James: Not sure what he's done to deserve it
29/1/24, 3:14 am - James: Could be another lampard / gerrard
29/1/24, 3:14 am - James: Gerrard has more pedigree than Alfonso
29/1/24, 3:14 am - James: And gerrard turned out wank when he managed in a real league
29/1/24, 3:15 am - Jono: Its a risk - but he knows the club and will be a smoother change than any other manager with Klopp
29/1/24, 3:15 am - James: If klip has no plans to manage elsewhere why is that ljinders fella going?
29/1/24, 3:15 am - James: Bring back Dalglish and Barnes dream team
29/1/24, 3:16 am - James: Barnes would love that
29/1/24, 3:16 am - Jono: The speculation there is the whole team is going coz they've had a falling out with the board
29/1/24, 3:17 am - James: Get rid of all the yanks from the prem
29/1/24, 3:17 am - James: I bet they get away with it
29/1/24, 3:18 am - James: Apparently their charges are about fraud
29/1/24, 3:18 am - James: Didn't really help matters the two stooges at prem hq went and called Everton and Forest small clubs

29/1/24, 3:38 am - James: All blinged up
29/1/24, 3:38 am - James: Planning his next shipment of oranges to underprivileged school kids
29/1/24, 3:39 am - James: Yeah one on the left. Yum
29/1/24, 3:41 am - Jono: Doing his celebration at nightclubs while he can't do it on the field
29/1/24, 4:35 am - Dave: Lovely isn’t she. Think his missus is one on the right. Apparently he plays shite when things aren’t going well with her. Pathetic, he’s on 300k a week

I’ll start supporting Liverpool if I watch any more of these edits 😂 Actually going to miss Klopp, good for the league
29/1/24, 5:05 am - James: Fuck you're gay
29/1/24, 5:22 am - James: Ranieri may as well be in there then and Dalglish
29/1/24, 5:23 am - James: And Mancini
29/1/24, 5:23 am - James: @14244893404 where do you think he ranks among these above?
29/1/24, 5:41 am - Dave: He’s a firm fifth if those are the choices. Let’s be real here, no trolling. 

He’s in the same basket with Mancini, pellegrini, ranieri, conte etc. Ranieri arguably above as he won the league with Leicester
29/1/24, 8:09 am - Gerrard: I think it's Ferg, Jose, Klopp, Pep, Wengy
29/1/24, 8:10 am - Gerrard: *if City aren't found to have cheated
29/1/24, 8:13 am - James: Wengy last!?
29/1/24, 8:14 am - Gerrard: "Stop drinking booze before games"
"Eat some vegetables"
"Stretch after games"

Genius

29/1/24, 10:20 am - James: Lions don't eat veg or stretch

29/1/24, 11:22 am - Dave: You’re smoking crack.
29/1/24, 11:22 am - Dave: Absolute pipe smoker. Swapped the mushys for pure crack
29/1/24, 11:23 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 well, Wenger never won a CL and Pep is a cheat right???
29/1/24, 11:35 am - Dave: Compare wengers first 9 seasons to Klopp’s shall we.

Wenger came 1st or 2nd in 8/9 of the seasons, won the league 3 times, won the FA cup 4 times, community shield 4 times, invincibles season. 

And achieved all that with about 50 pence in transfer fees. Levels
29/1/24, 11:41 am - Pero: Wenger changed English football when he arrived. He was a mastermind genius
29/1/24, 11:41 am - Pero: Massive impact
29/1/24, 11:43 am - Liam: Biggest*
29/1/24, 11:47 am - Dave: Pioneer of the modern game
29/1/24, 11:55 am - James: Poll says klap is the second best manager to grace English football 🤷
29/1/24, 12:09 pm - James: So he's not even Liverpool's best manager lol
29/1/24, 12:09 pm - James: I don't understand
29/1/24, 12:11 pm - James: Why would the scousers hijack a poll to make sure he at least comes second when he isn't even second in their own history?
29/1/24, 1:05 pm - Gerrard: I was off by 1 spot @61452662705
29/1/24, 1:07 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 so I guess if we go back it's Shankly, Paisley, Fagan, Ferg, Kenny, Robson, Jose, Klopp then way down about 10 or so then Wengy
29/1/24, 2:09 pm - Wilson: Man united and Liverpool boys voted more than once

31/1/24, 12:01 am - Chris: I'm chilean and I don't like other Chileans lol.
31/1/24, 12:02 am - James: I'm half Aussie and I don't like Aussies. Lot of self hatred in this group then
31/1/24, 12:05 am - Jono: https://x.com/tekkersfoot/status/1752429282503094780?s=48

Need Eze
31/1/24, 12:20 am - Dave: Passion
31/1/24, 12:24 am - Gerrard: Whitey and the Ruskie bickering and then Arteta acting like it's a big deal is adding to Arteta's negligence as a manager. <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 12:25 am - Gerrard: Getting into ETH territory
31/1/24, 12:25 am - Gerrard: You're not half Aussie <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 12:28 am - James: I have a passport that says otherwise. Could you please explain how I'm not then?
31/1/24, 12:28 am - James: Jez Shapiro
31/1/24, 12:28 am - James: Jez Barton
31/1/24, 12:28 am - James: Jez Farage
31/1/24, 12:29 am - Gerrard: Blood
31/1/24, 12:29 am - James: @14244893404 Jez is about to be racist
31/1/24, 12:29 am - Gerrard: Attitude to the English and Aussie national teams
31/1/24, 12:29 am - James: You should go to citizenship ceremonies and tell people they aren't real
31/1/24, 12:30 am - James: Video it for Rebel News
31/1/24, 12:30 am - Gerrard: I would say that you're an Aussie citizen but saying half is implying blood
31/1/24, 12:30 am - James: Don't care much for either
31/1/24, 12:31 am - Gerrard: Only if born here can you start claiming blood
31/1/24, 12:31 am - Gerrard: Think that's fair
31/1/24, 12:32 am - James: So only right way would be if the mayor cuts his hand and the person getting citizenship shakes it?
31/1/24, 12:32 am - Gerrard: I'll call you Aussie when I see you in a Socceroos jersey while calling Italians diving pieces of shit, and that we would've won the WC that year if not for that Cheating dog Grosso
31/1/24, 12:33 am - James: Good because I don't have a sister here to shag
31/1/24, 12:33 am - Gerrard: Hey that's something Aussies and The English have in common, getting screwed by Italy in a major tournament
31/1/24, 12:34 am - James: Australia is basically England but with nicer weather and better looking women
31/1/24, 12:35 am - Gerrard: And
31/1/24, 12:35 am - Gerrard: More humanity
31/1/24, 12:35 am - Gerrard: More respect for immigrants
31/1/24, 12:35 am - Gerrard: Better health
31/1/24, 12:35 am - James: You got wogs and Chinese and we have poles and Indians
31/1/24, 12:35 am - Gerrard: Better healthcare
31/1/24, 12:35 am - Gerrard: Less knife crime
31/1/24, 12:36 am - Gerrard: Better food
31/1/24, 12:36 am - Gerrard: Better people in general
31/1/24, 12:39 am - James: You've just described the City of Liverpool really
31/1/24, 12:42 am - Chris: You saying we don't have Indians? Have you been to Harris Park????
31/1/24, 12:42 am - Chris: More Indians there than India
31/1/24, 12:43 am - James: Not yet. What's the food like?
31/1/24, 12:45 am - Chris: Dunno, I imagine it would be awesome. When I lived in Parramatta I was not as open minded as I am these days.
31/1/24, 12:45 am - James: Curry tonight Gez?
31/1/24, 12:46 am - James: I bet there's awesome places to eat there
31/1/24, 12:47 am - James: Eastern Subs is ok unless you want a pint which sets you back $17 or more now
31/1/24, 12:49 am - Gerrard: Don't know any good indian places in the east.
Also if we did, Godzilla wouldn't be the only one destroying public spaces tonight.
31/1/24, 1:18 am - Dave: You’re right, he’s not, @61452662705 is full Aussie. Has an Australian passport same as you, you racist
31/1/24, 1:20 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 waiting for another Gerard Stalin post....
31/1/24, 1:22 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 this bloke is like Arteta and Arsenal, predictable
31/1/24, 1:24 am - Dave: Win every week?
31/1/24, 1:27 am - Gerrard: 🍼
31/1/24, 4:38 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2u3vlLLcpl/?igsh=MW5xOWowanplNmhz
Good ebening lads
31/1/24, 5:50 am - Pero: Jono what will you do ? It'll be different to what gez does for sure
31/1/24, 5:51 am - Jono: Haha
31/1/24, 5:51 am - Pero: Chris what will you do ?
31/1/24, 5:52 am - Jono: Poor Gez and Chris
31/1/24, 5:53 am - Jono: I dunno how I’d feel… still processing Klopp
31/1/24, 5:53 am - Jono: I’d be happier with XA
31/1/24, 5:54 am - Dave: Heard Liverpool prefer Ange because he’s more experienced than xabi. John Henry told me
31/1/24, 5:59 am - Pero: Makes sense
31/1/24, 6:00 am - James: What is the obsession with Alfonso lol
31/1/24, 6:01 am - Gerrard: Worse year ever
31/1/24, 6:02 am - Gerrard: He's hot
31/1/24, 6:02 am - James: And what's this fat fuck done? Tbf more than Alfonso but still
31/1/24, 6:02 am - James: Do you really want to go down the Spanish route... Arteta...
31/1/24, 6:03 am - Gerrard: He's different I swear
31/1/24, 6:03 am - Gerrard: Xabi is Basque Class
31/1/24, 6:03 am - Dave: I saw a Liverpool fan compilation of him shaking leverkusen fans hands and the quote “this is the man for the job”
31/1/24, 6:03 am - Gerrard: Arteta is some kind of retard goat herder Spanish <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 6:04 am - James: I've heard they want to get someone in to shadow klapp till the end of the season because FSG like how he works and want the new manager the same
31/1/24, 6:04 am - James: No joke, coming out of Liverpool
31/1/24, 6:04 am - James: Hot off the press
31/1/24, 6:05 am - Gerrard: I heard Ange for temporary to bridge the gap to Xabi
31/1/24, 6:05 am - Gerrard: Ew
31/1/24, 6:05 am - Gerrard: This new year is really starting rough for me.
31/1/24, 6:05 am - James: Steve Bruce is available?
31/1/24, 6:06 am - Gerrard: Take him over Ange
31/1/24, 6:06 am - Gerrard: I'd take Roy again over him <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 6:06 am - James: Spurts fans wanking off over him far too soon
31/1/24, 6:07 am - Gerrard: It would make me sick in the guts to see Ange win a trophy at Livo <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 6:08 am - Dave: Would Liverpool fans welcome gerrard with open arms? To be fair he’s built his experience up in Saudi now. Reckon he’s ready <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 6:08 am - Jono: No thanks
31/1/24, 6:08 am - James: Slippy has more pedigree than alfonso
31/1/24, 6:08 am - Jono: Love him but not ready to manage us
31/1/24, 6:09 am - James: Slippy managed in prem and won trophy at rangers
31/1/24, 6:09 am - James: Alfonso 60 games as a manager
31/1/24, 6:09 am - Gerrard: Negative
31/1/24, 6:09 am - Gerrard: Never ready
31/1/24, 6:09 am - Gerrard: Take him all day
31/1/24, 6:09 am - James: Alfonso manager of one of the best teams in Germany
31/1/24, 6:10 am - Gerrard: Ginger beard too
31/1/24, 6:10 am - Jono: Leverkusen were close to relegation last season I think
31/1/24, 6:10 am - Jono: Or the year before
31/1/24, 6:10 am - Jono: I’ve seen a few of their matches and seen enough to know he’d boss it
31/1/24, 6:11 am - James: Not even close lol
31/1/24, 6:12 am - James: 6th, 3rd, 6th, 5th, 4th, 5th...
31/1/24, 6:12 am - Jono: Haha they started really shit in one of them
31/1/24, 6:13 am - Jono: Did XA take over mid last season?
31/1/24, 6:13 am - Dave: Imagine if Xabi is actually dogshit, and it’s just the Xhaka effect
31/1/24, 6:13 am - James: So Alfonso relegated sociedad B
31/1/24, 6:14 am - James: Then left
31/1/24, 6:14 am - Dave: 😳
31/1/24, 6:14 am - James: And took at team that finished 3rd the season prior to 6th 😂😂😂
31/1/24, 6:14 am - James: GET HIM SIGNED UP
31/1/24, 6:15 am - James: I endorse this appointment
31/1/24, 6:15 am - Dave: Does handshakes and hugs innit
31/1/24, 6:15 am - James: So one of the best teams in Germany
31/1/24, 6:16 am - Jono: Give him a crack
31/1/24, 6:16 am - James: No right at the start. Few months in
31/1/24, 6:17 am - James: Alfonso is shite
31/1/24, 6:17 am - James: Great player
31/1/24, 6:17 am - James: Shouldn't even be entertained as a Liverpool manager. Yet
31/1/24, 6:17 am - Jono: Let’s see… I’m willing to take him.
31/1/24, 6:18 am - James: I am also willing for you to take him
31/1/24, 6:23 am - Dave: Look let’s be honest, whoever takes over that role at Liverpool is fucked anyway after the Klopp era. Doesn’t really matter who it will be, team more than likely going to be dog shite for a season or two and the new manager will get chased out with a pitchfork. Always the way
31/1/24, 6:23 am - James: Like the last batman movie, was always going to suck in comparison to the others
31/1/24, 6:24 am - James: Bar not that high though. Just win one prem during a global pandemic in ten years
31/1/24, 6:26 am - Gerrard: @61452662705
Poor kid's been an Arsenal fan too long
31/1/24, 6:26 am - James: Gez would you take arteta?
31/1/24, 6:26 am - James: Or Emery
31/1/24, 6:26 am - James: Tuchel?
31/1/24, 6:27 am - Gerrard: Xabi 
Emery
De Zerbi
1000 levels of feces 
Steve Bruce
Arteta
Ange
31/1/24, 6:27 am - James: Why xabi
31/1/24, 6:27 am - Dave: Christ, what don’t you agree with about that statement. Did Emery or Moyes do well after Wenger and Fergie? And don’t for one second think I’m comparing Klopp to those two legends of the game
31/1/24, 6:28 am - James: I'd be fucked off if we sacked Howe for Xabi
31/1/24, 6:28 am - James: I think Dr Zerbi deserves a crack
31/1/24, 6:29 am - James: De
31/1/24, 6:29 am - Gerrard: Love him.
Who taught him.
Intelligent.
Like his record at Lever.
Players and club will respect him for all he's done.
Great dress style.
I'd boof him if gay.
31/1/24, 6:29 am - Gerrard: That's cool
31/1/24, 6:29 am - Gerrard: You do you boo
31/1/24, 6:30 am - Dave: Sign him up baby!
31/1/24, 6:30 am - James: You've described gerrard except he isn't intelligent or has great dress sense
31/1/24, 6:30 am - Gerrard: And wouldn't boof him
31/1/24, 6:30 am - Dave: You know I saw an interesting fact earlier. Through Arsenals darkest “banter club” era of the last decade, we’ve won more trophies than Klopp did during his time at Liverpool. 9 vs 7. 

Klopp the cult hero
31/1/24, 6:30 am - James: Yeah you would
31/1/24, 6:30 am - Dave: Lies
31/1/24, 6:30 am - Gerrard: And he's won leagues....
31/1/24, 6:30 am - Dave: You’d ride him like winx
31/1/24, 6:31 am - Gerrard: Zero chance, ugly cunt
31/1/24, 6:31 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 that was directed to Stevie not you <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 6:32 am - Dave: Don’t worry, no confirmation needed after spending Mardi Gras with you one year ❤️
31/1/24, 6:32 am - James: Jessie Marsch has more pedigree
31/1/24, 6:32 am - Gerrard: Worse kiss I've ever had
31/1/24, 6:32 am - Gerrard: Don't be upset
31/1/24, 6:32 am - Gerrard: I don't care
31/1/24, 6:33 am - James: Oh my!?
31/1/24, 6:33 am - James: Steve McClaren won the Dutch league with Twente
31/1/24, 6:33 am - James: That was impressive
31/1/24, 6:35 am - James: Should bring back Rafa he still has a house in Liverpool
31/1/24, 6:36 am - James: I think you can still buy them in the city for £2
31/1/24, 6:36 am - James: No joke
31/1/24, 6:41 am - Gerrard: Any CL?
31/1/24, 6:43 am - Dave: Got to get these in before years of pain ahead mate, I get it ❤️
31/1/24, 6:47 am - James: Think Leverkusen are only decent because of Wirtz
31/1/24, 6:48 am - James: And season prior Diaby who now plays in a real league and isn't as good as Bailey
31/1/24, 6:48 am - James: Diaby looked like one of the best right mids last few years and now just looks mid
31/1/24, 6:49 am - James: Jose would be perfect for international football
31/1/24, 6:49 am - Gerrard: You think it's gonna get worse for Arsenal?
31/1/24, 6:50 am - Gerrard: And Xhaka
31/1/24, 6:50 am - James: Wirtz is like Havertz but will actually do something with his career
31/1/24, 6:52 am - Dave: I’d be in heaven if we got him in for England
31/1/24, 6:53 am - James: Follow in Sir Bobby's footsteps
31/1/24, 6:55 am - Dave: Squeaky bum time lad. If you slip up against cheski tomorrow and we beat you Sunday 👋🏼
31/1/24, 7:07 am - Gerrard: We living in make believe land again @61452662705
31/1/24, 7:08 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 what's you favourite IFs?
31/1/24, 7:08 am - James: Ifs and buts
31/1/24, 7:10 am - Gerrard: My favourite is - IF Arsenal weren't pure bred bottle jobs, they would've won the league last year
31/1/24, 7:19 am - Dave: Hate to break it to you buddy but you bottled it against city twice and we bottled once 😂
31/1/24, 7:22 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2cBTGHs0G1/?igsh=emFocWwxN25xMmhr
More and more coming out about this club @14244893404
31/1/24, 7:22 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 does he only have a 1 year memory?
31/1/24, 7:30 am - Chris: I'll be like those guys who didn't know klopp was manager. They followed the team, didn't know who's leading them lol
31/1/24, 7:34 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 let's play a game....

I'm gonna show you 4 pictures and you tell me which one links with each of these 4 descriptions.

1. Bottle jobs.
2. Most incredible season ever and we're back!

31/1/24, 9:42 pm - Gerrard: Fucking Spurs
31/1/24, 9:42 pm - Dave: Deserved goal. Liverpool dominant
31/1/24, 9:42 pm - Gerrard: Suck up
31/1/24, 9:43 pm - Dave: Apologies. You’re shit smelly plastic scousers and don’t deserve anything. Better?
31/1/24, 9:43 pm - Gerrard: Are you talking to me?
31/1/24, 9:44 pm - Dave: Only ever you
31/1/24, 9:44 pm - Gerrard: Who are you?
31/1/24, 9:48 pm - Jono: Chilwell has gone to shit
31/1/24, 9:48 pm - James: Fucking Brentford
31/1/24, 9:48 pm - James: Wow
31/1/24, 9:50 pm - Dave: Liked Liverpool before I met you
31/1/24, 9:51 pm - Dave: Shit isn’t it
31/1/24, 9:51 pm - James: Ange has them knocked out of everything
31/1/24, 9:51 pm - James: Would be a monumental fuck up if they don't get CL
31/1/24, 9:52 pm - Dave: Classic spursy though 🤞
31/1/24, 9:52 pm - James: Villa more likely to drop
31/1/24, 9:52 pm - James: Because they're not as good as they think they are
31/1/24, 9:52 pm - James: And still in two cups
31/1/24, 9:55 pm - Dave: How old is that Connor Bradley?
31/1/24, 9:59 pm - James: Come on Brentford
31/1/24, 10:24 pm - James: Nooni can't even score a pen
31/1/24, 10:36 pm - Pero: No real suprise
31/1/24, 11:24 pm - Gerrard: Arsenal AND Tottenham's villian now

31/1/24, 11:42 pm - Jono: Bring on Feb 🫡
31/1/24, 11:42 pm - Gerrard: Well Davey's make believe land statement didn't work out so far
31/1/24, 11:43 pm - Gerrard: I won't believe Arsenal aren't bottle jobs until they fucking win something.
31/1/24, 11:43 pm - Gerrard: They can beat us next game and it still won't mean shit to me.
31/1/24, 11:44 pm - Gerrard: Win something then talk, can't believe getting top 4 last season has changed their mindset about who they are so much.
31/1/24, 11:47 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 what's the odds of Kloppy doing a Fergie U-turn?
31/1/24, 11:59 pm - James: Don't think he will
1/2/24, 12:00 am - James: Because artery has never won anything?
1/2/24, 12:01 am - Gerrard: Only the hearts and minds of delusional Arsenal fans.
1/2/24, 12:01 am - James: Did atata win anything as a player?
1/2/24, 12:01 am - Gerrard: Moyes' favourite award
1/2/24, 12:02 am - James: Varsey might be 5th and we might be 6th this weekend
1/2/24, 12:02 am - Gerrard: I played with Tim Cahill award
1/2/24, 12:02 am - James: Yet we are having a shocker apparently and they are flying?
1/2/24, 12:03 am - James: @61409710717 most our team has been out all season and they have been fully fit
1/2/24, 12:03 am - Gerrard: I looked at the table and thought Arsenal and Newty could be like passing ships in the night soon enough.
1/2/24, 12:07 am - Gerrard: Connor Fucking Bradley
1/2/24, 12:08 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 Sloppy scored, better go update your player comparison screenshots
1/2/24, 12:12 am - Dave: Pretty sure everyone has said were shite and off the boil this season. Haven’t heard anyone use the term “flying”
1/2/24, 12:15 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 🪇
1/2/24, 12:32 am - James: I had Dave's mate send me a screenshot of the table the other week saying it's not looking good for us?
1/2/24, 12:33 am - James: Didn't want to dog me in this group so went into my DM's apparently
1/2/24, 12:33 am - Dave: Who was that?
1/2/24, 12:33 am - James: Your varsy mate
1/2/24, 12:34 am - Dave: I don’t have any mates, lone toxic wolf aren’t I @61409710717 🤷🏼‍♂️
1/2/24, 12:46 am - Pero: Pretty much all level except havertz has more goals,  yellows , and more passion
1/2/24, 12:47 am - Dave: Higher work rate as well mate. Doesn’t go missing for months. And played 2/3 of the minutes 🤷🏼‍♂️ <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 12:58 am - Gerrard: Don't know who the fuck you are mate <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 12:59 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Jesus even Anthony is defending Havertz now
1/2/24, 1:01 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2x-Y4jssSW/?igsh=eGx0YW11cmxxMWVk
1/2/24, 2:04 am - Pero: Must be hard for nuni looking at jota powering through on goal and relying on Bradley to get the goals
1/2/24, 2:05 am - Gerrard: Fuck Pero your smack talk is almost as bad as Clickbait Davey's
1/2/24, 2:08 am - Gerrard: I think Davey's Delusion is contagious <This message was edited>

1/2/24, 2:14 am - James: I think you'll win comprehensively
1/2/24, 2:14 am - James: No joke
1/2/24, 2:15 am - James: I think they'll dominate most the play
1/2/24, 2:15 am - James: But you'll take your chances
1/2/24, 2:16 am - Gerrard: Well they've been our smaller club bogey team a bit lately, apart from the cups obviously, it's not like the old days of pumping them for 4 or 5 goals.
1/2/24, 2:16 am - James: I think arteasta will throw a tantrum on the touchline
1/2/24, 2:16 am - Gerrard: Oh put money on it
1/2/24, 2:16 am - James: And they'll be 5th by Monday morning
1/2/24, 2:17 am - James: Progress
1/2/24, 2:17 am - Gerrard: Playing negative football catches up with all of them some day
1/2/24, 2:17 am - Gerrard: They should hire Jose
1/2/24, 2:18 am - James: Has Robbie done a motivational video yet
1/2/24, 2:18 am - James: Wherever you are
1/2/24, 2:18 am - James: Africa
1/2/24, 2:18 am - James: Antarctica
1/2/24, 2:18 am - James: Europe
1/2/24, 2:19 am - James: Er, South Africa

1/2/24, 2:21 am - James: Hence the disappearance
1/2/24, 2:21 am - Gerrard: Baile Atha Cliath
1/2/24, 2:21 am - Gerrard: France I think
1/2/24, 2:22 am - James: Never find him in Paris
1/2/24, 2:22 am - Gerrard: Or is it an Interpol warrant so he can't enter the EU?
1/2/24, 2:22 am - James: Under the eiffel tower
1/2/24, 2:22 am - Gerrard: He def voted for brexit
1/2/24, 2:22 am - Dave: Absolutely. 10-0 Liverpool at least
1/2/24, 2:23 am - Dave: Conor Bradley 5 goals minimum 💦
1/2/24, 2:24 am - Dave: Shocking effort
1/2/24, 2:34 am - Gerrard: Yes Arsenal efforts were terribly shocking in the last 10 years, remember when Skrtel got a double against Arsenal??? <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 2:34 am - Dave: Still won more trophies than you in last ten years
1/2/24, 2:34 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 this doesn't seem right does it
1/2/24, 2:35 am - Jono: Can we fact check this?
1/2/24, 2:35 am - Dave: Go for gold
1/2/24, 2:37 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 also check that it's got the coefficient on community shields and domestic cups vs CL/PL/club World cup wins
1/2/24, 2:41 am - Jono: Jesus @14244893404 you counting 5 community shields?
1/2/24, 2:41 am - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1/2/24, 2:41 am - Jono: Happy to count the 4 FA cups
1/2/24, 2:42 am - Jono: Look, if that makes you feel superior
1/2/24, 2:42 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 how many community shields they get into by winning vs coming 2nd? <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 2:42 am - Jono: I’ll let it go
1/2/24, 2:42 am - Jono: I just want people to feel good about themselves
1/2/24, 2:44 am - Jono: So it’s 6 to 4 if you don’t count the Community shields. I’m not counting ours. Dont feel it’s right
1/2/24, 2:44 am - Jono: But again, whatever floats your boat
1/2/24, 2:49 am - Gerrard: What a mastermind @61404060785
1/2/24, 2:49 am - Jono: It’s like Spurs claiming the Audi Cup
1/2/24, 2:49 am - Dave: @61452662705 did you know this? I thought Klopp was voted second best manager in prem history.
Maybe I imagined it
1/2/24, 2:50 am - Gerrard: He's really going off the rails in here with no backup
1/2/24, 2:51 am - Jono: He was hoping someone else would fact check to save the embarrassment
1/2/24, 2:51 am - Jono: Is there a special cup Arsenal and Liverpool play for in the PL season. Just checking in case they win on Sunday
1/2/24, 2:52 am - Gerrard: Nah he does this thing where he lies and then if you look up the truth he claims you're rattled
1/2/24, 2:52 am - Dave: No embarrassment, trophy is a trophy. 9 vs 7 during the best era of your lives. The cult is alive and kicking ❤️
1/2/24, 2:52 am - Gerrard: Mastermind
1/2/24, 2:53 am - James: 😲
1/2/24, 2:53 am - Gerrard: Exposed, innit
1/2/24, 2:54 am - Dave: I know we often dm about how overrated Klopp is, but I don’t think you even knew this stat did you. Arsenal during its banter years out trophied Liverpool
1/2/24, 2:54 am - Gerrard: Do we get the Christmas cup back?
1/2/24, 2:55 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 he's doing that thing where he talks DM items in the group to force an exposure, chick behaviour
1/2/24, 2:56 am - Dave: Headless chickens now I’ve dropped the grenade. I’m going to go and enjoy my evening 👋🏼
1/2/24, 2:56 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 would you trade the Christmas Cup and the Community Shield for a Carabou Cup or an FA Cup?
1/2/24, 2:57 am - Jono: I know this feeling well actually. I used to celebrate when I’d win a trophy on FIFA
1/2/24, 2:57 am - James: Just like Rebecca Vardy
1/2/24, 2:57 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 his delusion isn't limited to Arsenal being a good team lol
1/2/24, 2:59 am - Jono: It’s funny on transfermarket they call it the English Super Cup
1/2/24, 3:00 am - Jono: Just for people like Dave to wank off over it
1/2/24, 3:00 am - Jono: Either that or they have NFI what it’s called
1/2/24, 3:01 am - Gerrard: Runners up count as half?
1/2/24, 3:37 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 @14244893404 he's gone deep diving
1/2/24, 3:45 am - Jono: Short memories
1/2/24, 3:46 am - Jono changed this group's icon
1/2/24, 4:38 am - Gerrard: Yeah @61402741193 was waiting for you to see that one
1/2/24, 4:41 am - Chris: Yep, I saw what you did there
1/2/24, 4:41 am - Pero: Is jota trying to look like salah ? Cmon jot you are your own man
1/2/24, 4:42 am - Gerrard: Pero just stop you're embarrassing yourself.
1/2/24, 4:44 am - Pero: These are compliments to jot, I know its crying times that klopp is leaving but stop being so defensive
1/2/24, 4:45 am - Gerrard: It's photoshopped, bro.
1/2/24, 4:46 am - Gerrard: Don't be on Dave's side of history.
1/2/24, 4:51 am - Pero: That makes it even worse 😅
1/2/24, 4:54 am - Gerrard: You're aligning yourself with a bad crowd
1/2/24, 4:58 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2pSVseI_9c/?igsh=Y2gzc2t5bGRiNzlm
1/2/24, 5:02 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 how's about Jota muscling off a CB twice his height
1/2/24, 5:06 am - Gerrard: Chilwell diving too
1/2/24, 5:06 am - Gerrard: Booked
1/2/24, 5:07 am - Jono: Thiago Silva no less
1/2/24, 5:07 am - Jono: And that number 5 whatever his name is
1/2/24, 5:07 am - Gerrard: Nah it was the other guy
1/2/24, 5:07 am - Jono: He was absolutely horrific
1/2/24, 5:07 am - Jono: How much did they pay for that number 5
1/2/24, 5:08 am - Gerrard: How much does Saka get paid?
1/2/24, 5:09 am - Gerrard: Right now would you say Saka is better then McGinn @61452662705 ?
1/2/24, 5:09 am - Jono: He went between number 5 and 6
1/2/24, 5:10 am - Jono: How much did they pay for Badiashite
1/2/24, 5:11 am - Jono: They should’ve realised just from his name it wasn’t gonna work
1/2/24, 5:16 am - Pero: Jurgen knows how to score goals but somehow can't teach nuni to score. Is it nuni or klopps caching skills thats the issue ?
1/2/24, 5:23 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 the commentators aren't even talking about playing Arsenal, talking about the City match in March
1/2/24, 5:36 am - Dave: How do you know what they say? You don’t watch football
1/2/24, 5:36 am - Dave: Only got time for 3 minute highlights but can listen to Rory Jennings waffle shite for 3 hours a day
1/2/24, 5:38 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 why is this guy talking to me?
Do you know him?
1/2/24, 5:38 am - Dave: Awful. You can’t keep running to this one, do better
1/2/24, 5:38 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 commenting on his own messages again because no one has his back
1/2/24, 5:40 am - Dave: @61422023136 comes in strong every now and then 👊. @61452662705 will turn on you when Newcastle muscle back into top 4
1/2/24, 5:46 am - Pero: 👊👊we need some good energy and vibes for mondY
1/2/24, 5:46 am - Gerrard: Scrounging
1/2/24, 5:46 am - Gerrard: Innit
1/2/24, 5:47 am - Jono: The amount of shit we cop you’d think we’re 9th like where we were last year this time
1/2/24, 5:48 am - Gerrard: No dignity with his Arsenal fans.
1/2/24, 5:49 am - Jono: The Arse fan girls here were blowing more than we are now when they snuck a win vs Luton in early December
1/2/24, 5:50 am - Jono: Can imagine they’ll ejaculate a river of cum if they win on Sunday
1/2/24, 5:50 am - Gerrard: Well, they are known for early celebrations just like Bournemouth last year.
1/2/24, 5:51 am - Gerrard: They will think the title is back on for them.
1/2/24, 5:56 am - Dave: Looking forward to it, will be a great game
1/2/24, 5:56 am - Dave: What title? We were out of it a long time ago. Liverpool have already won the title from what I’m hearing
1/2/24, 6:10 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Acceptance?
1/2/24, 6:26 am - James: So much 😲 in here today can't keep up
1/2/24, 7:05 am - Jono: Just to bring @61452662705 back into the mixer
1/2/24, 7:38 am - Gerrard: Relax, Jimmity is anti Arsenal this week
1/2/24, 8:02 am - Jono: Well that’s just boring then innit
1/2/24, 8:17 am - Dave: Better keep him on side in case we win on Sunday
1/2/24, 8:20 am - Gerrard: If Arsenal win on Sunday nothing changes, anyone can beat anyone in a single game.
Still bottle jobs, Arteta ain't a real manager, team full of weak willed boys, supporters all a pack of whinging cunts.
1/2/24, 8:47 am - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/shorts/IzCS8yIXI_s?si=Shcmx50Yot8jjS9j
1/2/24, 11:16 am - James: Don't watch varsenpool games so what happened
1/2/24, 11:16 am - Gerrard: I started that
1/2/24, 11:16 am - James: Should just drop the 'li'
1/2/24, 11:16 am - James: Easier to type
1/2/24, 11:16 am - Gerrard: Nah you need it
1/2/24, 11:17 am - James: Poch out trending now too
1/2/24, 11:18 am - Pero: https://youtu.be/iMgFPB6IokI?si=cFMQZ_C1phTR5G_u

1/2/24, 9:20 pm - Jono: I don’t get it
1/2/24, 9:20 pm - Jono: Looks pretty relaxed to me
1/2/24, 9:20 pm - Gerrard: Rodders is just trying to make Arsenal a thing
1/2/24, 9:48 pm - Dave: Have to. Have a feeling you’re going to smash us on Sunday so need to get the boot in before I’m bent over next week
1/2/24, 10:28 pm - James: What are wolves playing at
1/2/24, 10:28 pm - James: 2-0 down at home to that
1/2/24, 10:31 pm - Louie: United are back. Looking heaps better with Martinez and Casemiro back. We are actually challenging for the ball instead of letting teams run through us.
1/2/24, 10:31 pm - Louie: Even Rashford scored
1/2/24, 10:36 pm - Dave: United were playing really well, need another goal to bury it. Wolves biting back a little here
1/2/24, 10:36 pm - Gerrard: ETH gutless if he played Rashford
1/2/24, 10:37 pm - James: If manure and Newcastle get their best players back for the run in, could be squeaky bum time for Arsenal and Villa...
1/2/24, 10:38 pm - Louie: He missed the game against Newport
1/2/24, 10:38 pm - Louie: And got fined 2 weeks of wages
1/2/24, 10:48 pm - Dave: Missed the game against Newport because he was wrapped around the toilet bowl chucking his guts up after a two night bender 😂
1/2/24, 10:49 pm - Gerrard: Chucking up tequila and semen
1/2/24, 10:49 pm - James: Nah that big titties sorts squirt
1/2/24, 10:50 pm - James: 😋
1/2/24, 10:50 pm - Gerrard: It's all a front
1/2/24, 10:50 pm - James: Gay as aids?
1/2/24, 10:50 pm - Gerrard: A foursome where the two girls get less and less attention as the night goes on
1/2/24, 10:51 pm - Louie: McTomigol!!!!!!
1/2/24, 10:51 pm - James: Taking it from his mandingo mate while rallying lines of her baps
1/2/24, 10:52 pm - Gerrard: Sexuality is a spectrum
1/2/24, 10:53 pm - James: See cas and martz got booked already. Be suspended soon enough
1/2/24, 10:53 pm - James: True
1/2/24, 11:06 pm - Gerrard: Can't believe Arsenal fans comparing him to any new Liverpool players
1/2/24, 11:08 pm - Dave: I’d consider it if I could have a go on those
1/2/24, 11:10 pm - Gerrard: "consider it"
1/2/24, 11:10 pm - James: Ahahahaha
1/2/24, 11:11 pm - James: Maunure
1/2/24, 11:11 pm - James: The gift that keeps on giving
1/2/24, 11:11 pm - Louie: Shouldn’t have made those subs
1/2/24, 11:11 pm - James: Absolute pony
1/2/24, 11:12 pm - Dave: You’d kick the girl with the cans out the room
1/2/24, 11:12 pm - Dave: What’s happened?
1/2/24, 11:12 pm - Louie: Mainoo!!!!!!!!!!!!
1/2/24, 11:12 pm - Gerrard: Liam's alive!
1/2/24, 11:12 pm - James: Noooooo
1/2/24, 11:13 pm - James: Still pony
1/2/24, 11:13 pm - Louie: Zidane like
1/2/24, 11:13 pm - James: Keeper should save that
1/2/24, 11:13 pm - Jono: @61409710717 you jinxed it this time
1/2/24, 11:13 pm - James: Could see it a mile off
1/2/24, 11:13 pm - Jono: Just noting this when I cop it on my next jinx
1/2/24, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: Jimmity jinxed it
1/2/24, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: I just laughed
1/2/24, 11:14 pm - James: True
1/2/24, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: It was Liam who jinxed it, first message in months
1/2/24, 11:17 pm - James: Shame
1/2/24, 11:18 pm - Louie: We’re not back yet, but we are getting there
1/2/24, 11:19 pm - Louie: What a great way to end the week
1/2/24, 11:19 pm - Gerrard: Gotta ask questions about this injury time
1/2/24, 11:21 pm - Jono: Haha
Garancho copped a yellow card for ripping his shirt off celebrating Mainoo’s goal
1/2/24, 11:21 pm - Jono: Peak Utd
1/2/24, 11:22 pm - Gerrard: They're almost as bad as Arsenal
1/2/24, 11:26 pm - Jono: He was subbed too
1/2/24, 11:26 pm - Jono: Hilarious
1/2/24, 11:28 pm - Gerrard: @61413646755 another barely win the mask over the deep cracks of United?
1/2/24, 11:28 pm - Jono: Mainoo's goal btw was brilliant
1/2/24, 11:29 pm - Gerrard: Can't find an emoji for a cocksucker
1/2/24, 11:31 pm - Jono: https://x.com/SwearingSport/status/1753172184770510989?s=20
2/2/24, 12:01 am - Gerrard: Settle fuck down eh, I just saw it
2/2/24, 12:07 am - James: Keeper shit
2/2/24, 12:07 am - James: Only place he could put it
2/2/24, 12:10 am - Gerrard: It was just a good shot 👍🏻
2/2/24, 12:16 am - Jono: Had some work to do to find an opening
2/2/24, 12:17 am - Jono: Fuck me though
2/2/24, 12:17 am - Jono: Close him down cunts
2/2/24, 12:17 am - Jono: Wolves man... making up the numbers as usual
2/2/24, 12:17 am - Jono: Peri peri slurping fucks
2/2/24, 12:21 am - James: That and it was blindingly obvious what he was about to do
2/2/24, 12:22 am - James: Racist
2/2/24, 12:22 am - Gerrard: Trippsey would've stopped him
2/2/24, 12:22 am - James: Trent would have fallen over
2/2/24, 12:22 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 what's going with Trippsey and Cullum?
2/2/24, 12:22 am - James: Or not even been there
2/2/24, 12:23 am - Gerrard: Best player in the league this season <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 12:23 am - James: At what?

2/2/24, 12:23 am - James: Settle down Jono
2/2/24, 12:23 am - Gerrard: You missed my question
2/2/24, 12:24 am - Gerrard: Was the deadline Jan 31st?
2/2/24, 12:24 am - James: Nothing. One is injured as usual. I expect Wilson to be offloaded in the summer
2/2/24, 12:24 am - James: Yeah all done
2/2/24, 12:24 am - James: Nobody signed anyone
2/2/24, 12:24 am - James: Of note I'm aware of
2/2/24, 12:24 am - Gerrard: Newty said no and no repeat offers?
2/2/24, 12:25 am - James: Yeah
2/2/24, 12:25 am - Gerrard: Weird
2/2/24, 12:25 am - James: No point in jan
2/2/24, 12:25 am - Gerrard: Backup players
2/2/24, 12:25 am - James: Unless you want to pay too much for a replacement
2/2/24, 12:25 am - Gerrard: As in the team that was chasing
2/2/24, 12:25 am - James: Onana will leave Everton
2/2/24, 12:26 am - James: Will be a good signing
2/2/24, 12:26 am - James: Almiron wouldn't leave
2/2/24, 12:26 am - James: Was accepted and he said no
2/2/24, 12:27 am - James: Phillips went to Spam so they got a better player than Rice for less than half the price
2/2/24, 12:27 am - Gerrard: Frogman defiant
2/2/24, 12:28 am - James: They got a CL winner
2/2/24, 12:28 am - James: Not conference pretender
2/2/24, 12:28 am - Gerrard: He set up a Solanke goal lol
2/2/24, 12:28 am - James: Didn't see it
2/2/24, 12:28 am - James: Solanke will be a good Wilson replacement
2/2/24, 12:30 am - Gerrard: Are you persisting with thinking players want to go to Newtle?
2/2/24, 12:30 am - James: Are you persisting on Alfonso to varpy?
2/2/24, 12:31 am - James: Salad to Saudi in summer?
2/2/24, 12:31 am - James: Here's a Jono prediction
2/2/24, 12:31 am - James: Salsy to Saudi
2/2/24, 12:31 am - James: Alfonso to varpy
2/2/24, 12:31 am - James: And he'll bring wirtz with him
2/2/24, 1:18 am - Jono: JT is a proper twat hey
2/2/24, 1:27 am - Jono: https://x.com/JonnyGabriel/status/1752984382137340416?s=20
2/2/24, 1:33 am - James: Note to all professional footballers... Leave your outlets with the switches on. If they're off when you get home, your wife is having an affair with John Terry
2/2/24, 1:33 am - Gerrard: Lol
2/2/24, 1:34 am - James: Good that one wasn't it
2/2/24, 3:14 am - Jono: Anyone hear about this?
2/2/24, 3:15 am - Jono: Could be the end of VAR given the verdict
2/2/24, 3:18 am - Gerrard: Do It
2/2/24, 3:19 am - Gerrard: I would love to hear @14244893404 rant if we won the league after a VAR replay court case, better than a pandemic rant
2/2/24, 3:46 am - James: Nothing wrong with var
2/2/24, 3:46 am - James: Just the people operating it
2/2/24, 3:46 am - James: Get the automated offside system in that's already available
2/2/24, 3:46 am - Gerrard: The rules set in place
2/2/24, 3:46 am - Gerrard: Clear and obvious is cooked
2/2/24, 3:47 am - James: And AI is so good, probably can have that decide everything on the field eventually
2/2/24, 3:47 am - James: No more varsenpool
2/2/24, 3:47 am - Gerrard: Ref got it wrong should be the indicator to get look at something
2/2/24, 3:48 am - James: The var operators in the Varpool game should have just told the ref what happened and he could have told the captain of each team and let Varpool score a goal
2/2/24, 3:49 am - Gerrard: WWDCD
2/2/24, 3:49 am - Jono: Interesting if we lose the league by a point… how that moment will be perceived
2/2/24, 3:49 am - James: Too much bias in refs and the operators
2/2/24, 3:49 am - Gerrard: What Would Di Canio Do <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 3:49 am - Pero: https://youtu.be/b2ce_PZhVe0?si=MQdaStdRXF1kSl_2

What timing for this video 😅
2/2/24, 3:49 am - James: Could lose someone a cup final for example
2/2/24, 3:49 am - Jono: Just means the ruling in Belgium will now be explored by others given how it played out in the PL <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 3:50 am - James: Won't happen. Imagine the result hinges on spurs getting CL
2/2/24, 3:50 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 They go a point about the undefeated thing eh
2/2/24, 3:50 am - James: Too many variables now. Ship sailed
2/2/24, 3:50 am - Jono: Not saying this season, but future seasons
2/2/24, 3:50 am - James: Victims. Would never hear the end of it
2/2/24, 3:51 am - Jono: Precedence set in Belgium
2/2/24, 3:51 am - Jono: Open season now
2/2/24, 3:51 am - James: Varpools to lose now. Have a healthy lead and Citeh at home left
2/2/24, 3:51 am - Jono: For future examples
2/2/24, 3:52 am - James: They love that
2/2/24, 3:54 am - James: Wait till Varsenal lose out on CL
2/2/24, 3:55 am - James: Will be demanding the Newcastle game replayed because big Joe made a bitch outta Gabriel
2/2/24, 3:55 am - James: How can someone so big be such a weak bitch @61409710717
2/2/24, 3:55 am - James: Cuck
2/2/24, 3:58 am - Pero: Invincible 🫶
2/2/24, 3:59 am - Pero: The livo fan with the black hat is dead set Ty's counterpart
2/2/24, 4:02 am - James: They lost to chicken Kiev?
2/2/24, 4:02 am - James: And thumped by the shit Milan
2/2/24, 4:02 am - James: Fake milan
2/2/24, 4:08 am - Gerrard: Thanks
2/2/24, 5:09 am - Dave: This 100%. Too much wiggle room for human error and inconsistencies are what is driving everyone crazy - not the tech itself. If the rules were clear and all officials abided by them, there would be no debates or outrage
2/2/24, 5:10 am - James: Rules are clear. Just too many Varpool and Mancs in the operating rooms
2/2/24, 5:11 am - Dave: 100%. Easy run of fixtures left as well and running on pure emotion now the gaffer is leaving. Liverpool have this one in the bag
2/2/24, 5:13 am - James: Years of mediocrity once he goes you think?
2/2/24, 5:13 am - James: Have to rebuild. They'll be crying into their gruel for at least a season
2/2/24, 5:13 am - Dave: Na, they’re getting Xabi mate. Be like Klopp never left
2/2/24, 5:14 am - James: Xabi guardiola
2/2/24, 5:15 am - Dave: Xabi and gerrard at the wheel. Liverpool legend dream team
2/2/24, 5:16 am - James: Strange someone would actually want to move back to Liverpool having had to be there  to play for them years ago. Leverkusen must be a shithole
2/2/24, 5:17 am - James: Like Houllier and the other fella
2/2/24, 5:17 am - James: Or Falglish and Barnes
2/2/24, 5:21 am - Dave: Heard it could be de zerbi or Ange as well
2/2/24, 5:22 am - Dave: All great managers, would be happy to have any of them if I was a Liverpool fan
2/2/24, 5:23 am - James: Ange done more than de zerbi
2/2/24, 5:24 am - James: Won trophies
2/2/24, 5:24 am - James: I love the way Ange is so aussie and says 'mate' all the time 😍
2/2/24, 5:25 am - James: Bet he roasts a cracker shrimp
2/2/24, 5:26 am - Dave: Milks it hard doesn’t he
2/2/24, 5:26 am - James: Type of guy you'd trust around your kids. Varpool would be mad to overlook him
2/2/24, 5:29 am - James: Got that friendly school bus driver kinda vibe
2/2/24, 5:29 am - James: Alfonso looks like the type of guy who'd reject your mortgage application <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 5:34 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 can't be bothered reading Clickbaits messages, what's going on?
2/2/24, 8:08 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2z1ZXFMqJ-/?igsh=eDA5aTM2cDBldXc=
2/2/24, 8:14 am - James: Bad spell has pretty much been his entire career minus his last season at Benfica?
2/2/24, 8:15 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/tt4vdNF2sLo?si=oD1FWQDWJXY4txR_
Not brave enough to give the youngsters a chance.
2/2/24, 8:15 am - Gerrard: Did Sherar play for Benfica???
2/2/24, 8:15 am - James: What youngsters?
2/2/24, 8:16 am - Gerrard: Exactly <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 8:16 am - James: What a miss that is. Shame on you. Like nunezezy
2/2/24, 8:16 am - James: Ian Wright was overrated
2/2/24, 8:17 am - Gerrard: Alan Sherar
2/2/24, 8:18 am - James: 'He-Man' making sure you know his pronouns. Very progressive for back then
2/2/24, 8:18 am - Gerrard: Lol
2/2/24, 8:18 am - James: @61409710717 Wright overrated?
2/2/24, 8:19 am - James: Was more a tap in merchant
2/2/24, 8:19 am - Gerrard: I only seen him cry at that old man
2/2/24, 8:19 am - James: Never scored bangers
2/2/24, 8:19 am - James: Never made goals himself
2/2/24, 8:19 am - Gerrard: I thot U waz ded
2/2/24, 8:19 am - James: Was all Bergkampsy
2/2/24, 8:20 am - James: I remember he tried to break schimichels (can't spell it) leg in a 1-on-1
2/2/24, 8:20 am - James: Stamped on it as he rushed out of goal
2/2/24, 8:20 am - Gerrard: That's two things now, I couldn't name a legendary Arsenal striker or a legendary Arsenal midfielder.
Henry and Berger were wing/forwards, right?
2/2/24, 8:21 am - James: Patrick Berger
2/2/24, 8:21 am - Gerrard: Nah that other lesser known player
2/2/24, 8:21 am - Gerrard: Mein Kampf
2/2/24, 8:21 am - James: Beegsy was a withdrawn forward
2/2/24, 8:22 am - James: Like a 10 before 10s
2/2/24, 8:22 am - Gerrard: The only player of note is Cashley Cole
2/2/24, 8:22 am - Gerrard: And he ditched em
2/2/24, 8:23 am - Gerrard: Like proper legendary players <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 8:23 am - James: I was at the game bwegamp scored an absolute worldy v Leicester
2/2/24, 8:23 am - Gerrard: I'm struggling
2/2/24, 8:23 am - James: I'll try find it
2/2/24, 8:23 am - Gerrard: Deep dive the web

2/2/24, 8:24 am - James: Unfortunately wengy talks at start
2/2/24, 8:24 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 your mate is back
2/2/24, 8:24 am - James: Just skip to end
2/2/24, 8:25 am - Gerrard: Kinda like Matt Let Tissier
2/2/24, 8:25 am - Gerrard: Must be his role model
2/2/24, 8:26 am - Gerrard: Ew that pedo is at the end too
2/2/24, 8:26 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 imagine supporting Arsenal
2/2/24, 8:27 am - James: I was at the opposite end of the ground. Couldn't understand what happened
2/2/24, 8:27 am - James: I was also at the game when Neil Lennon headbutted Shearers boot
2/2/24, 8:27 am - James: Hold on
2/2/24, 8:27 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 imagine Newty started a fan channel like AFTV, you'd fucking neck yourself
2/2/24, 8:28 am - James: https://youtu.be/C8fMbxLTpps?feature=shared
2/2/24, 8:28 am - Dave: Wow. So toxic
2/2/24, 8:28 am - Dave: Joking about suicide now. Disgusting
2/2/24, 8:28 am - James: Dunno what Lennon was playing at <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 8:28 am - Jono: Bergkamp was easily my favourite non LFC player in the 90s
2/2/24, 8:28 am - Jono: Fucking hell what a player
2/2/24, 8:29 am - Gerrard: Of course he is
2/2/24, 8:29 am - Gerrard: Yeeowza
2/2/24, 8:29 am - Jono: Haha shearer
2/2/24, 8:29 am - James: He isn't Mexican
2/2/24, 8:29 am - James: Senior Bergkamp
2/2/24, 8:29 am - Jono: They brought that up in the podcast
2/2/24, 8:29 am - Jono: A few mths back. He doesn’t like talking about it
2/2/24, 8:29 am - James: Probably
2/2/24, 8:30 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 imagine you supporting a team that claims they were never defeated in a year that their most bitter rivals knocked them out of a Champions league quarter final.
2/2/24, 8:30 am - James: Ah it missed the bit David Batty throws Lennon off the pitch so the game can resume
2/2/24, 8:31 am - James: What was that?
2/2/24, 8:34 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I can't believe Conor Bradley has so quickly surpassed Ben White  as a rightback
2/2/24, 8:34 am - James: I don't know who that is but I don't rate Ben White. That is all
2/2/24, 8:35 am - James: Wonder what White did on England duty
2/2/24, 8:35 am - James: Never playing for England again
2/2/24, 8:36 am - James: He's only behind Trips, Trent, walker, James, Livramento, wan bissaka anyway
2/2/24, 8:44 am - Gerrard: Lucky for him Connor Bradley is Northern Irish
2/2/24, 8:45 am - Gerrard: And I guess Zinky only gets a start for Ukraine because all the real men are there fighting the war
2/2/24, 8:56 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 let's play a game....
2/2/24, 9:21 am - Gerrard: Do these seem good?
2/2/24, 9:35 am - James: Depends for which team
2/2/24, 9:35 am - James: For Crystal Palace, yes
2/2/24, 9:35 am - Gerrard: Well their fans say they're title challengers
2/2/24, 9:36 am - Gerrard: Now I think these two are more impressive... <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 9:36 am - James: Top scorer has 8
2/2/24, 9:36 am - James: 7
2/2/24, 9:36 am - James: Wilson has 7 and he's missed most the season lol
2/2/24, 10:37 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2zRgscg17l/?igsh=MTgydndmYzc3NzcwZA==
2/2/24, 11:20 am - James: The Emirates woodwork is thankful
2/2/24, 11:20 am - James: At least the fans in row A behind the goal won't need to bring their face shields too

@61452662705
3/2/24, 2:01 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Arsenal fans mustn't be able to walk through the water and soft drinks aisle in Coles and Woolies without getting triggered
3/2/24, 2:03 am - Gerrard: Keown is proper rattled
3/2/24, 4:16 am - James: Lots of injuries. Viera, Marquinhos, Partey 😂
3/2/24, 4:17 am - James: He said timber who hasn't played as well
3/2/24, 4:25 am - Dave: Is 40 big chances missed and hitting the woodwork 14 times just considered “bad luck” Klopp? 😂😂 fuck me I want whatever he’s smoking
3/2/24, 4:26 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 so triggered
3/2/24, 4:26 am - Dave: Viera and partey are v important players
3/2/24, 4:27 am - Dave: Looking forward to him recovering. Going to be one of the best defenders in the league if his ACL doesn’t give him long term issues 🤞
3/2/24, 1:57 pm - James: Everton are dreadful
3/2/24, 1:58 pm - James: Take another 10pts off them and get rid
3/2/24, 9:12 pm - Liam: Was this comment sent before or after newty let 4 goals in at home against luton?
3/2/24, 9:22 pm - Jono: Beat me to it @61478754484
3/2/24, 9:23 pm - Jono: 4️⃣
3/2/24, 9:24 pm - Jono: How about letting in quadruples vs the LT at your fake fortress?
3/2/24, 9:47 pm - Dave: Coming back with RECEIPTS. Love it 👊 💪😂😂

3/2/24, 10:10 pm - Jono: This song playing in my head while searching for receipts
4/2/24, 2:27 am - James: Good team Luton. Will deffo stay up
4/2/24, 2:27 am - James: The fella at left back is shit
4/2/24, 2:40 am - James: @61409710717 think Rodders ejaculated that he has 24 hrs before he gets massive abuse
4/2/24, 2:40 am - James: @61409710717 even this cunt made an appearance
4/2/24, 4:01 am - Gerrard: He's your mate <This message was edited>
4/2/24, 4:01 am - Gerrard: Resurgence
4/2/24, 4:05 am - Jono: Even buttfucked Chelsea are gonna finish above Newtle
4/2/24, 4:05 am - James: @61409710717 your mate is obsessed with Newcastle
4/2/24, 4:06 am - James: Newcastle and shit Mexican footballers
4/2/24, 4:07 am - Liam: Did you watch it live?
4/2/24, 4:08 am - Jono: Mid table slogs aren’t worth staying up for by Feb
4/2/24, 4:09 am - James: Must have been wank for you last season then. Who did you watch?
4/2/24, 4:09 am - James: Yeah cracker game
4/2/24, 4:10 am - James: Are you going to stay up and watch varsenpool?
4/2/24, 4:10 am - Liam: Mini match was a great watch
4/2/24, 4:10 am - Liam: God no
4/2/24, 4:11 am - Liam: Gordon might be the best left forward this year in the PL
4/2/24, 4:11 am - James: Shame he's injured
4/2/24, 4:11 am - James: Barnes comes back, Gordon out
4/2/24, 4:12 am - Liam: Confined injured?
4/2/24, 4:12 am - James: Yup
4/2/24, 4:12 am - Liam: Because he’s been great
4/2/24, 4:12 am - James: Shame he won't go to euros at the expense of Rashford
4/2/24, 4:12 am - James: Saka, Gordon and Kane
4/2/24, 4:13 am - James: Bellingham behind
4/2/24, 4:13 am - James: Coming home
4/2/24, 4:14 am - Liam: I’d be trying to find a space for Palmer
4/2/24, 4:14 am - James: He'll probably miss a pen
4/2/24, 5:17 am - Gerrard: What is happening in here today?
@61452662705
4/2/24, 5:28 am - James: Your Mexican mate piping up
4/2/24, 5:29 am - James: Liam appeared
4/2/24, 5:29 am - James: Rodwell thinks the attention is off him
4/2/24, 5:29 am - Gerrard: Yeah, he does that a lot.
4/2/24, 5:29 am - Gerrard: a wild Liam appears
4/2/24, 5:30 am - James: Think it'll be quiet in here tomorrow from one section or the other
4/2/24, 5:31 am - James: I'll be here though 🔫
4/2/24, 5:31 am - Gerrard: I'll be talking either way, don't you worry, buddy?
4/2/24, 5:35 am - Liam: I promise I’ll show up for a bit
4/2/24, 5:35 am - James: You will. Your mate will go silent though
4/2/24, 5:35 am - James: Fighting talk
4/2/24, 5:35 am - James: What you thinking Liam?
4/2/24, 5:35 am - James: Arsey win?
4/2/24, 5:35 am - Liam: Can’t say I actually care this Season
4/2/24, 5:35 am - James: Must win game
4/2/24, 5:35 am - Gerrard: I'll be going hard in the group chat because I know even if Arsenal win, they're still bottle jobs.
4/2/24, 5:37 am - Liam: Ya I agree, arsenal will bottle it. Striker, 2 midfielders and Defender short of even being in the conversation.
4/2/24, 5:38 am - Liam: Looking forward to CL games
4/2/24, 5:38 am - Liam: League I’m happy with top 4
4/2/24, 5:38 am - Gerrard: truth
4/2/24, 5:38 am - Liam: Hopefully the others continue to fuck up more than us <This message was edited>
4/2/24, 5:39 am - Dave: Yup. Liverpools to lose now. They’ve as good as won the league
4/2/24, 5:39 am - Gerrard: Well, it's borderline if you're going to be happy come the end of the season then.
4/2/24, 5:40 am - Gerrard: I'd never call it this early, but I see where you're coming from.
4/2/24, 5:42 am - Liam: It’s a bit boring to watch us play this season.
4/2/24, 5:43 am - Gerrard: I heard from other Arsenal fans that it's more relief at the end of the game and not celebration.
4/2/24, 5:44 am - Liam: Ya we literally have full control of games.
4/2/24, 5:44 am - Liam: But it’s just boring
4/2/24, 5:44 am - Liam: Last year we had more pace to our game
4/2/24, 5:44 am - Gerrard: That's not what I heard. I heard you guys control the first half and if you don't score, then you're not going to win.
4/2/24, 5:45 am - Liam: Normall full control
4/2/24, 5:45 am - Gerrard: I heard Declan rice is slowing down the progress play and not playing the ball forward quick enough.
4/2/24, 5:45 am - Liam: Than a long ball over zinny head and they score
4/2/24, 5:46 am - Liam: Or a shitty corner
4/2/24, 5:46 am - Liam: Ya this happens
4/2/24, 5:47 am - Liam: He not good on the half turn
4/2/24, 5:47 am - Gerrard: That statistic that you guys had a few weeks ago of not scoring a lot of goals from open Play is concerning.
4/2/24, 5:48 am - Liam: Not concern I think they will bring in a 6 and 9 in the summer
4/2/24, 5:48 am - Gerrard: But Arsenal fans are saying he's the best player in the team this year.
4/2/24, 5:48 am - Liam: But it’s just boring until then
4/2/24, 5:48 am - Liam: He is great, going to be a killer when he’s not the 6
4/2/24, 5:48 am - Liam: Love him
4/2/24, 5:48 am - Gerrard: I'll send you boys the Sky Sports choosing best 11 out of Arsenal Liverpool with the Arsenal guys. Trying to get Gabriel. Hey Zeus into it.
4/2/24, 5:49 am - Liam: Partey just made of glass and fucking shit up
4/2/24, 5:52 am - Liam: Allison, TAA, saliba, Gabriel, Robinson. Would be my back 5
4/2/24, 5:54 am - Gerrard: I think you'd have to look at yourself. If you're choosing Gabriel over Van d.
4/2/24, 6:00 am - Liam: He’s been better than saliba
4/2/24, 6:05 am - Gerrard: Can you send me a photo of that surprised face you do so I can send it back to you for that comment
4/2/24, 6:06 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 would you take Gabriel?
4/2/24, 6:07 am - James: No
4/2/24, 6:07 am - James: Saliba yeah
4/2/24, 6:07 am - Gerrard: Yeah
4/2/24, 6:07 am - Dave: Wouldn’t agree with that. We won our last game in the second half. 

Agree with what Liam says, we’re just boring to watch. We grind down teams rather than overwhelm them like we did last season. Except we don’t have the form up top to get it in the back when needed
4/2/24, 6:07 am - Gerrard: Excuse me, I was talking to my friend Liam
4/2/24, 6:07 am - Dave: Will you take a day off being a cunt
4/2/24, 6:08 am - Gerrard: I don't know who you are or what you're talking about
4/2/24, 6:09 am - Dave: 💯
4/2/24, 6:10 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/M4r2NkTtaco?si=4mF3AKutiXSdTzXx
4/2/24, 6:11 am - Gerrard: Ali
Taa Saliba vvd Gomez(because Robbo was out)
Declan
Odee Jones
Salah Nunez Jota
4/2/24, 6:11 am - Gerrard: You can't put up the Arsenal forwards against the Livo forwards this season
4/2/24, 6:11 am - Liam: Rice as 6 is shit
4/2/24, 6:12 am - Gerrard: That's his role innit
4/2/24, 6:12 am - Liam: No ones getting past him
4/2/24, 6:12 am - Liam: But can’t progress the ball fast enough
4/2/24, 6:13 am - Gerrard: You want Mac or Endo then?
4/2/24, 6:13 am - James: Rive is just a glorified David Batty
4/2/24, 6:13 am - James: Side to side
4/2/24, 6:13 am - Gerrard: OR
TAA and get Connor Bradley in at RB
4/2/24, 6:13 am - James: No white?
4/2/24, 6:13 am - James: What about Benjamin
4/2/24, 6:13 am - Gerrard: No fucking way
4/2/24, 6:14 am - Gerrard: Who's this?
4/2/24, 6:14 am - James: Benjamin White init
4/2/24, 6:14 am - Gerrard: Netanyahu?
4/2/24, 6:14 am - James: Varsenal have lots of injuries
4/2/24, 6:14 am - Gerrard: Solid defender
4/2/24, 6:14 am - James: Viera and Marquinhos are out
4/2/24, 6:14 am - Gerrard: Who are they?
4/2/24, 6:15 am - James: Vital according to keown
4/2/24, 6:15 am - James: Why they are struggling
4/2/24, 6:15 am - James: Patrick Viera has more influence on this current team than the one they bought
4/2/24, 6:15 am - Gerrard: *insert Liam's surprise face photo
4/2/24, 6:15 am - Dave: Liverpool going to win about 7-0 tomorrow then going off this chat
4/2/24, 6:16 am - James: Jordon said it was title challengers vs bottlers
4/2/24, 6:16 am - Gerrard: If that happens just exit the group
4/2/24, 6:16 am - James: I put Jota in my fpl
4/2/24, 6:16 am - James: Took Saka out @61409710717
4/2/24, 6:16 am - Gerrard: At least @61413646755 had the balls to stay and take his medicine
4/2/24, 6:16 am - Liam: Allison or Trent long ball over zinny head tomorrow
4/2/24, 6:16 am - Gerrard: Smart play for points innit
4/2/24, 6:16 am - James: Ukrainian Dan Burn
4/2/24, 6:17 am - James: Though zinny should be fighting for his country
4/2/24, 6:17 am - James: Coward
4/2/24, 6:17 am - Gerrard: I'm thinking it'll be chaos Nunez and Jota that show up
4/2/24, 6:17 am - James: Could be 8
4/2/24, 6:17 am - Dave: Actually dreading that lol
4/2/24, 6:17 am - Liam: Why do you have to bring race into this
4/2/24, 6:17 am - Dave: Zinny our weak link this season man
4/2/24, 6:17 am - Dave: Gets skinned every fucking match
4/2/24, 6:17 am - James: Yeah he's shit
4/2/24, 6:17 am - James: We said last season
4/2/24, 6:17 am - James: Pep ain't no mug
4/2/24, 6:17 am - Dave: Klopp will overwhelm that right wing tomorrow <This message was edited>
4/2/24, 6:18 am - James: He'd rather play a CB at left back than zinny
4/2/24, 6:18 am - James: Blood bath
4/2/24, 6:18 am - Dave: Zinny is like Trent but half the player going forward
4/2/24, 6:18 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I know Rodders loves IFs - if Nunez got a Crouchy Hattrick, do you think their tune would change on him?
4/2/24, 6:18 am - James: He's better than what they have
4/2/24, 6:19 am - Dave: I’m probably the most positive about Nunez in this group other than you Liverpool fans
4/2/24, 6:19 am - James: Gordon and Isak are better
4/2/24, 6:19 am - Gerrard: Stats don't lie <This message was edited>
4/2/24, 6:19 am - Dave: I’d have him at Arsenal in a heartbeat
4/2/24, 6:19 am - James: Varsenal will have to sell in summer
4/2/24, 6:19 am - James: Best to offload martinelli
4/2/24, 6:19 am - Gerrard: I think they all are.
Diaz Salah Nunez Jota
4/2/24, 6:19 am - James: His heard isn't in it
4/2/24, 6:19 am - Dave: I still think Nunez was a poor signing at £85m
4/2/24, 6:20 am - James: Heart
4/2/24, 6:20 am - Dave: But we paid £67m for Havertz so who are we to laugh
4/2/24, 6:20 am - James: Gakpo
4/2/24, 6:20 am - James: Slobby is better
4/2/24, 6:20 am - Gerrard: And Elliot not far behind Saka
4/2/24, 6:20 am - Liam: I would love Nunez upfront
4/2/24, 6:21 am - James: Varsenal should sign solanke or watkins
4/2/24, 6:21 am - James: But they are broke
4/2/24, 6:21 am - Gerrard: If Saka and Martinelli don't step up then there's 3 open spots in that forward line
4/2/24, 6:21 am - Dave: We need a player like isak more than Jesus. Wouldn’t say Gordon is better than in-form martinelli
4/2/24, 6:21 am - James: We'll see
4/2/24, 6:21 am - Dave: Same. Would really open up back line for rest of lads to bang them in
4/2/24, 6:22 am - James: You soad Gordon was shit
4/2/24, 6:22 am - Gerrard: When was he last in form?
4/2/24, 6:22 am - Dave: Jesus is on his arse or skying it half the time
4/2/24, 6:22 am - Dave: Last season
4/2/24, 6:22 am - Dave: lol
4/2/24, 6:22 am - James: £40m a snip
4/2/24, 6:22 am - James: We said he wasn't as good as you thought last season
4/2/24, 6:23 am - James: Pep no mug
4/2/24, 6:23 am - Liam: Jesus from the wing like pep played him
4/2/24, 6:23 am - James: Jesus doesn't know what he is
4/2/24, 6:23 am - Gerrard: Feel bad for him, left City to not play on the wing
4/2/24, 6:23 am - Dave: If Jesus would take a sub role as backup for wings I’d be keen on keeping him
4/2/24, 6:23 am - James: Cryteta lies
4/2/24, 6:23 am - Dave: But he wants to be main man
4/2/24, 6:23 am - Gerrard: Trying to be Firmino
4/2/24, 6:24 am - Dave: If I was arteta, I’d offload Jesus, Eddie, zinny, partey and one of the keepers
4/2/24, 6:24 am - James: Watkins, Isak, Wilson, Nunez, Solanke, Richardson, Hoijland all better
4/2/24, 6:24 am - James: Gakpo
4/2/24, 6:24 am - James: Jota
4/2/24, 6:24 am - Dave: In that role, I agree
4/2/24, 6:25 am - Gerrard: One year looking a solid 11 and next year needing a rebuild
4/2/24, 6:25 am - James: @61409710717 think Arsenal at their level. 4th best. Or maybe 5th best with spurs?
4/2/24, 6:25 am - Gerrard: Gotta ask questions of Arteta
4/2/24, 6:25 am - Dave: Jesus is an incredible player. But we need an efficient striker.
4/2/24, 6:25 am - James: They were going to win the league in August
4/2/24, 6:25 am - James: Before a ball was kicked
4/2/24, 6:26 am - Liam: Newty were going to win the CL in August
4/2/24, 6:26 am - Gerrard: I think last year was their chance, if they had some experienced players like a Milner in the room, they might have got across the line.
4/2/24, 6:27 am - Liam: We could be 2 point off top tomorrow
4/2/24, 6:27 am - Liam: Newty came last in the cl group
4/2/24, 6:27 am - Liam: And let 4 in against luton
4/2/24, 6:27 am - Liam: At home
4/2/24, 6:28 am - Dave: The “we beat PSG” cup
4/2/24, 6:28 am - Gerrard: Winning the CL gets you into the next CL, might be the path
4/2/24, 6:28 am - Liam: With the best defence in the league
4/2/24, 6:28 am - Gerrard: Whoa this is turning here, thought we were having a decent chat about football
4/2/24, 6:28 am - Dave: Wish we’d kept xhaka. Dumbest move in the world letting him go. Look at leverkusen now, he’s key there.
4/2/24, 6:28 am - Dave: @61452662705 started it
4/2/24, 6:28 am - Liam: Liverpool are not even in the CL
4/2/24, 6:28 am - Gerrard: Wow
4/2/24, 6:29 am - Liam: Playing random clubs in Ukraine instead <This message was edited>
4/2/24, 6:29 am - Gerrard: Certainly not a Gentleman anymore, Mr Liam
4/2/24, 6:29 am - Gerrard: I'm starting to hear something, do you hear it.....?
4/2/24, 6:29 am - Liam: Facts
4/2/24, 6:30 am - James: They can't help it
4/2/24, 6:30 am - James: They're pathetic @61409710717
4/2/24, 6:30 am - James: Rattle city
4/2/24, 6:30 am - Liam: This
4/2/24, 6:31 am - Gerrard: So if we're all about Truth then admit that Arsenal are BottleJobs
4/2/24, 6:31 am - Dave: I would say Liam and I were being vulnerable talking about Arsenal’s weaknesses and you threw this grenade into the chat 🤷‍♂️
4/2/24, 6:31 am - Dave: We bottled it last season
4/2/24, 6:31 am - Liam: Undeniable
4/2/24, 6:32 am - James: You said that
4/2/24, 6:32 am - James: Then you made up stuff I said
4/2/24, 6:32 am - James: Liam's words at cbh were they were going to win the league
4/2/24, 6:32 am - James: When he got excited he met an arsenal fan
4/2/24, 6:32 am - Gerrard: And the seasons before that?
4/2/24, 6:32 am - Dave: Ok. So say Liam. Not THEY
4/2/24, 6:32 am - James: @61409710717 why they like this
4/2/24, 6:33 am - James: Same person in my eyes
4/2/24, 6:33 am - Liam: Just enjoying the moment
4/2/24, 6:33 am - Gerrard: What pronouns do you prefer?
4/2/24, 6:33 am - Liam: Being a proper fan
4/2/24, 6:33 am - Dave: It’s like me saying “all Newcastle fans” after watching a true Geordie vid
4/2/24, 6:33 am - Dave: Unless he represents you @61452662705. Just let me know ❤️
4/2/24, 6:34 am - Dave: Which seasons?
4/2/24, 6:34 am - Gerrard: 5th?
4/2/24, 6:34 am - Dave: And what’s the definition of bottle? Because you lads have your fair share as well
4/2/24, 6:34 am - Gerrard: 8th?
4/2/24, 6:34 am - Gerrard: 8th?
4/2/24, 6:34 am - Dave: Not sure how 8th constitutes a bottle
4/2/24, 6:34 am - Gerrard: Again changing the topic, @61452662705 <This message was edited>
4/2/24, 6:34 am - Dave: A bottle from what? 7th? 😂
4/2/24, 6:36 am - Gerrard: You guys were much higher then towards the end of each season you drop multiple positions because you couldn't see it out.
4/2/24, 6:36 am - Dave: Last season was the definition of a bottle, totally agree
4/2/24, 6:36 am - Gerrard: And the season before
4/2/24, 6:36 am - Gerrard: I'll let you say the two 8ths aren't, cool <This message was edited>
4/2/24, 6:37 am - Gerrard: Missing out on top four at the end was a bottle too, you're not denying that - right? <This message was edited>
4/2/24, 6:37 am - Dave: My definition of a bottle is crashing out of a tournament at the last hurdle to a lesser opponent or not getting a title when you’ve got a significant lead and run of form
4/2/24, 6:38 am - Gerrard: Then you're different than everyone in the world of football
4/2/24, 6:38 am - Dave: Like I think Newcastle bottled energy cup because they were a far better team than United at the time and should have run them over
4/2/24, 6:38 am - Gerrard: Everyone has been calling Arsenal bottle jobs since Arteta took over
4/2/24, 6:38 am - Gerrard: Nah that wasn't a bottle
4/2/24, 6:39 am - Gerrard: Really didn't belong there, that was really good of them to get that close.
4/2/24, 6:39 am - Dave: I guess? If that was a clear target of the club?
4/2/24, 6:39 am - Dave: Did you bottle top 4 last season?
4/2/24, 6:39 am - Gerrard: Nah we were never in it, trouble from the start
4/2/24, 6:39 am - Dave: I wouldn’t have called that a bottle. But ultimately you were expected to get top 4 and you didn’t
4/2/24, 6:39 am - Gerrard: Just missed out
4/2/24, 6:40 am - Gerrard: We were never in it
4/2/24, 6:40 am - Gerrard: Arsenal were sitting pretty in the top 4 then lost a bunch of games at the end
4/2/24, 6:40 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 am I speaking a different language???
4/2/24, 6:41 am - Dave: Of course you were. You’re liverpool.
Second biggest club in the country. You were always in it. Liverpool aren’t in it until it’s mathematically impossible
4/2/24, 6:41 am - Dave: Like city
4/2/24, 6:41 am - Gerrard: We weren't in the top 4, we were 12th and got to 5th - are you stoned?
4/2/24, 6:42 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 is your mate for real?
4/2/24, 6:45 am - Dave: Sooooo. If you’d beaten Villa and beaten Southampton in your last two games of the season, you wouldn’t have got top 4?
4/2/24, 6:46 am - Dave: You choked on your last two games. Could have won them and taken Newtys fourth spot. You didn’t. 🤷‍♂️
4/2/24, 7:13 am - Gerrard: You've gone weird mate
4/2/24, 7:14 am - James: 😲
4/2/24, 7:21 am - Dave: 🪇
4/2/24, 7:29 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 🫣
4/2/24, 8:14 am - James: They bottling this group chat too?
4/2/24, 8:26 am - Jono: Over 200 messages who rattled who in the what?
4/2/24, 8:29 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 as the neutral party this weekend, who's rattled?
4/2/24, 8:30 am - James: I think Liamsy made an appearance because he wanted to try sledge me because he knows tomorrow morning is going to be HELL
4/2/24, 8:30 am - Jono: Hope for the sake of this chat it doesn’t end in a boring draw tomorrow
4/2/24, 8:30 am - James: And Rodwell was just trying to shift attention to me instead of him for once
4/2/24, 8:31 am - Jono: I’ll take the L just to see the goonbags jizz again for the 🏆
4/2/24, 8:32 am - Jono: We’re due an L… fuck me. Only 1 all season 😅
4/2/24, 8:32 am - Jono: We were meant to be fucked apparently
4/2/24, 8:33 am - James: @61409710717 and I think your mate is apprehensive about tomorrow as well
4/2/24, 8:33 am - Jono: I have my feelings
4/2/24, 8:33 am - Jono: Not worth expressing on ere
4/2/24, 8:33 am - James: Thank you
4/2/24, 8:34 am - Gerrard: I don't let in the negative vibes anymore
4/2/24, 8:34 am - Jono: Need some hot Jota sauce
4/2/24, 8:34 am - James: Too many of them over things you can control
4/2/24, 8:34 am - James: Can't control the football
4/2/24, 8:35 am - James: He's in my FPL
4/2/24, 8:35 am - James: Ready to go
4/2/24, 8:35 am - Jono: Jota loves zee emirates
4/2/24, 8:35 am - Gerrard: Think he's in everyone's from hearing the football team lads today
4/2/24, 8:35 am - Jono: I was watching highlights of a game the other day where the stadium was half empty and Suarez scored
4/2/24, 8:35 am - James: Absolute killing Rodwell in that btw
4/2/24, 8:35 am - James: He doesn't know ball
4/2/24, 8:36 am - Jono: I thought it might have been a pre season game
4/2/24, 8:36 am - James: I even have Trent
4/2/24, 8:37 am - Dave: Had a rough first month, been playing catch up all season
4/2/24, 8:37 am - James: It's over
4/2/24, 8:37 am - James: To the point you copy my team by the looks of it
4/2/24, 8:37 am - Dave: Managed to get off the bottom to 4th-6th in leagues I’m in
4/2/24, 8:38 am - Dave: Haven’t even looked at your team once. It’s just you and I in that league because no one else joined, I didn’t even know you were beating me 😂😂😂
4/2/24, 8:39 am - James: Sure buddy. Getting smashed @61409710717
4/2/24, 8:40 am - James: @61409710717 he's bottling it
4/2/24, 8:40 am - Dave: Must have hurt that. You’re waking up with a chub checking that two team league every morning and I forgot it even existed
4/2/24, 8:40 am - James: Last I looked was in November
4/2/24, 8:40 am - Dave: Got to win something this season hey James
4/2/24, 8:40 am - James: When I was 200 pts ahead
4/2/24, 8:40 am - James: Have you caught up?
4/2/24, 8:40 am - Dave: Change of tune. Thought I was copying your team?
4/2/24, 8:40 am - James: I looked this morning tbf
4/2/24, 8:40 am - James: Wanted to see
4/2/24, 8:41 am - Gerrard: Did you pick a lot of Arsenal players?
4/2/24, 8:41 am - Dave: Unfortunately yes
4/2/24, 8:41 am - James: But I'm logged out and can't be arsed logging back in
4/2/24, 8:41 am - Gerrard: Usual
4/2/24, 8:41 am - Gerrard: Ah shucks
4/2/24, 8:41 am - Dave: My team was basically Arsenal and Newty players in first month. Didn’t bode well for me
4/2/24, 8:41 am - James: Back to Newcastle @61409710717
4/2/24, 8:42 am - Dave: Spent way too much time holding onto smelly odegaard
4/2/24, 8:42 am - James: Old one foot
4/2/24, 8:42 am - James: So overrated
4/2/24, 8:42 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 he literally can't stay on topic ever
4/2/24, 8:42 am - Dave: Honesty don’t care about Newcastle. Just bring them up to make you feel like you’re involved
4/2/24, 8:43 am - James: @61409710717 is it me or did Rodwell mate say Rice can't play as a 6?
4/2/24, 8:43 am - Jono: Just saw the Newtle game… some miserable heads in the stands when Luton got the 4th
4/2/24, 8:43 am - Gerrard: Def saw that in the chat
4/2/24, 8:43 am - James: Yeah your mate is like that
4/2/24, 8:43 am - James: Imagine them in a room together
4/2/24, 8:43 am - Gerrard: He's your mate
4/2/24, 8:43 am - Jono: Blokes play in a backyard and rock up to a 70k stadium and dominate. Legends
4/2/24, 8:43 am - James: Fuck me that would be a painful convo to listen to
4/2/24, 8:44 am - Gerrard: They'd make out at the end
4/2/24, 8:44 am - James: Couple of retards trying to fuck a door knob
4/2/24, 8:44 am - Gerrard: Jono would drown
4/2/24, 8:44 am - Jono: Where am I drowning and why?
4/2/24, 8:44 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 bring a snorkel
4/2/24, 8:45 am - Gerrard: Jimmity's mate is heavy on the saliva
4/2/24, 8:45 am - Jono: Sorry I’m not keeping up. Just watching the highlights now and providing my rolling commentary
4/2/24, 8:45 am - Jono: Is Jimmity’s mate worse than him?
4/2/24, 8:45 am - Gerrard: Pretty sure Jimmity fucks well
4/2/24, 8:46 am - Jono: Poor Gordon gonna ask for another transfer soon. He’s carrying another team but this time not in blue
4/2/24, 8:46 am - James: Are Mexicans a good shag?
4/2/24, 8:46 am - James: Bitey?
4/2/24, 8:47 am - Jono: We’re a handsy mob
4/2/24, 8:47 am - Dave: Only one mouth was open there lad. Last time I go and meet Gez in his element
4/2/24, 8:47 am - Jono: The biting was just from watching those Uruguayans who crashed in the Andes
4/2/24, 8:47 am - Jono: Inspirational
4/2/24, 8:48 am - James: Jez he's ladding you now
4/2/24, 8:48 am - Dave: Have to speak in jez language otherwise it doesn’t get through
4/2/24, 8:50 am - James: Do you know any Mexican?
4/2/24, 8:51 am - Dave: Course I do, two hour drive from border
4/2/24, 8:53 am - James: Build that wall
4/2/24, 8:57 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 you believe him or me, honest
4/2/24, 8:57 am - Gerrard: He's a toxic abuser
4/2/24, 8:57 am - James: I don't know Rodwell anymore really
4/2/24, 8:57 am - Gerrard: Sexual assault face
4/2/24, 8:58 am - James: Used to know him
4/2/24, 9:01 am - Dave: You got me, wife and kids just a front. “That night on Oxford street”
4/2/24, 11:31 am - Liam: What did I miss
4/2/24, 11:52 am - Gerrard: Rodwell came out
4/2/24, 12:06 pm - Pero: Over 300 unread messages its hot in here on the eve of the big clash. Best of luck in the morning lads, gunners need to pull a gang of special rabbits out of their ass to get a win , let's go !!
4/2/24, 6:18 pm - Jono: wtf just happened lol
4/2/24, 6:19 pm - Jono: We should be 5 down
4/2/24, 6:25 pm - Dave: Infuriating
4/2/24, 6:27 pm - Jono: Raya to blame
4/2/24, 6:28 pm - Dave: Actually think that was on saliba. Just get it out of the box
4/2/24, 6:29 pm - Dave: Raya maybe a little hesitant. But limit your risk
4/2/24, 6:31 pm - Jono: We haven’t been that dominated in a long time. But I knew only being 1 down was enough to stoke the fire 

You should’ve buried a couple more of those chances
4/2/24, 6:33 pm - Dave: We should have been at least 3/4 nil up before that happened. Don’t even think your fire has been stoked yet. Klopp will do that at half time
4/2/24, 6:33 pm - Dave: Hopefully arteta is prepared for what’s going to come out the gates
4/2/24, 6:34 pm - Jono: That Martinelli break before the 1st goal was scary
4/2/24, 6:37 pm - Dave: Was so good wasn’t it. Totally skinned konate
4/2/24, 6:42 pm - Liam: What the hell have i woke up to
4/2/24, 6:42 pm - Liam: What the fuck was that goal
4/2/24, 6:47 pm - Jono: Gabriel’s hand MOTM so far
4/2/24, 6:54 pm - Dave: HOW is that not a pen
4/2/24, 6:56 pm - Jono: Oh my
4/2/24, 7:23 pm - Dave: FOUND OUT
4/2/24, 7:23 pm - Liam: We going to win the league
4/2/24, 7:25 pm - Jono: City will win it 
They’re laughing watching this
4/2/24, 7:45 pm - Dave: They always were
4/2/24, 7:46 pm - Dave: Commiserations Jono, great game. 

Jezzy, watch those 3 minute highlights so we can laugh at you. Smeshed
4/2/24, 7:49 pm - Jono: Good win brought on by the intensity of the first 40 minutes. 

Great game but enough poor quality/lack of attacking threat from both teams to tell me City will smoke us both
4/2/24, 7:51 pm - James: What's happening @14244893404 @61404060785 finally humbled
4/2/24, 7:53 pm - James: Imagine givin it the biggun all season and getting your ass whooped like that
4/2/24, 7:53 pm - Dave: I mean. We had 7 shots on target and 5 at least should have gone in the back of the net. And we’ve beat city the last two times we’ve played them. 

Not saying we’re wining the title by any stretch of the imagination, but today was a fair result. 

City will win it. Jezzy humbled. Jono was always down to earth  🔴 ⚪️
4/2/24, 7:53 pm - James: What a start to the morning haha
4/2/24, 7:54 pm - Dave: Just thinking back to all those Arsenal players that wouldn’t make Jezzys Liverpool side last night
4/2/24, 7:54 pm - James: Did slobby play?
4/2/24, 7:56 pm - Jono: I agree but yeah, you won’t beat City at Emptyhad
4/2/24, 7:57 pm - Jono: If you do, you may just have a chance.
4/2/24, 7:57 pm - Jono: Sort of reminds me of Newy’s UCL campaign after all that work last season.
4/2/24, 7:58 pm - Jono: I had to
4/2/24, 7:58 pm - James: He's on about Newcastle again 😂
4/2/24, 7:58 pm - James: I wondered what that huge bang was this morning
4/2/24, 7:58 pm - James: @jono back down to earth 😂
4/2/24, 7:58 pm - James: 🌎
4/2/24, 8:04 pm - Dave: Of course. City will win the league.
4/2/24, 8:05 pm - Dave: And Jez still climbing out the hole he dug. Will see him in a few days or weeks I guess. Disappeared all season last year
4/2/24, 8:14 pm - James: @14244893404 no fist pumps?
4/2/24, 8:14 pm - James: How'd Nuni do?
4/2/24, 8:15 pm - Dave: Does punching the ground and grinding your Turkish teeth count?
4/2/24, 8:15 pm - Dave: 🤡
4/2/24, 8:16 pm - Gerrard: I blame Konate.
4/2/24, 8:18 pm - James: There's losing and then there's getting smeshed
4/2/24, 8:19 pm - Gerrard: You can't switch off because it's a small team and expect to just win
4/2/24, 8:22 pm - Jono: For all that dominance I’d have expected to lose by more tbh
4/2/24, 8:23 pm - Jono: We weren’t at the races today

All good. Onto the next one. Still top, for now 😅
4/2/24, 8:24 pm - Gerrard: Fair play to Arsenal, they needed to stop Liverpool from being Invincible this season
4/2/24, 8:27 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 this is like Watford all over again
4/2/24, 8:28 pm - Dave: Terrible. You’re shit. Found out “lad”
4/2/24, 8:29 pm - Dave: Jurgen ranieri crying at the end of that match. Tactical announcement before he played Arsenal
4/2/24, 8:29 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 knew he'd be classy in victory
4/2/24, 8:37 pm - Dave: Just waiting for Gabriel or saliba to issue their statement for conceding a goal to Liverpool. Pathetic
4/2/24, 8:38 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 still rattled posting the same photo twiced
4/2/24, 8:42 pm - Gerrard: It's their CL final
4/2/24, 8:52 pm - James: Ooft, what were dick van dyke and aliwallyson doing 😂
4/2/24, 8:53 pm - James: He's such a nob isn't he. Should stick to assaulting children
4/2/24, 8:57 pm - James: Clown
4/2/24, 9:20 pm - Dave: 🤡 & 🤡
4/2/24, 9:38 pm - Gerrard: I blame the purple jerseys
4/2/24, 9:38 pm - Jono: We beat them with it
4/2/24, 9:55 pm - James: Same guy who was having an orgasm when Varpool beat manure last season to move up to 7th
4/2/24, 9:56 pm - Gerrard: Double reply on a photo, woke up with a mission today
4/2/24, 10:03 pm - Jono: Speaking of missions
4/2/24, 10:39 pm - James: Take the L Johnsy
4/2/24, 10:39 pm - James: @61409710717 peas in a pod your mate and mine
4/2/24, 10:40 pm - James: Mexican peas
4/2/24, 10:58 pm - Pero: What a fantastic morning ! The game looked tense watching the mini match good showing between two heavys
4/2/24, 10:59 pm - Pero: Seemed like arteta mixed it up with more variety playing a few long balls and being more direct rather then trying to walk it in the net every other week
4/2/24, 11:01 pm - James: Absolutely embarrassed klippy mate well done Varsenal doing Gods work
4/2/24, 11:01 pm - James: What time was the game?
4/2/24, 11:03 pm - Pero: Kick off was 3.30 this morning
4/2/24, 11:06 pm - James: Cor imagine waking up to watch that and losing lol
4/2/24, 11:09 pm - Jono: Jimmity just blowing with the wind these days. Great stuff
4/2/24, 11:20 pm - Gerrard: Lol
4/2/24, 11:20 pm - Dave: Played klippety at his own game but did it way better
4/2/24, 11:20 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/vmezIIrFQmY?si=txTYpsdacwDjruW4
@61452662705
4/2/24, 11:21 pm - Gerrard: Settle down Pero, VVD gave you the game
4/2/24, 11:21 pm - Dave: Yeah if VVD hadn’t given Arsenal that one goal it would only have been 2-1!!!!
4/2/24, 11:22 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 your mate doesn't know ball thinking giving a goal away at 1-1 isn't a bad thing <This message was edited>
4/2/24, 11:27 pm - Liam: Liverpool bottled it
4/2/24, 11:29 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 the third stooge makes an appearance
4/2/24, 11:30 pm - Gerrard: Curly
4/2/24, 11:30 pm - Liam: Do you think Liverpool didn’t bottle it?
4/2/24, 11:30 pm - Gerrard: Nah Rodders is def Curly
4/2/24, 11:31 pm - Gerrard: Pero is Moe
4/2/24, 11:31 pm - Gerrard: Liam the former Gentleman is Larry
4/2/24, 11:32 pm - Liam: Should of put the boot in, killed our season and went 8 points clear
4/2/24, 11:33 pm - Gerrard: As your Arsenal "Invincibles" have shown us, you can't win every game
4/2/24, 11:40 pm - Liam: jorginho in midfield, havertz upfront…… bottle
4/2/24, 11:41 pm - Gerrard: I think that's the worst Liverpool performance of the year and Arsenal still needed VVD to hand it to them on a fuck up.
@61452662705 fair?
4/2/24, 11:41 pm - Dave: Found out. In denial
4/2/24, 11:41 pm - Liam: Look within
4/2/24, 11:42 pm - Gerrard: Here's come Curly
4/2/24, 11:42 pm - Gerrard: And Larry
4/2/24, 11:42 pm - Gerrard: Where's Moe?
4/2/24, 11:42 pm - Dave: Honestly. We all knew it, all been calling it for months
4/2/24, 11:43 pm - Jono: Happy to be corrected on this if we lose 3 or 4 this month
4/2/24, 11:43 pm - Pero: Gabriel handballing it into our own net is the biggest gift of the year 🎁
4/2/24, 11:43 pm - Jono: Like Arse last mth
4/2/24, 11:43 pm - Liam: He’s emotional, give him a few hours.
4/2/24, 11:44 pm - Jono: 1 loss though - no need to panic
4/2/24, 11:44 pm - Gerrard: Can't be emotional if I'm dead inside, right @61452662705 ?
4/2/24, 11:45 pm - Liam: https://youtube.com/shorts/773UPdMQNLs?si=LEVuavaytWSQIucn
4/2/24, 11:45 pm - Gerrard: Wait for the picture to load before posting Larry
4/2/24, 11:46 pm - Liam: @61404060785 your mate is chatting shit
4/2/24, 11:51 pm - Liam: Nice one virg 👍🏼 how about just don’t fuck up
4/2/24, 11:52 pm - Gerrard: Only human Larry
4/2/24, 11:53 pm - Jono: @61478754484 take the W
4/2/24, 11:53 pm - Jono: It may be as good as it gets
4/2/24, 11:53 pm - Gerrard: Bob, no
4/2/24, 11:53 pm - Gerrard: Don't engage Bob
4/2/24, 11:55 pm - Liam: Thanks @61404060785 🫶🏻 don’t worry Fully aware this is the peak for the season. Enjoying it
5/2/24, 12:04 am - James: Jono therapising himself in here 😂
5/2/24, 12:05 am - James: Welcome to my world
5/2/24, 12:05 am - Jono: Me 3
5/2/24, 12:05 am - Jono: Isn't this the sole purpose of this chat?
5/2/24, 12:06 am - James: No this is the antithesis of therapy
5/2/24, 12:07 am - James: Who's Larry
5/2/24, 12:14 am - Jono: Venting tool
Paying out people you never see anyway so its never awks 
Gloat factory
5/2/24, 12:14 am - Jono: All positive to me
5/2/24, 12:21 am - Gerrard: I thought group chat was for making Curly feel like trash for leaving us
5/2/24, 12:25 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2BoOUFSIaz/?igsh=MXAzY3BnbGlraHE3NA==

5/2/24, 12:26 am - Gerrard: Too much if anything
5/2/24, 12:26 am - James: For me atm you mean
5/2/24, 12:27 am - Gerrard: It was funny last time @61452662705 you asked how I was obviously meaning Klopp's retirement then we went into a big chat about real life issues
5/2/24, 12:28 am - James: Feel like an agony aunt atm
5/2/24, 12:39 am - Gerrard: Ok I'm sorry I picked you to be Curly, who would you feel better about being?
5/2/24, 12:39 am - Dave: This is the height of our season. May as well enjoy it. Liverpool winning the title, already in the bag ❤️
5/2/24, 12:40 am - Dave: Klopp 🐐 and Liverpool the best ❤️
5/2/24, 12:40 am - James: Saying aretzy tactically outclassed the kloppinator
5/2/24, 12:40 am - James: What I'm reading right now
5/2/24, 12:41 am - Gerrard: Madness eh
5/2/24, 12:41 am - Dave: Never. Just an off day for Klipp. 

Klopp is best manager of all time and Liverpool winning the league by ten points, MARK MY WORDS
5/2/24, 12:41 am - James: SLOBBY PLAYER OF THE YEAR! BOOKMARK THIS TWEET
5/2/24, 12:41 am - Dave: All 11 of Liverpools world beaters had an off day. Not a single one of those shite gunners are making OUR SQUAD
5/2/24, 12:41 am - Gerrard: Players had their first bad one, can't fault them for all they've given us this season. <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 12:42 am - Gerrard: I'd take the records over the season over one good game.
5/2/24, 12:42 am - Gerrard: Personally
5/2/24, 12:43 am - Dave: 🪇🪇🪇
5/2/24, 12:43 am - James: Sloppy wank gotta have a big final few months to win that award
5/2/24, 12:43 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 he's gone quickly for the rattle emojis
5/2/24, 12:43 am - Dave: These fans https://x.com/lfcvik2/status/1754218968209035566?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
5/2/24, 12:43 am - James: Funny how so many players look decent in Germany then come to a real league and struggle
5/2/24, 12:44 am - Gerrard: Bit harsh on Slobby
5/2/24, 12:44 am - Gerrard: Nothing wrong with facts
5/2/24, 12:44 am - James: Just saying what I saw
5/2/24, 12:44 am - James: How much was he?
5/2/24, 12:44 am - Gerrard: I thought he's done well
5/2/24, 12:45 am - James: £70m?
5/2/24, 12:45 am - Gerrard: I told you I'm not doing research for you, go google
5/2/24, 12:45 am - James: Yeah but your mate said pots
5/2/24, 12:45 am - Dave: When did you grow a pair of tits jezzy? https://x.com/miawilliamslfc/status/1754210544137957874?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
5/2/24, 12:45 am - Gerrard: Hey if we looked back at all our receipts I think we'd all be embarrassed
5/2/24, 12:46 am - Gerrard: About 15yrs ago
5/2/24, 12:46 am - James: Nice tits
5/2/24, 12:46 am - James: Show us them
5/2/24, 12:46 am - Gerrard: They're dropping off now, bad luck
5/2/24, 12:46 am - James: Any arsenal fans got nice tits
5/2/24, 12:46 am - James: Or just Don Robbie
5/2/24, 12:47 am - Dave: https://x.com/spacemanc/status/1754235723580912058?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
5/2/24, 12:47 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 why does Curly frequent all these pages on twitter?
5/2/24, 12:47 am - Jono: Terrible visuals right now
5/2/24, 12:47 am - Gerrard: Saggies
5/2/24, 12:48 am - James: Because he has nothing else to do
5/2/24, 12:49 am - Gerrard: Family to look after?
5/2/24, 12:50 am - Dave: Who’s curly?
5/2/24, 12:51 am - Dave: Why curly? Where’s that come from?
5/2/24, 12:51 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I think he hit his head while celebrating <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 12:52 am - Dave: You’re such an oddball
5/2/24, 12:53 am - Gerrard: Stoked that you used the correct "you're"
5/2/24, 12:54 am - James: Rodwell a raper?
5/2/24, 12:54 am - James: Who @14244893404
5/2/24, 12:55 am - Dave: Most of us don’t struggle with basic grammar in here
5/2/24, 12:55 am - James: Think that 'title challengers' needs to change
5/2/24, 12:56 am - Gerrard: Should I put Arsenal back in as challengers?
5/2/24, 12:58 am - James: Ew, what were West Spam playing at this morning
5/2/24, 12:59 am - Gerrard: What happened
5/2/24, 1:01 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/8YzaB-Jo690?si=6RuTXZ97E6B49Y2w
Rory's going through it

5/2/24, 3:50 am - James: Rent Boy
5/2/24, 4:06 am - Gerrard: Imagine we could clone him, full staff of Klopps
5/2/24, 4:08 am - ~ James changed the group name from "Title Challengers & Arsenal Fans & Newtle Symphony Orchestra 🎻 Group Chat" to "Auf Wiedersehen Klapp"
5/2/24, 4:09 am - ~ James changed this group's icon
5/2/24, 4:10 am - Gerrard: That's a shit name and photo Jimmity
5/2/24, 4:10 am - Gerrard: Do better
5/2/24, 4:10 am - James: Goodbye Klapp?
5/2/24, 4:10 am - James: What's wrong with that
5/2/24, 4:11 am - James: Not offensive
5/2/24, 4:12 am - Gerrard: Well the photo isn't football related
5/2/24, 4:12 am - Gerrard: And the name isn't encompassing all our teams
5/2/24, 4:12 am - James: Klapp related?
5/2/24, 4:12 am - Jono: Let the kid have something to be happy about
5/2/24, 4:12 am - James: Too many teams in here
5/2/24, 4:12 am - Gerrard: Also what happens if Liverpool win the quad, you're calling it too early - real Curly move
5/2/24, 4:13 am - James: He's still going?
5/2/24, 4:13 am - Jono: Sense of purpose etc
5/2/24, 4:13 am - Gerrard: At least find an angry Klopp photo
5/2/24, 4:13 am - Gerrard: Or sad Klopp photo
5/2/24, 4:13 am - James: Johnny got something to say about it 👀
5/2/24, 4:13 am - James: Had them before though
5/2/24, 4:13 am - Gerrard: I just think we can do better here
5/2/24, 4:14 am - James: There's a Twitter page obsessed with klipps bulge
5/2/24, 4:14 am - James: Shall I find that one?
5/2/24, 4:14 am - Gerrard: Get on it!
5/2/24, 4:14 am - James: Johnsy probably the admin
5/2/24, 4:14 am - Jono: Nuh the name is crap but whatever floats your boat
5/2/24, 4:15 am - Jono: Do you search Klopp on twitter? That’s wild
5/2/24, 4:15 am - James: @61409710717 can you do a welfare check on your mate. Is he going OK in the Liverpool Boys Chat group?
5/2/24, 4:15 am - Gerrard: OR a Cheap Trick band photo with Klopp's head Photoshopped onto each band members head
5/2/24, 4:16 am - James: Posting any chants today that he doesn't chant unless they're in his living room 😂
5/2/24, 4:16 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/KhWoEUJCL2Y?si=SymLvh6TC-K2Jqjp
5/2/24, 4:16 am - James: I'll have a look
5/2/24, 4:16 am - Jono: I have a pulse
5/2/24, 4:21 am - Gerrard: Banger
5/2/24, 4:30 am - Dave: Bye bye crackhead
5/2/24, 4:32 am - Gerrard: Curly has lost the plot
5/2/24, 4:35 am - Dave: What quad?? The Liverpool “quad”? 

A double is FA cup and title. A treble is FA cup, title and UCL. You’re not winning either of these so get back in your box, game over. One hit wonder during a pandemic, 1b spent, flopp
5/2/24, 4:38 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 @61452662705 just seen the goals, I don't know how the overall play was but VVD with a late Christmas present, Saliba/Gabriel shocking on the Livo goal, soft second yellow and Allison brain fart on the last goal.
Finally a rough day at the office for Livo, gave that game away.
5/2/24, 4:38 am - Gerrard: What did he say, I don't read his messages
5/2/24, 4:38 am - Dave: All I see is dribble. Genuinely didn’t read the excuses.
5/2/24, 4:38 am - Dave: Pathetic
5/2/24, 4:39 am - Dave: Congratulate us on pounding you.
5/2/24, 4:39 am - Dave: Be graceful
5/2/24, 4:39 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 what's your guess for when Arsenal title challenge is back off again? <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 4:39 am - Dave: Have some dignity like your mate
5/2/24, 4:40 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 it's the lesser team thing, need to be switched on for the small games too
5/2/24, 4:41 am - Dave: Jono isn’t on the pipe, don’t drag him into this
5/2/24, 4:41 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 @61452662705 can't believe Arteta celebrating that 3rd goal like that
5/2/24, 4:41 am - Gerrard: Especially with it being such a shit shot
5/2/24, 4:41 am - Gerrard: Up a man and already 2-1
5/2/24, 4:42 am - Gerrard: I'm so happy he's not managing the team I support
5/2/24, 4:42 am - Gerrard: Overall for Arsenal it's that old NFL saying, act like you've been there before
5/2/24, 4:42 am - Gerrard: Zero class
5/2/24, 4:46 am - Dave: Jamie carragher got more class than you laddy
5/2/24, 4:46 am - Gerrard: Lol is this what it's come to?
Are we pointing out what our explayers have won or not won?
5/2/24, 4:47 am - Gerrard: I wonder how many times Arteta has won the league in his head in Feb
5/2/24, 4:55 am - Dave: Wow
5/2/24, 5:00 am - Liam: Brave performance, well done the boys 🫶🏻

@61452662705 these guys are gonna win so many trophies in February
5/2/24, 5:14 am - Gerrard: Lol still laughing about this one, don't know why you guys think this one is a bad thing
5/2/24, 5:14 am - Gerrard: I wish I was brave enough to spit at children

5/2/24, 5:23 am - James: Yeah
5/2/24, 5:23 am - Liam: Ref was shit
5/2/24, 5:24 am - Dave: Havertz was denied a pen and we missed two sitters. 6-1 would have been a fair result
5/2/24, 5:24 am - Liam: Arsenal should of had a pen
5/2/24, 5:24 am - James: Ref beat them not you
5/2/24, 5:24 am - Dave: Liverpool were fucking trashed today
5/2/24, 5:24 am - Dave: I’m actually shocked they’re top of the table
5/2/24, 5:24 am - Liam: Ya
5/2/24, 5:24 am - Gerrard: I reckon one team's best game in years vs one team's worst game in years, fair play to Arsenal - only think they overreact like their fans.
5/2/24, 5:24 am - Liam: All 3 games we played Liverpool we should of won
5/2/24, 5:25 am - Dave: Worst game in years? Or did you take the entire season off last year?
5/2/24, 5:25 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 wow you got quite a reaction but mentioning the ref
5/2/24, 5:25 am - Dave: We’ve won 2 and drawn 2 in the last 4 league games* against you. You’re doneski <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 5:25 am - Gerrard: Wow lots of reactions in here now @61452662705
5/2/24, 5:26 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I thought they'd be happy with their own team winning, lots of talk about Liverpool and Kloppy
5/2/24, 5:26 am - Gerrard: ......almost like Liverpool is living inside their heads......

5/2/24, 5:32 am - James: Wow
5/2/24, 5:33 am - Gerrard: Arsenal has done the double this year already, the Christmas Cup and the We Beat Klopp Cup
5/2/24, 5:36 am - Dave: @61452662705 remember when Liverpool done the double against  Newty and it was the best thing since sliced bread <This message was edited>

5/2/24, 5:56 am - James: It was all the ref
5/2/24, 5:57 am - Liam: Pathetic
5/2/24, 5:57 am - James: @61404060785 stayed up, or got up at silly o'clock to watch. What does he think?
5/2/24, 5:57 am - James: Has he slept off the sadness yet
5/2/24, 5:57 am - Gerrard: No rest for the wicked
5/2/24, 5:57 am - Jono: You could honestly say this same line about every football team and a minority who use  Twitter
5/2/24, 5:57 am - Jono: I guarantee it
5/2/24, 5:58 am - James: Aww still a little grouchy then
5/2/24, 5:58 am - Gerrard: Reality
5/2/24, 5:58 am - Jono: Arsenal deserved to win
5/2/24, 5:58 am - James: Sleep it off
5/2/24, 5:58 am - Gerrard: Whoa whoa whoa
5/2/24, 5:58 am - James: I didn't see any of the game
5/2/24, 5:58 am - Jono: Said it in the Liverpool chat too
5/2/24, 5:58 am - Gerrard: Did you?
5/2/24, 5:58 am - James: Trouble in paradise?
5/2/24, 5:58 am - Jono: I said we were never in it yet still took a calamity to fuck us
5/2/24, 5:59 am - Gerrard: I refuse to watch Arteta run around the pitch after each goal
5/2/24, 5:59 am - Jono: So i took that as a positive
5/2/24, 5:59 am - James: I saw the fist pumps
5/2/24, 5:59 am - Jono: I only thought we were potentially in it when we had 2 decent chances after HT
5/2/24, 5:59 am - Gerrard: VVD out Saliba/Gabriel'd Saliba and Gabriel
5/2/24, 5:59 am - James: Not all positive things are good things
5/2/24, 5:59 am - Gerrard: Like an AIDs test
5/2/24, 6:00 am - James: HIV
5/2/24, 6:00 am - James: More dick van dyke today tbf
5/2/24, 6:01 am - James: So was it the ref?
5/2/24, 6:01 am - Gerrard: Great performer
5/2/24, 6:01 am - Gerrard: Not fair to him
5/2/24, 6:01 am - Jono: Time will tell if its the loss we needed. I'd have probably thought it was the case if we played better and deserved the points, but we didn't so yeah lets see now if they turn it around
5/2/24, 6:01 am - James: Was the ref why
5/2/24, 6:01 am - James: Should PMGOL issue a statement
5/2/24, 6:01 am - James: Whatever they're called
5/2/24, 6:02 am - James: Don't have experience of writing to them
5/2/24, 6:02 am - James: @61409710717 are the three minute highlights worth a watch
5/2/24, 6:02 am - James: I might have a look now
5/2/24, 6:02 am - James: @14244893404 the ref?
5/2/24, 6:03 am - James: Can someone clarify
5/2/24, 6:03 am - Gerrard: For calamity yeah
5/2/24, 6:04 am - Gerrard: I saw fuckups but no ref stuff
5/2/24, 6:04 am - Jono: You laugh but that Belgium BS has now opened a can of worms (Communication error like LFC/Spurs)... There's talk of bringing 1 review a half per team and just having automated offside / goal line tech only from next season.
5/2/24, 6:06 am - Gerrard: Like hockey
5/2/24, 6:07 am - James: So ref then

5/2/24, 6:35 am - Dave: I think konate was a soft red (second yellow). But it was in the 88th minute so made no difference to the outcome of the game. 

Arsenal were also denied a pen that Mac gave away against Havertz. 

Liverpool hate Taylor so it was always going to be contentious. Ref had zero to do with the game today. It’s the first game we’ve played in two years against Liverpool that I wasn’t stressed the entire time. Totally deserved that win
5/2/24, 6:37 am - Dave: Only part of the game Liverpool looked dangerous was the 10-15 mins into the second half. Arsenal looked shell shocked from their own goal at the end of the first. Other than that, all Arsenal.
5/2/24, 6:39 am - Dave: Liverpool will bounce back. They’ll destroy Burnley next week and this will be all forgotten about lol

5/2/24, 7:10 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I'd still back Newtle finishing higher than the Arse
5/2/24, 7:10 am - James: Unless they drop below 6th zero chance unfortunately
5/2/24, 7:10 am - James: Are they still in FA Cup?
5/2/24, 7:11 am - James: Or did they get knocked out already
5/2/24, 7:11 am - Dave: But what?
5/2/24, 7:12 am - Dave: This doesn’t work while you’ve got your pants round your ankles. New box boy
5/2/24, 7:13 am - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣 ripping bits off just like Arteta rips off Peps tactics
5/2/24, 7:13 am - Gerrard: It seems like we're back to not looking at the table
5/2/24, 7:14 am - Gerrard: Just crossed paths with an Arsenal supporter, could cut the tension
5/2/24, 7:18 am - Jono: We knocked them out
5/2/24, 7:27 am - James: Optus Sport panel of the game said you don't look till March
5/2/24, 7:27 am - Gerrard: But hey, he didn't handball it into his own net 🫣
5/2/24, 7:27 am - Gerrard: Ok fine

5/2/24, 10:27 am - Jono: Mark that down
5/2/24, 10:27 am - Liam: 4-4 with luton wouldn’t of helped
5/2/24, 10:27 am - James: 4th and 5th if CL is 5th will flip flop

5/2/24, 10:28 am - Jono: I said all along City is gonna win it
5/2/24, 10:28 am - Jono: We’d just keep it interesting
5/2/24, 10:28 am - James: Yeeeee
5/2/24, 10:28 am - Jono: And maybe Arse
5/2/24, 10:28 am - James: But that's a kop out mate
5/2/24, 10:28 am - James: Not buying it
5/2/24, 10:28 am - James: You all say that
5/2/24, 10:29 am - Liam: If Chelsea win a cup they take one of the spots right?
5/2/24, 10:29 am - Jono: Before the start of the season I was happy with 4th haha honestly
5/2/24, 10:29 am - James: Possibly I don't know
5/2/24, 10:29 am - James: No way they will
5/2/24, 10:29 am - Jono: And with good reason
5/2/24, 10:29 am - Jono: They’ve won the cunt 5 from 6 seasons
5/2/24, 10:30 am - Liam: Ya think they take the shit European space
5/2/24, 10:30 am - James: Yes, Chelsea would take conference
5/2/24, 10:30 am - Liam: Fa cup takes Europa
5/2/24, 10:30 am - James: But if Varpool win and get CL, it goes to 7th
5/2/24, 10:30 am - Liam: So potentially only top 5 gets you a spot
5/2/24, 10:30 am - James: And if FA Cup winner is also a CL team, it goes to 6th
5/2/24, 10:31 am - James: Yeah but I don't know how that's changed this season because top 5 gives you CL potentially
5/2/24, 10:32 am - James: Which means 6th will be europa
5/2/24, 10:32 am - James: And FA Cup winner europa
5/2/24, 10:32 am - Liam: Interesting to see if a club like Chelsea, united and newy can buy in the summer if they don’t get Europe
5/2/24, 10:32 am - James: Fuck knows
5/2/24, 10:32 am - Liam: Or if they even have to sell
5/2/24, 10:32 am - James: Everyone has to sell
5/2/24, 10:32 am - James: You have to sell
5/2/24, 10:33 am - James: Why do you think nobody signed anyone
5/2/24, 10:33 am - James: It was the end of the rolling three year ffp shite
5/2/24, 10:34 am - James: Which is changing in the summer
5/2/24, 10:35 am - James: Technically spurs should have tonnes of money but I guess a lot of Kane's fee is going into stadium costs
5/2/24, 10:35 am - James: Same as West Ham
5/2/24, 10:35 am - Liam: How can it be rolling and end in the summer?
5/2/24, 10:36 am - James: I think it's done on a three year cycle
5/2/24, 10:36 am - James: I'm not sure
5/2/24, 10:36 am - James: If it's three years but always rolling
5/2/24, 10:36 am - James: Or just three year blocks
5/2/24, 10:37 am - James: Deffo £105m of losses allowed over three years
5/2/24, 10:37 am - James: Which has been the same since 2010
5/2/24, 10:37 am - Liam: Do you often make statements, without knowing the fact?
5/2/24, 10:37 am - James: Which makes no sense how inflation has gone up
5/2/24, 10:37 am - James: Do you often ask questions you could look up yourself
5/2/24, 10:38 am - Liam: Frequently
5/2/24, 10:38 am - James: Or is there no pop up book available on the matter which a retard like you could understand?
5/2/24, 10:38 am - Liam: No pop up book is available on the market
5/2/24, 10:38 am - James: Liam that's FFP 👆
5/2/24, 10:39 am - James: It's coming for you
5/2/24, 10:39 am - Liam: 😂
5/2/24, 10:39 am - James: 😂
5/2/24, 10:39 am - Liam: Makes sense now, thanks.
5/2/24, 10:40 am - Liam: Right, I feel like I have contributed enough. See you guys in 3/4 months.
5/2/24, 10:46 am - Jono: I’ll always remember @61478754484 now for two things. His unwavering pleasure on this fateful day plus singing YNWA with me at Cheers <This message was edited>

5/2/24, 10:50 pm - James: True
5/2/24, 10:54 pm - James: Thinking Varsenal more likely to be battling for 3rd to 5th @61409710717
5/2/24, 10:54 pm - James: Spurs have a clear run
5/2/24, 10:54 pm - James: Villa already beat them

5/2/24, 10:56 pm - James: Miracle like Leicester 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
5/2/24, 10:57 pm - Gerrard: I know he'll see this and react but I'll say it anyway, Arsenal celebrating like that while still being 2pts back is embarrassing
5/2/24, 10:57 pm - Jono: Where do you find this shit? Haha
5/2/24, 10:57 pm - Jono: The obsession is clear

5/2/24, 10:58 pm - James: Like johnsy and Newcastle tbf
5/2/24, 10:58 pm - Dave: This was actually shared from a lad I went to school with and appeared on my timeline. Choked on my porridge laughing

5/2/24, 11:12 pm - Gerrard: It's official
5/2/24, 11:13 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 I do like that everyone in the football world thought Arsenal were gonna get spanked but afterwards it's all Liverpool fans being overconfident.
Did you see Don Robbie going off? <This message was edited>

5/2/24, 11:51 pm - James: Who's your mate
6/2/24, 1:23 am - Dave: We’re doomed
6/2/24, 1:29 am - James: What's the point of him staying on for another failure in the summer
6/2/24, 1:29 am - James: Everyone knows the team he will pick
6/2/24, 1:30 am - Dave: Not sure why, so strange. We all know we’re winning fuck all with him. Have done for years
6/2/24, 1:31 am - Jono: Jurgen next? lol
6/2/24, 1:31 am - Dave: Klopp and mourinho freeing up as well. Go all out and try and land one of them
6/2/24, 1:31 am - Jono: That would be hilarious
6/2/24, 1:31 am - Dave: Honestly. Give him a blank cheque
6/2/24, 1:31 am - Dave: Southgate won’t get a job in the championship after this
6/2/24, 3:04 am - James: Think the fans want him out as well now
6/2/24, 3:04 am - James: Their squad is horrendous
6/2/24, 3:09 am - James: Statement incoming?
6/2/24, 3:09 am - Gerrard: I think maybe Newty will be the photographers that day
6/2/24, 3:37 am - James: No excuses for them at Emirates. Should be winning
6/2/24, 3:37 am - James: No big Joe to blame either
6/2/24, 3:37 am - James: What time is that. Weird one
6/2/24, 3:37 am - James: Late Saturday night
6/2/24, 3:38 am - James: Nice for the fans to travel home
6/2/24, 3:38 am - Gerrard: That's a group viewable time
6/2/24, 3:38 am - James: Remember the meltdown they had last season because they couldn't win
6/2/24, 3:38 am - Gerrard: I only know one Arsenal fan who is brave enough to watch with opposition fans
6/2/24, 3:39 am - James: Pero?
6/2/24, 3:39 am - Gerrard: Yep, Moe himself
6/2/24, 3:39 am - James: Us three can watch then
6/2/24, 3:39 am - James: Birthday watch
6/2/24, 3:40 am - Gerrard: Oh I don't care to watch it....
6/2/24, 3:42 am - James: You do you bro
6/2/24, 3:43 am - Gerrard: Lol
6/2/24, 3:43 am - Gerrard: See how I feel then
6/2/24, 3:43 am - James: No need I won't watch
6/2/24, 3:43 am - James: I'm out that weekend
6/2/24, 3:43 am - James: And we will lose

6/2/24, 4:20 am - James: Varpool beat us, we beat you, you beat them

For @61409710717
6/2/24, 4:35 am - Gerrard: In his fingers?
6/2/24, 4:45 am - Dave: Konate was his bitch. Skinned on every break ❤️
6/2/24, 4:47 am - Gerrard: Did he score without VVD gifting him one?
I'm just asking for real tangible stats, not just 'he looked good'
6/2/24, 4:47 am - Gerrard: Need to move away from opinions and just stick to facts
6/2/24, 5:08 am - James: Shocking
6/2/24, 5:13 am - Jono: Probs karma for getting his ex wife killed
6/2/24, 6:21 am - Dave: The new king certainly had the last laugh 👊 💪
6/2/24, 6:49 am - Gerrard: How many games?
6/2/24, 6:49 am - Gerrard: Jesus Christ
6/2/24, 7:32 am - Dave: “since the start of last season” so 4 games. Martinelli is statistically the player your team should fear most. 

Like Bobby against us, glad Klopp dropped him 😮‍💨
6/2/24, 9:20 am - James: Who's rattled about what now
6/2/24, 9:21 am - Gerrard: Why not look at all his games against Livo?
6/2/24, 9:22 am - Gerrard: Can't tell but I know your mate is choosing sections of history to suit his arguments
6/2/24, 9:22 am - James: https://youtube.com/shorts/jzbV1MsgB9c?si=SVLDSm21YpE72gni
6/2/24, 4:50 pm - Dave: Sure
6/2/24, 4:53 pm - Dave: No player in the premier league has more goal contributions against Liverpool than martinelli. Not sure why you’re rattled here
6/2/24, 8:44 pm - Gerrard: I don't think it's enough to be talking about like he's ripping up the right
6/2/24, 9:10 pm - Gerrard: Why are you so upset about this?
6/2/24, 9:45 pm - James: Who's rattling still

7/2/24, 12:14 am - Gerrard: From historical data
7/2/24, 12:40 am - Dave: Great watch, thanks for sharing. Elite manager. New king in town
7/2/24, 1:32 am - Pero: Agreed great watch
7/2/24, 2:08 am - Gerrard: (2nd)
7/2/24, 2:09 am - Gerrard: I know for a fact you don't watch YouTube clips
7/2/24, 2:12 am - Gerrard: SORRY 🤣🤣🤣 (3rd)
7/2/24, 2:13 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 @61404060785 Arsenal beat Liverpool and dropped a place on the ladder.
7/2/24, 2:27 am - Gerrard: facts
7/2/24, 2:33 am - Pero: This particular one I watched to the end. Fantastic analysis 👏
7/2/24, 2:34 am - Gerrard: I'll dig up some other ones for you to watch.
7/2/24, 2:37 am - Pero: More arteta master class videos ? That one was a pretty good summary
7/2/24, 2:38 am - Gerrard: Not a lot of those videos going around in recent years.
7/2/24, 2:40 am - Pero: They not showing up in your algorithm
7/2/24, 2:41 am - Gerrard: I was just thinking these guys who make the videos really know how to get the likes from the Arsenal fans.
7/2/24, 2:42 am - Dave: Klopps managed 1 win against Arteta in the past 5 matches. 

Hate to break it to you, but Arteta is on the way up and Klopp is “running out of energy” 😣😢
7/2/24, 2:42 am - Gerrard: I wonder what you would have said 2 weeks ago.
7/2/24, 2:44 am - Gerrard: solid comeback
7/2/24, 2:44 am - Dave: Poor old klapp 😴
7/2/24, 2:46 am - Dave: Let the results and the facts do the talking ✅
7/2/24, 2:56 am - Gerrard: Facts like us having to look after our emotional Arsenal fan friends.
Every year overreacting losses like it's the end of the world, overreacting to wins like they're the best team in the world.
7/2/24, 2:57 am - Gerrard: Then come each season's end we all find out they're just not good enough.
7/2/24, 2:58 am - Gerrard: I personally can't keep being the shoulder to cry on for you guys every year.
7/2/24, 2:58 am - Gerrard: I'm sorry but enough is enough, sort yourselves out.
7/2/24, 2:59 am - Liam: 🪇
7/2/24, 3:01 am - Gerrard: Exactly....
7/2/24, 3:02 am - Gerrard: This relationship is toxic
7/2/24, 3:06 am - Dave: 🪇
7/2/24, 3:07 am - Gerrard: Mmmmmm
7/2/24, 3:12 am - Gerrard: I hope you guys don't have as bad a comedown as I had in December
7/2/24, 3:18 am - Jono: 2 wins to 1 and you're making it sound like Arteta has Klopp bent over
7/2/24, 3:18 am - Jono: Ok buddy
7/2/24, 3:18 am - Gerrard: It's hard to understand the sample sizes, almost irresponsible
7/2/24, 3:26 am - Liam: I think klopps leaving at the right time. He is clearly on the decline.
7/2/24, 3:29 am - James: Rattle FC up in ere
7/2/24, 3:29 am - Jono: Lost 2 in 22 (i think about 30 actually counting end of last season)
7/2/24, 3:30 am - Jono: Definition: Decline
7/2/24, 4:41 am - Gerrard: Arteta is only gonna hurt you guys, you should leave him

7/2/24, 5:17 am - Dave: Broke the system
7/2/24, 5:17 am - Dave: New king in town
7/2/24, 5:22 am - Gerrard: Repeat posts again, the Arteta madness is creeping in
7/2/24, 5:26 am - Dave: Reason you’re rattled is because Arsenal dicked you this weekend. Wasn’t even close. And you know you’re bottle jobs if you don’t win the league, is yours to lose 🫠😢
7/2/24, 6:55 am - James: Insane reactions in ere. It's Wednesday already

7/2/24, 7:38 am - Jono: 🙏
7/2/24, 7:38 am - Gerrard: I thought Chelsea beat Arsenal in the Europa league final
7/2/24, 7:38 am - Gerrard: Didn't they?
7/2/24, 7:38 am - Jono: Yeah the year before
7/2/24, 7:39 am - Jono: Forgot about that
7/2/24, 7:39 am - Gerrard: Did West Ham win a European trophy before Arsenal have?
7/2/24, 7:39 am - Jono: Was thinking domestically
7/2/24, 7:39 am - Gerrard: Ah k
7/2/24, 7:39 am - Dave: Not sure how you’re giving Emery credit for that FA cup when he didn’t manage a single game in the tournament but hey
7/2/24, 7:39 am - Jono: They won a Cup Winners Cup in 1994
7/2/24, 7:40 am - Jono: And an Intertoto Cup
7/2/24, 7:40 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 why is he complaining? He made the rules
7/2/24, 7:40 am - Dave: Coveted
7/2/24, 7:41 am - Jono: Man… for a big club you’d expect a bit more Euro success. Just sayin… I honestly thought they’d won more.
7/2/24, 7:41 am - Jono: At least a UEFA cup
7/2/24, 7:41 am - Jono: Cup Winners is Conference equivalent I think
7/2/24, 7:41 am - Dave: Well he joined halfway through the season taking Arsenal over when (I think) they were 12th. Hardly fair criticising him on finishing 8th that year when he only managed 50% of the games. 

FA cup arteta managed for the entirety of the tournament and won it, therefore that’s his. Not rocket science
7/2/24, 7:42 am - Dave: Always been shite in Europe, hopefully arteta can change that
7/2/24, 7:42 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 going pretty hard for someone who's supposedly not wrong eh <This message was edited>
7/2/24, 7:43 am - Dave: You’re entitled to an opinion. I’ve got mine 🤷‍♂️
7/2/24, 7:43 am - Gerrard: Kinda sounds a bit.....
7/2/24, 7:43 am - Gerrard: You know....
7/2/24, 7:43 am - Jono: Covid saved him though. Levelled the playing field. At least with the league we had already sewn it up.

I’m just fishing now haha
7/2/24, 7:43 am - Dave: Only one rattled in here is you laddy
7/2/24, 7:44 am - Gerrard: I'm rattled?
7/2/24, 7:44 am - Liam: Yes
7/2/24, 7:45 am - Dave: Oh god yeah. Always know when we’ve caught you because the random screenshots and YouTube videos start getting quickfired into the group
7/2/24, 7:45 am - Gerrard: Rattled, me?
7/2/24, 7:45 am - Gerrard: I'm what?
7/2/24, 7:46 am - Dave: Happy to forfeit that FA cup if you forfeit the league 😂
7/2/24, 7:47 am - Gerrard: Vs
7/2/24, 7:49 am - Jono: Reminds me of this season
7/2/24, 7:49 am - Jono: Both fighting to the death while city pour acid over us both
7/2/24, 7:50 am - Gerrard: Undercover Arteta?
7/2/24, 7:50 am - Dave: Scrapping hard over second
7/2/24, 7:52 am - Dave: Heard an insane stat earlier. Foden already has as many hat-tricks as bale, mane, hazard and gerrard in prem
7/2/24, 7:52 am - Gerrard: Cuck Curly
7/2/24, 7:52 am - Dave: Got a lol out of me there 👏
7/2/24, 7:53 am - Gerrard: Pure cuck reply
7/2/24, 7:54 am - Liam: Rattled
7/2/24, 7:54 am - Gerrard: ???
7/2/24, 7:55 am - Gerrard: Why?
7/2/24, 7:55 am - Liam: Mikel slapped your boy about
7/2/24, 7:55 am - Liam: Live in tv
7/2/24, 7:56 am - Liam: Millions watching
7/2/24, 7:56 am - Gerrard: ???
7/2/24, 7:56 am - Dave: Proper dicking on their last meet
7/2/24, 7:56 am - Liam: It’s Embarrassing we understand
7/2/24, 7:56 am - Dave: What a way to bow out
7/2/24, 7:56 am - Gerrard: What are you talking about?
7/2/24, 7:56 am - Gerrard: Why though?
7/2/24, 7:56 am - Gerrard: Who?
7/2/24, 7:56 am - Dave: Klapp looked like he was going to cry @61478754484
7/2/24, 7:57 am - Gerrard: Who's Klapp?
7/2/24, 7:57 am - Liam: Embarrassing 😬
7/2/24, 7:57 am - Gerrard: What part?
7/2/24, 7:57 am - Gerrard: If anything Arsenal embarrassed themselves
7/2/24, 7:59 am - Gerrard: Klopp was the real winner after that game
7/2/24, 8:02 am - Gerrard: I think Liverpool fans took the moral victory over the Arsenal fans today
7/2/24, 8:50 am - Dave: https://x.com/hayterstv/status/1754874570291532278?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA

7/2/24, 9:27 am - James: Lotta content in here today 👌
7/2/24, 9:27 am - James: Getting more as the week goes on

7/2/24, 10:53 pm - Dave: Shithouse isn’t it 😂😂 proper Maupay move, love it
7/2/24, 10:53 pm - James: Does he usually fist pamp?
7/2/24, 10:54 pm - Jono: Imitation is the greatest form of flattery
7/2/24, 10:56 pm - Liam: Never
7/2/24, 10:57 pm - James: Fuck real mug off
7/2/24, 10:57 pm - James: More of an uppercut than pump though
7/2/24, 10:58 pm - James: Needs some work
7/2/24, 10:58 pm - Dave: First time ever. Saved it for a special occasion
7/2/24, 10:59 pm - James: Been doing it all season with the screaming at officials and whining post match tbf
7/2/24, 11:00 pm - James: Artetsy will be the only insufferable cunt manager left at the end of the season
7/2/24, 11:02 pm - Dave: You turning a blind eye to some other solid candidates
7/2/24, 11:03 pm - Dave: Would argue poch is up there, blokes a nightmare
7/2/24, 11:03 pm - James: Yeah and he's shite
7/2/24, 11:03 pm - James: Never understood fascination with him
7/2/24, 11:03 pm - Dave: You see him after city game?
7/2/24, 11:03 pm - Liam: But he’s getting sacked
7/2/24, 11:03 pm - James: Yep
7/2/24, 11:03 pm - Dave: Ran on the pitch
7/2/24, 11:03 pm - Dave: Wanted to punch ref lol
7/2/24, 11:04 pm - James: He ever won anything?
7/2/24, 11:04 pm - Liam: Pretty sure he didn’t even win the league with psg
7/2/24, 11:04 pm - James: Robbed in a CL final
7/2/24, 11:06 pm - James: Jez entering the group chat...
7/2/24, 11:06 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 @61404060785  I think it shows Klopp is in Arteta's head that he's trying to make fun of his fist pumps.
Watching a lot of Liverpool games in his spare time.
7/2/24, 11:09 pm - Gerrard: Yesterday I scored;
"Rattled" = 5
"🪇" = 11
7/2/24, 11:10 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 can I count the one above too?
7/2/24, 11:10 pm - Gerrard: Sorry, the three above too?
7/2/24, 11:11 pm - Dave: Heard Xabi rejected Liverpool @61452662705 @61478754484 ?
7/2/24, 11:13 pm - James: ?
7/2/24, 11:13 pm - Gerrard: ?

7/2/24, 11:14 pm - James: Citations
7/2/24, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: What 24hrs period am I allowed to use? <This message was edited>
7/2/24, 11:35 pm - James: Who will it be then?
7/2/24, 11:35 pm - James: FSG won't spend to get a manger out of contract I doubt
7/2/24, 11:35 pm - James: Potter?
7/2/24, 11:38 pm - James: All I know is it'll never be the same again
7/2/24, 11:44 pm - Pero: Big Sam
7/2/24, 11:44 pm - Jono: Shattered Aberdeen beat us to Warnock

7/2/24, 11:49 pm - James: Jamie Carragher
7/2/24, 11:49 pm - Gerrard: Good shout, will spit at them to train harder
7/2/24, 11:51 pm - James: FSG are an odd lot so if they do get someone out of contract maybe they'll go nazi again and go for the young bloke at Dortmund
8/2/24, 12:02 am - Dave: Seen a few Thomas Frank rumours on Twitter in last 24 hours
8/2/24, 12:03 am - Dave: Liverpool can hire Southgate

8/2/24, 1:00 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 didn't Cunty McCuntface manager Newtle?
8/2/24, 1:04 am - James: Cabbage McBacon
8/2/24, 1:06 am - James: He's available. Great manager
8/2/24, 1:06 am - James: Lots of prem titles. Varpool could do with that experience
8/2/24, 1:19 am - Gerrard: Yours too buddy
8/2/24, 1:19 am - James: You comparing Varpool to Newcastle now. Noice
8/2/24, 1:20 am - James: You're supposed to be winning titles with all that finance since the 70s etc
8/2/24, 1:20 am - James: Not 1 per 50 years <This message was edited>
8/2/24, 1:20 am - Gerrard: Well you claim Livo only has 1, Newtle has 0 so it's close then
8/2/24, 1:20 am - James: Fair
8/2/24, 1:20 am - Gerrard: Well that's a bit off
8/2/24, 1:20 am - James: When was the last one?
8/2/24, 1:21 am - James: Before covid?
8/2/24, 1:21 am - Gerrard: 1990
8/2/24, 1:21 am - Gerrard: When was Newty's last?

8/2/24, 1:25 am - James: I don't celebrate
8/2/24, 1:25 am - Gerrard: C'mon
8/2/24, 1:25 am - Gerrard: Remember, positive vibes only
8/2/24, 1:25 am - James: I don't commiserate
8/2/24, 1:27 am - Gerrard: I prefer 14 in 50yrs

8/2/24, 1:33 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 teach Larry to get photos without watermarks
8/2/24, 2:00 am - Dave: Perfect fit for Liverpool
8/2/24, 2:04 am - Dave: 🤔🤨 https://x.com/lfcaj_2/status/1755175933424611423?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
8/2/24, 2:10 am - Dave: “Surprisingly easy” 🏆🏆🏆🏆 https://x.com/anythinglfc_/status/1755320399137546614?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
8/2/24, 3:07 am - James: Easy because he is a thick cunt
8/2/24, 3:07 am - James: Don't think I've ever heard him speak
8/2/24, 3:07 am - James: Don't want to again
8/2/24, 3:07 am - Gerrard: Wow
8/2/24, 3:08 am - James: What does Nuni sound like?
8/2/24, 3:08 am - James: Bet he has a really high pitched girly voice
8/2/24, 3:08 am - James: Mexican accent obvs
8/2/24, 3:09 am - James: I don't get this
8/2/24, 3:52 am - Dave: Neither did I. Xabi said hello and shook a hand and Liverpool fans started creaming themselves 🤷‍♂️
8/2/24, 3:55 am - Dave: Quadruple innit. Remember what happened last time they talked about winning the quadruple 👀
8/2/24, 3:56 am - Gerrard: The jealousy is palpable
8/2/24, 4:00 am - James: Rodwell wants the other ticket @61404060785
8/2/24, 4:01 am - James: Or that's who he thinks is your next manager
8/2/24, 4:02 am - James: Thomas Frank vibes
8/2/24, 4:02 am - Jono: For a minute i thought that was a legit request
8/2/24, 4:02 am - Dave: Darkness super fan
8/2/24, 4:03 am - Jono: @14244893404 's not in town i assume? I'm terrible at keeping up with movements on this chat
8/2/24, 4:04 am - Dave: Wrong continent otherwise I’d already be going. They’re class live, Justin Hawkins is an animal
8/2/24, 4:04 am - Jono: Gez has a date apparently
8/2/24, 4:04 am - Jono: And is ditching me
8/2/24, 4:04 am - Jono: So i've offered to Jimmity
8/2/24, 4:04 am - Dave: Were my first ever gig in 2003 and got a pint of piss to the face 🥰
8/2/24, 4:05 am - Jono: I believe @61402741193 is going too
8/2/24, 4:05 am - Dave: And took the above pic at enmore a few years back
8/2/24, 4:08 am - James: Jez can meet us after once it goes tits up

8/2/24, 4:09 am - Chris: Great photo
8/2/24, 4:10 am - Jono: You went finger in hey?
8/2/24, 4:10 am - Jono: Chileans love that apparently lol
8/2/24, 4:15 am - Chris: I'm not really chilean.
8/2/24, 5:20 am - Gerrard: Like clockwork.
Tam's brought in a new batch of clung for me to take a run at, this BumbleBFF is amazing.

8/2/24, 10:07 pm - Jono: Thiago
8/2/24, 10:07 pm - Jono: Injured again lol

8/2/24, 10:25 pm - James: Get lost
8/2/24, 10:34 pm - Dave: April 1st today?
8/2/24, 10:37 pm - James: Owen was right. It's all just athletes now who can run and pass the ball five yards
8/2/24, 10:38 pm - James: Joke btw
8/2/24, 10:38 pm - Dave: You see how long I was typing for?
8/2/24, 10:39 pm - James: I reckon a midtable prem team now would murder a top team from ten years ago and more
8/2/24, 10:39 pm - Dave: Got me 🎣
8/2/24, 10:40 pm - James: One of his arguments was wingers not beating their man as much. Probably because the full backs are much better maybe? <This message was edited>
8/2/24, 10:41 pm - Dave: Totally agree. That’s why I was pissing myself at those YouTube jokers vid that was posted in here yesterday about top 5 managers. One of their reasoning that Klopp should be ranked above Wenger in all time greats is because “I think that 19/20 team would beat Arsenals 1998 team”
8/2/24, 10:41 pm - James: Let's compare Keown to Anderson at Palace
8/2/24, 10:41 pm - Dave: Of course they would, they’d destroy that Arsenal team. But it was also a totally different game back then
8/2/24, 10:42 pm - Gerrard: I just don't think Wenger was a very good manager that's all
8/2/24, 10:42 pm - Dave: Doesn’t take anything from wenger as a manager
8/2/24, 10:42 pm - James: I don't think Ferguson would thrive. Bloke was just a cheer leader
8/2/24, 10:42 pm - Dave: You’re like the Ty of Liverpool fans
8/2/24, 10:42 pm - James: 4-4-2 go get at em lads
8/2/24, 10:43 pm - Gerrard: Personal attacks started early today @61452662705
8/2/24, 10:44 pm - Dave: Not attacks, just facts
8/2/24, 10:48 pm - James: Current Newcastle team would maul the invisibles side @61409710717
8/2/24, 10:53 pm - Liam: Couldn’t even maul luton
8/2/24, 10:56 pm - Gerrard: Fair shout
8/2/24, 10:57 pm - Gerrard: With or without the refs doing them favours?
8/2/24, 10:58 pm - James: Mauled you though lols
8/2/24, 11:27 pm - Jono: https://x.com/bryansgunn/status/1755666016124747808?s=20
8/2/24, 11:28 pm - Jono: Hahah these vids are incredible
9/2/24, 1:17 am - Dave: 💯 Murphy would have skinned Ashley Cole alive on that right wing. No way Bergkamp would have gotten past big Dan burn and botman. Henry will have to find some extra pace if he wants to get behind Schar!!
9/2/24, 1:18 am - James: Wouldn't get the ball off us mate. Be pressed until you explode like a hammer to fucking grape <This message was edited>

Keepers pen is a thing of beauty
10/2/24, 1:02 am - Gerrard: Oofft you guys got called out, Klopp and Livo definitely in Arteta's head.
At least you've trademarked the Zoolander camera thing. <This message was edited>
10/2/24, 1:08 am - Dave: Would argue arteta is living in Liverpools head if the lads are trying to claim only they’re the only team that are allowed to celebrate and Arteta’s “stealing” the celebrations
10/2/24, 1:09 am - Dave: https://youtu.be/jJbxwjh2Tcc?si=uBVPaRQJubieqOKd
10/2/24, 1:09 am - Gerrard: Totally just say the same thing I said straight to me, you're really good at this
10/2/24, 1:10 am - Gerrard: Still living off this?
10/2/24, 1:12 am - Dave: Oh god yeah. And if we don’t win anything this season, which is highly likely, beating city and Liverpool may be the highlight of our season so you’ll be hearing about it for a long time 🤤
10/2/24, 1:17 am - Gerrard: Think we talked about knocking Arsenal out of the cup for about half a day, then moved on to the next game <This message was edited>
10/2/24, 1:21 am - Gerrard: I don't think @61452662705 talked for long after Newty beat Arsenal fairly.
It was Arsenal fans talking too much again.
10/2/24, 1:22 am - James: Only in retort over the tears about it
10/2/24, 1:25 am - Dave: Well it’s all you talked about last season.. “the double” over Newcastle
10/2/24, 1:27 am - Dave: Look, when you boys win the “quadruple” @61409710717, taking 5 points off you in the season you break history will be a huge achievement. You’ve got to give us that little bit of glory
10/2/24, 2:15 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 gone of topic in record time
10/2/24, 4:04 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2p5abfLbhX/?igsh=MW41MzJxeG9jbHZwNQ==

10/2/24, 6:45 pm - Dave: Phil, oh my days.. 😂 he sent me two videos from the gig. 

One video of Hawkins saying he hates people filming the show on their phones, and the other video is him shoving a phone in Hawkins face 😂😂😂

Good to see you @61452662705 & @61402741193 
We managed to find a bar open and worth waiting in line for in the entertainment quarter after about 30 minutes of frantic searching. Sydney for ya…
11/2/24, 12:33 am - Gerrard: I told you both that you weren't cunts in real life, ❤️
11/2/24, 12:50 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C3LN0j6Nlbg/?igsh=MWE3NGczcTB6NXpqcA==
Three for the lads
11/2/24, 12:57 am - Jono: But Hawkins called us all cunts
11/2/24, 12:58 am - Gerrard: Ouch, did you start talking about football to him?
11/2/24, 12:59 am - James: He's a Norwich fan
11/2/24, 1:01 am - Gerrard: Aaaaaah so he hates Luis Suarez then and Jono got into it with him
11/2/24, 1:05 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2ctTdeIOjq/?igsh=MW55bHZpdjhkdDJ1NQ==

11/2/24, 8:41 am - Gerrard: 💯
11/2/24, 8:41 am - Gerrard: Me and my dad did once choose to take another road there
11/2/24, 11:05 am - James: https://youtu.be/puB4i8FCw_Q?feature=shared
11/2/24, 11:05 am - James: No idea how or why this came up last night but it did 😳
11/2/24, 11:05 am - James: Espn American fake news
11/2/24, 11:07 am - Jono: This was a great mention yday at the pub
11/2/24, 11:08 am - Jono: It came up coz Phil was mentioning random Man City legends before they sold out
11/2/24, 11:09 am - Jono: Eg Danny Tiago
11/2/24, 11:09 am - Jono: Tiatto*
11/2/24, 11:10 am - James: And I went with Ben Thatcher
11/2/24, 11:11 am - James: Phil going on about citeh was the trigger
11/2/24, 11:11 am - Jono: Also random spot in that video
11/2/24, 11:12 am - Jono: Sol Campbell playing for Pompy
11/2/24, 11:12 am - Jono: Had no idea
11/2/24, 11:12 am - Jono: Glen Johnson I remember
11/2/24, 11:17 am - James: Portsmouth were better than citeh then
11/2/24, 11:17 am - James: That was when they were signing all sorts which ended up putting them in administration. They won FA Cup though <This message was edited>
11/2/24, 4:00 pm - Dave: Home section will be empty by the time the second half kicks off
11/2/24, 7:51 pm - James: What is happening with villa
11/2/24, 8:51 pm - James: Bloody hell West Ham doing their best to get Moyes out
11/2/24, 8:51 pm - James: Looked rigged from the off
11/2/24, 9:45 pm - Dave: Or Arsenal were just superb again 🤷‍♂️ Come back a new team after two weeks in Dubai
11/2/24, 9:45 pm - James: No lol
11/2/24, 9:45 pm - James: That was all west ham come on
11/2/24, 9:46 pm - James: disgraceful
11/2/24, 9:46 pm - James: Sheff Utd would have won similar
11/2/24, 9:48 pm - Dave: So it’s a coincidence Arsenal have battered everyone since coming back from their team trip to Dubai scoring 16 goals in their last 4 games?
11/2/24, 9:48 pm - James: Who you beat?
11/2/24, 9:48 pm - Dave: I mean, facts only. The boys are looking bloody good
11/2/24, 9:49 pm - James: Yes, most things in football are just coincidence
11/2/24, 9:49 pm - James: West Ham haven't won this year
11/2/24, 9:50 pm - Dave: And?
11/2/24, 9:51 pm - James: I just don't think they turned up today. It was a get this manager out performance
11/2/24, 9:51 pm - James: Anyone could have smashed them
11/2/24, 9:51 pm - James: I just don't want you getting over excited
11/2/24, 9:56 pm - Dave: Did you watch the game? They turned up until they started getting dicked, then capitulated. Arsenal are just playing really well at the moment 😍
11/2/24, 10:31 pm - Pero: What a performance from the gunners !! Fantastic ! 🫶
11/2/24, 10:36 pm - Pero: Trossard was great that guy can play anywhere so versatile
11/2/24, 11:11 pm - Gerrard: Careful, didn't Arsenal do this one time?
11/2/24, 11:13 pm - James: West Ham nonetheless?
11/2/24, 11:13 pm - James: Or Southampton?
12/2/24, 1:15 am - James: https://youtu.be/CeNvnISD2fI?feature=shared
12/2/24, 1:15 am - James: 🕯️
12/2/24, 2:22 am - Gerrard: No cameras and fist bumps this week?
12/2/24, 3:06 am - Gerrard: https://twitter.com/49ers/status/1756845969357054377
What. The. Fuck, is wrong with American sports coverage
12/2/24, 3:17 am - James: It's just ads ads ads
12/2/24, 3:17 am - James: Even at the games live
12/2/24, 3:17 am - James: They stop it to do an ad or sing a song
12/2/24, 3:18 am - James: Hence why football isn't popular. They want it played in quarters so they can pump you with ads
12/2/24, 3:18 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 this is the country you chose to be part of
12/2/24, 3:18 am - James: All their sports are shit
12/2/24, 3:19 am - James: Rodwell is just a big ad now
12/2/24, 3:19 am - James: Surprised he doesn't post one after each time he writes something in here
12/2/24, 3:19 am - Dave: Ads are the best part lol
12/2/24, 3:20 am - Dave: Love going to games live. Putting on a right show. Hate watching on tv
12/2/24, 3:20 am - James: I love how you pay for things here like optus and they still have ads
12/2/24, 3:20 am - Dave: But to be fair I don’t like anything other than football, boxing and UFC
12/2/24, 3:21 am - James: I went to a CFL game in Saskatchewan and it was shit. Just sat there wishing I was watching football instead
12/2/24, 3:22 am - James: Cheerleaders are class. That's a positive
12/2/24, 3:22 am - Dave: Where the fuck is Saskatchewan
12/2/24, 3:22 am - Dave: Probably why it was shit
12/2/24, 3:23 am - James: It is all the same
12/2/24, 3:23 am - Dave: American sports are class live
12/2/24, 3:23 am - Dave: Just wank on tv
12/2/24, 3:25 am - James: Yeah alright mate. <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 3:25 am - Gerrard: Put the coma in to really hit the 'mate'
12/2/24, 3:26 am - Jono: NFL sucks arse
12/2/24, 3:26 am - Dave: Sorry mate, you got me, I’m lying for some reason
12/2/24, 3:27 am - James: Nah I believe you believe it
12/2/24, 3:29 am - Dave: If you ever bothered visiting me on the way over to frogland we could go to a game or two and you could actually have a firsthand opinion
12/2/24, 3:30 am - Dave: 🤷‍♂️
12/2/24, 3:30 am - James: No
12/2/24, 3:35 am - Gerrard: Dude, it's not our fault you moved to a place no one wants to visit
12/2/24, 3:42 am - Dave: Couldn’t even get you to visit the Coogee bay hotel mate
12/2/24, 3:42 am - Dave: You’ll be back
12/2/24, 3:43 am - James: You'd be surprised
12/2/24, 3:46 am - Gerrard: Hey does everyone want to go on holiday in Asia or Europe and experience beautiful scenery, great food and other people's cultures,
OR 
Visit America and get shot....?
12/2/24, 3:50 am - James: Yeah I'll postpone Japan this year to go to San Peudo to hang out with Dave
12/2/24, 3:54 am - Dave: Didn’t you win 40k on the horses and jet straight to North America for a “once in a lifetime” trip?
12/2/24, 3:55 am - James: Yeah look what's happened to him since he went there
12/2/24, 3:55 am - Dave: I know you want to sniff vending machine panties but a real mate would come LA
12/2/24, 3:55 am - James: Send links
12/2/24, 4:10 am - Gerrard: Canada, no to bang bang, yes to healthcare
12/2/24, 4:19 am - James: Nobody is going to the US to see you
12/2/24, 4:31 am - Dave: Canada not in North America? Thought you’d appreciate my careful choice of words
12/2/24, 4:38 am - Dave: Time of your life lad
12/2/24, 4:39 am - Gerrard: No one but you is saying north America, just America sucks
12/2/24, 4:39 am - James: Completed it mate
12/2/24, 4:39 am - Gerrard: This was before you sorted your life out too
12/2/24, 4:39 am - Gerrard: Rodwell is on everyone's wrong side of life <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 4:41 am - James: Look at me drinking and eating such filth
12/2/24, 4:41 am - James: Never again
12/2/24, 4:43 am - Dave: Always remember you being happy as larry when I was in Sydney. Sounds like I left and yours and James life went downhill 🤷‍♂️ Could just tell me you miss me?
12/2/24, 4:44 am - Gerrard: I was living a lie back then, drug and alcohol abuse
12/2/24, 5:06 am - Liam: I’ll come see you @14244893404 🫶🏻
12/2/24, 5:07 am - Liam: Is He off the bags? 🤔
12/2/24, 5:09 am - James: If he gets a flight paid for through work. He'll come see you 🛫
12/2/24, 5:10 am - James: Rodwell, you're better off just coming here. You know you hate it there
12/2/24, 5:10 am - Dave: Real mate
12/2/24, 5:10 am - Gerrard: Work trip?
12/2/24, 5:10 am - James: 100% only time
12/2/24, 5:11 am - Gerrard: Makes more sense for 1 plane ticket vs many
12/2/24, 5:11 am - Dave: Of course. Would never do a bag. Even if he went to a gig
12/2/24, 5:12 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 real friends
12/2/24, 5:12 am - James: Glad not part of my life anymore
12/2/24, 5:13 am - Gerrard: I'm glad I'm part of your new life, I'm sure @61404060785 is too
12/2/24, 5:13 am - James: Let's start our own group without these cancers <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 5:14 am - Liam: Are you on the bags too?
12/2/24, 5:14 am - James: And @61402741193
12/2/24, 5:14 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I didn't drink mid week until I met @14244893404 and @61478754484
12/2/24, 5:15 am - James: Liam can't drink
12/2/24, 5:15 am - Gerrard: He used to
12/2/24, 5:15 am - Gerrard: Maybe since Rodders left he's gone clean too
12/2/24, 5:15 am - James: Did he leave once things became expensive
12/2/24, 5:16 am - James: Who knows. Who cares frankly
12/2/24, 5:16 am - James: Better place now
12/2/24, 5:17 am - Gerrard: The air feels lighter
12/2/24, 5:27 am - Chris: Or glad to be part of your life?
12/2/24, 5:28 am - James: No you're in Chris ❤️
12/2/24, 5:37 am - Dave: @61478754484 and I will look forward to our invitation once you boys get bored of circle jerking and want someone to be toxic to again 🫠
12/2/24, 5:38 am - James: K bye
13/2/24, 12:42 pm - Jono: Fuck me I thought he was announced as our new manager for a hot minute
13/2/24, 9:36 pm - Chris: Some long term planning right there.
13/2/24, 9:42 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/QfU9NlPftOI?si=Ft5-iN3T-dyvGemz
13/2/24, 11:36 pm - Gerrard: Why is there less issues with moving between London clubs?
Is it because there's tons of them?
14/2/24, 12:12 am - James: They saying rice is overrated?
14/2/24, 12:22 am - Dave: There’s no issue with rice moving to Arsenal other than hammers crying because they lost their best player.  West ham aren’t a rival of Arsenal
14/2/24, 12:30 am - James: More successful in recent history though
14/2/24, 1:37 am - Dave: How you work that one out?
14/2/24, 1:38 am - James: They won conference last season
14/2/24, 1:44 am - Dave: ….
14/2/24, 1:48 am - James: You wouldn't celebrate that?
14/2/24, 1:48 am - James: Too good for you?
14/2/24, 1:50 am - Dave: Didn’t say that
14/2/24, 1:51 am - Dave: You’re absolutely right jimmety. West ham are far more successful than arsenal
14/2/24, 1:52 am - James: Didn't say that ya spaz
14/2/24, 1:52 am - James: So emotional
14/2/24, 2:16 am - Jono: https://x.com/officialvizeh/status/1757517449447055846?s=46&t=O7A3WAinzMcTPmYMqZ3Dpw

14/2/24, 2:42 am - Gerrard: At least, they're respected more
14/2/24, 2:43 am - Gerrard: In recent years.
14/2/24, 2:44 am - James: That's what I said
14/2/24, 2:44 am - James: Apparently not somehow
14/2/24, 2:44 am - Gerrard: European trophy vs 2nd and comm shield?
14/2/24, 2:45 am - Gerrard: I just think all of us have different qualifications for words
14/2/24, 2:45 am - James: You tell me
14/2/24, 3:13 am - Gerrard: Has anyone exposed that it's Jimmity's bday today yet?
14/2/24, 3:19 am - Dave: Is the FA cup worth less than beating European farmers in a comp no one watches?
14/2/24, 3:23 am - Chris: Oh, happy bday Jimmity
14/2/24, 3:24 am - Dave: Happy birthday brew ❤️😘
14/2/24, 3:25 am - Dave: 1.24 in https://youtu.be/7R5uTXGOQTs?si=J8T3s4nn2M-RRFZW
14/2/24, 3:25 am - Jono: Happy birthday Jimmity!
14/2/24, 3:27 am - Gerrard: You can't keep claiming an FA cup from 6years ago, and yes a European trophy has more requirements to get there.
14/2/24, 3:28 am - James: 'recent' last year right?
14/2/24, 3:28 am - James: So West Ham > Varsenal
14/2/24, 3:29 am - Jono: Rioooooooooo lol
14/2/24, 3:31 am - Gerrard: I think if you're comparing two teams then recent trophy's take more value in the calc
14/2/24, 3:31 am - Gerrard: Like a coefficient
14/2/24, 3:39 am - ~ Dave left
14/2/24, 3:42 am - James: He's gone

14/2/24, 3:45 am - James: No idea
14/2/24, 3:45 am - Liam: What have you done!
14/2/24, 3:53 am - Pero: Happy birthday Jimmy!!🎂🎂🍻🍻
14/2/24, 4:07 am - Gerrard: Was it the AFTV dancing gif?
14/2/24, 4:10 am - Jono: Where else will he gloat when Arsenal finish above LFC?
14/2/24, 4:17 am - Gerrard: In fantasy land? <This message was edited>

15/2/24, 12:15 am - Gerrard: I think you're projecting here, buddy.
15/2/24, 1:10 am - Gerrard: Yeah tweaked it again last match
15/2/24, 1:10 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 you know all about injuries innit

15/2/24, 9:17 am - Jono: You do wear it well though so I understand the obsession 😅
15/2/24, 9:26 am - Anthony: Haha yep my standard daily top. Then i put on my gunners pjs
15/2/24, 9:27 am - Anthony: Major full kit wanker
15/2/24, 11:26 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 can't believe you called him out like this
15/2/24, 11:27 am - Jono: I’ll pay for it
15/2/24, 11:53 am - Pero: Hopefully the keeper can give us a few free goals aswell
15/2/24, 11:54 am - Gerrard: So bitter, I know this is coming from a place of doubt.
15/2/24, 12:00 pm - Pero: Just saying would be nice to get a couple free goals like you guys did
15/2/24, 8:15 pm - James: Don't come back now. All the best

16/2/24, 2:41 am - Gerrard: I heard Getafe
16/2/24, 2:42 am - Gerrard: He would rape Arsenal like he did PSG
16/2/24, 2:42 am - Gerrard: Co-owner
16/2/24, 2:42 am - Gerrard: Co-managing director
16/2/24, 2:42 am - Gerrard: Co-manager
16/2/24, 2:43 am - Gerrard: Profit sharing
16/2/24, 2:43 am - James: He'd be better
16/2/24, 2:44 am - Dave: Already wearing an Arsenal shirt
16/2/24, 2:44 am - Dave: Thierry Mbappe 🤤
16/2/24, 2:47 am - Gerrard: It's weird thinking a player would prefer to go to Arsenal over other clubs, I still think of it as Chelsea and United being more of a pull.
@61452662705 thoughts?
16/2/24, 2:47 am - James: Manure are much bigger. Chelsea are more successful
16/2/24, 2:48 am - Gerrard: Might take more than one decent season to change people's mindsets
16/2/24, 3:52 am - Dave: Takes more than one title in 35 years to change people’s mindsets as well
16/2/24, 3:59 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 he's super sensitive since coming back into the group
16/2/24, 4:03 am - Dave: Na. You’re just obsessed. That dicking has really rattled you

17/2/24, 5:36 pm - Dave: With 15 goals and 13 assists you’d think so. But I guess the Optus social media intern also watches Rory Jennings for ball knowledge 🤷‍♂️

18/2/24, 2:36 am - James: Must say it was nice seeing Matt Ritchie score a goal along with annihilating the corner flag. Flash back to 2017

18/2/24, 2:48 am - Gerrard: First Bournemouth goal....

18/2/24, 2:50 am - Gerrard: Ritchie, first goal in four years
18/2/24, 2:50 am - James: And what a goal
18/2/24, 2:50 am - Gerrard: Lol
18/2/24, 2:50 am - James: Hope he does it next week at Emirates
18/2/24, 2:51 am - Gerrard: Easy 4-0 win for Newty
18/2/24, 2:51 am - James: Burn versus saka
18/2/24, 2:51 am - James: Christ
18/2/24, 2:51 am - James: Poor bloke getting rinsed every week
18/2/24, 2:51 am - Gerrard: Saka ain't him
18/2/24, 2:51 am - James: We'd outpace burn
18/2/24, 2:52 am - Gerrard: I just mean in general
18/2/24, 2:52 am - Gerrard: Not vs Burn
18/2/24, 2:52 am - James: Anything other than a huge win for Varsenal would be a failure in my eyes
18/2/24, 2:52 am - Gerrard: Arsenal are already a giant failure in my eyes
18/2/24, 2:52 am - James: I just can't argue with you when you're on fire like this
18/2/24, 2:52 am - Gerrard: KALVIN PHILLIPS SENT OFF 🤣🤣🤣

18/2/24, 2:55 am - James: Definitely can these days
18/2/24, 2:57 am - James: Rods typing
18/2/24, 2:57 am - Dave: I actually felt sorry for him when the red came out. Could see any shred of confidence he has left in his game fall out of his arse at that very moment in time
18/2/24, 2:57 am - James: Sure fire starter at the euros now
18/2/24, 2:58 am - Dave: Was Southgate at the game?
18/2/24, 2:58 am - James: Was watching hendo
18/2/24, 2:58 am - James: In training
18/2/24, 2:58 am - Dave: Wouldn’t have surprised me seeing his gormless face in the stands with a chub over Kalvin
18/2/24, 4:39 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 oh thank gawd, coming from Trey it's decided
18/2/24, 4:39 am - Dave: Well we have to post pointless opinions in here now after you ignore facts 🤷‍♂️
18/2/24, 4:39 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 did you watch the Burnley highlights?
I didn't.
18/2/24, 4:39 am - Gerrard: Curly typing....
18/2/24, 4:44 am - Dave: Saka statistically better than Foden and Palmer. What more do you want. Figured you’d listen if I started posting influencer opinions 😘
18/2/24, 4:44 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 he doesn't get it does he
18/2/24, 4:46 am - Pero: For a good 3 seconds after he kicked the ball I thought for sure it's going over the cross bar
18/2/24, 4:53 am - Dave: Send us another video from Jennings and co that I won’t watch
18/2/24, 4:55 am - Gerrard: Think that was all of us

18/2/24, 7:01 am - James: How do you block?
18/2/24, 7:16 am - Gerrard: I think Arteta puts 10 men across the box behind the ball and hopes for a long ball counter.
18/2/24, 7:23 am - James: I don't watch them no idea
18/2/24, 7:24 am - Gerrard: Heavens no, I've just heard about it

18/2/24, 7:58 am - James: Can't see anything
18/2/24, 7:59 am - Gerrard: Like no one but Arsenal fans can see Arsenal's title challenge?
18/2/24, 8:47 am - Gerrard: You see my friend @61452662705 you have factor in the inevitable bottle job drop of points so right now they're about 5th

20/2/24, 8:49 pm - James: Nap time?
20/2/24, 9:40 pm - Dave: Trying to get in Arteta’s head. Poor bloke is stressed with no energy
20/2/24, 9:40 pm - Dave: Etihad is so quiet lol
20/2/24, 9:41 pm - Dave: Brentford have had a couple of great counters
20/2/24, 9:41 pm - Dave: 🤞
20/2/24, 10:18 pm - Jono: City so predictable
20/2/24, 10:19 pm - Jono: Got lucky with that goal
20/2/24, 10:22 pm - James: Oh they're playing Luton next
20/2/24, 10:23 pm - James: So sambi is the difference maker or something?
20/2/24, 10:24 pm - Dave: Sounds like it
20/2/24, 10:25 pm - Dave: Brentford unlucky not to take anything from this game
20/2/24, 10:25 pm - James: Think they may play a weaker team with cup final up next?
20/2/24, 10:25 pm - James: Brentford show up against citeh don't they
20/2/24, 10:25 pm - James: Beat them last season I think
20/2/24, 10:26 pm - Dave: City didn’t look great today either. They’re definitely off the boil. It’s Liverpools to lose this season
20/2/24, 10:51 pm - James: Don't believe in your own club?
20/2/24, 10:56 pm - Dave: Course I do. But this is Liverpools season. Quadruple is one last present to Klopp before he sails off into the sunset
20/2/24, 10:57 pm - Jono: Lol
20/2/24, 10:57 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 Acceptance, stage 5
20/2/24, 10:58 pm - Dave: Maybe next season for us. City gets dragged through the courts and Liverpool hire big Sam 👍
20/2/24, 10:58 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 sorry, still in Denial
20/2/24, 10:59 pm - Dave: A lad can dream. Liverpool are the best team in the country
20/2/24, 11:04 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 he's flip flopping between the two, Acceptance again
21/2/24, 12:37 am - James: No wonder his gay uncle stuck his fingers up his bum bum
21/2/24, 1:32 am - Jono: Nketiah to come alive next season
21/2/24, 1:32 am - Jono: Toney will go to Chelsea

21/2/24, 6:26 am - Gerrard: @61422023136 sorry for the spelling mistake on Arsenal
21/2/24, 6:27 am - James: I like that it's dated

21/2/24, 6:27 am - James: ?
21/2/24, 6:28 am - James: Who wanted him?
21/2/24, 6:28 am - Gerrard: I heard City made an offer but I think it was to make Arsenal pay more

Fistys for everyone
21/2/24, 10:53 pm - Dave: Refs been shocking
21/2/24, 10:53 pm - Jono: lol
21/2/24, 10:53 pm - Jono: Not one shot on target and losing in the last minute
21/2/24, 10:53 pm - Dave: Porto players keep throwing themselves to the ground the moment we get the ball or set piece
21/2/24, 10:53 pm - Jono: Arsenal really hate Round of 16 don’t they?
21/2/24, 10:53 pm - Dave: And we just conceded a worldy with 20 seconds to go
21/2/24, 10:53 pm - Dave: Fantastic
21/2/24, 10:53 pm - Dave: lol
21/2/24, 10:54 pm - Jono: Didn’t Arsenal lose in the Rd of 16 in the Europa too?
21/2/24, 10:54 pm - Jono: Probably a blessing though for you lot. Can focus on catching us in the PL
21/2/24, 10:55 pm - Jono: Great morning
21/2/24, 10:55 pm - James: It's about that time of the season for varsenal
21/2/24, 10:56 pm - Jono: Poor fans went to Porto to watch that
21/2/24, 10:56 pm - Gerrard: Was it Messi's fault again?
21/2/24, 10:56 pm - Jono: At least it’s a beautiful city to explore
21/2/24, 10:56 pm - Gerrard: Everyone keep an eye out for new AFTV vids
21/2/24, 10:57 pm - James: Big step up between Porto and Burnley
21/2/24, 10:57 pm - Jono: It’s the no shots on target actually that interests me the most
21/2/24, 10:58 pm - Jono: With such a stacked front line
21/2/24, 10:58 pm - Jono: Against the 3rd best team in fucking Portugal
21/2/24, 10:59 pm - Pero: Sounds like we played like shit
21/2/24, 10:59 pm - Jono: Hopefully they recover at The Emirates
21/2/24, 10:59 pm - Gerrard: Standard innit

21/2/24, 10:59 pm - Pero: Hope so too
21/2/24, 10:59 pm - Gerrard: "He's done it AGAIN!!!"
21/2/24, 11:00 pm - Pero: Did pepe do anything wild ?
21/2/24, 11:00 pm - Liam: What a goal!
21/2/24, 11:00 pm - Gerrard: He wasted Arsenal's money
21/2/24, 11:00 pm - Dave: Porto defence played well to be fair. And they had some shite tactics where they just threw themselves to the ground the moment we had a set piece. Ref was trigger happy
21/2/24, 11:01 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 ref's fault innit
21/2/24, 11:01 pm - Dave: Need to come up with some answers in London
21/2/24, 11:01 pm - James: Varsey really hate 'competing' at all levels don't they
21/2/24, 11:01 pm - Gerrard: The answer is you a Conference league team <This message was edited>
21/2/24, 11:01 pm - Dave: Least we’re in it laddy laddison
21/2/24, 11:02 pm - Dave: You competing for top ten this year or just given up?
21/2/24, 11:02 pm - James: For a team that's fans proclaim them to be so great they're fucking miles behind Varpool and Citeh
21/2/24, 11:02 pm - Dave: Ah shit, we’ve got to play you on Saturday and I’ve just tempted fate 😭😂😂
21/2/24, 11:02 pm - James: @61409710717 think he a rattle
21/2/24, 11:03 pm - Gerrard: Rattle City bitch
21/2/24, 11:03 pm - Dave: Na. Knew it was too good to be true
21/2/24, 11:03 pm - James: Crayons are toxic to eat
21/2/24, 11:04 pm - James: @61409710717 how have varpy overtook artety so quickly
21/2/24, 11:08 pm - Gerrard: Extremely
21/2/24, 11:09 pm - Gerrard: Could turn you into an Arteta
21/2/24, 11:09 pm - James: Mincy Spaniard?
21/2/24, 11:09 pm - Gerrard: @61404060785 see Klopp playing the kids while Arteta doesn't even trust ESR
21/2/24, 11:10 pm - Gerrard: I was gonna say cry baby
21/2/24, 11:10 pm - Pero: Who did livo play ?
21/2/24, 11:11 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 Howie gives chances to youngsters that deserve it too right?
21/2/24, 11:12 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 read the bottom
21/2/24, 11:12 pm - Gerrard: "Give us Madrid"

@14244893404 you were asking for more Rory
21/2/24, 11:14 pm - James: He has had no option this season
21/2/24, 11:14 pm - James: Damn
21/2/24, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: But he's bold and brave enough to do it, Artsy doesn't even use his bench
21/2/24, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: Used one sub in a loss
21/2/24, 11:30 pm - Jono: Im sure the ref to blame too for not testing the keeper
21/2/24, 11:31 pm - Jono: Seen highlights of this kid in the U21s - he's really good
21/2/24, 11:32 pm - Jono: Porto should be minced up by end of 1st leg. Missed opportunity to play Smith Rowe at the Emirates in a dead rubber
21/2/24, 11:33 pm - James: Always var or the ref
21/2/24, 11:33 pm - Jono: Is today is Deeeesgrace too?
21/2/24, 11:33 pm - James: THe bALL WaS OUt
21/2/24, 11:33 pm - Jono: Haven't seen the presser
21/2/24, 11:33 pm - James: Humbling
21/2/24, 11:56 pm - Jono: Like this... https://x.com/snappedlfc/status/1760423371949449306?s=20
21/2/24, 11:58 pm - Jono: Even Milner was more of an attacking threat than anyone for the Arse today
22/2/24, 12:49 am - Gerrard: Rodders got two wake up calls in 24hrs
22/2/24, 12:59 am - Jono: That porto chance in the 1st half wow
22/2/24, 1:01 am - Dave: Porto? What was the second one?
22/2/24, 1:04 am - Gerrard: Curly.... it was literally called 'Dave's wake up call'
22/2/24, 1:09 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C3oOhmMtDj_/?igsh=MTVuOXVwdTE3dXR0NA==
Slurp slurp
22/2/24, 1:10 am - Gerrard: As much as Arsenal fans suck, they couldn't get that goal
22/2/24, 1:16 am - James: Arsenal season over?
22/2/24, 1:17 am - Dave: Not sure what the second wake up call is/was. Porto was surprising, should have beaten them 🤷‍♂️
22/2/24, 1:17 am - Gerrard: When was it under?
22/2/24, 1:17 am - Dave: Top 4 was the aim
22/2/24, 1:17 am - James: Winning league was the aim
22/2/24, 1:18 am - James: @61409710717 sick of this mentality that's its ok to spunk £1b for top four these days
22/2/24, 1:18 am - James: Remember when clubs were ridiculed for this
22/2/24, 1:19 am - Dave: Just happy to be in the running hey. Top 4 and champions league football was the goal ❤️ @61478754484 @61422023136 @61410933997
22/2/24, 1:20 am - James: @61409710717 what do you make of this. Do you have another chart
22/2/24, 1:20 am - James: Must qualify for a competition they have zero chance of winning anyway
22/2/24, 1:21 am - James: Top four better than FA Cup?
22/2/24, 1:22 am - James: Or is that Sky's fault for killing the most famous cup competition in the world by focusing on a few extra million for finishing an extra league position higher
22/2/24, 1:23 am - Jono: If Arsenal go out in Rd of 16 i think that brings 4 spots vs 5 spots back in the spotlight <This message was edited>
22/2/24, 1:23 am - Jono: Cmon Arse - do it for the good of the game. Manure dont deserve to be there
22/2/24, 1:34 am - Jono: 😮‍💨
22/2/24, 2:07 am - Jono: levels innit
22/2/24, 2:14 am - Dave: That’s why you’re winning the quad lads 💪 best team on the planet
22/2/24, 2:16 am - Dave: Great to see Klopp refraining from over-celebrating against Luton today. Only 4 bouts of running fist pumps, what a gentleman
22/2/24, 2:17 am - Jono: I’d be feeling that way too if I was a few months away from a gap year drinking all booze and seeing the world d
22/2/24, 2:18 am - James: He has no energy for that
22/2/24, 2:19 am - James: Being a multimillionaire football manager who probably doesn't even cut his own grass must be exhausting
22/2/24, 2:19 am - James: It's not a good look for pelaton
22/2/24, 2:21 am - Jono: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/11/arts/television/peloton-sex-and-the-city.html
22/2/24, 2:21 am - Jono: Not as bad as when this happened to Peloton lol
22/2/24, 2:27 am - James: There was some fella who was the face of subway and he got done for being a nonce
22/2/24, 2:28 am - James: Hasn't harmed them too much
22/2/24, 2:48 am - Gerrard: I'll sketch up how much money they have spent to stay as bottlers <This message was edited>
22/2/24, 3:09 am - Gerrard: Never rely on them to win
22/2/24, 3:10 am - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 good call eh
22/2/24, 3:10 am - Gerrard: Porto, completed it mate
22/2/24, 3:11 am - Pero: They worked against Liverpool?
22/2/24, 3:11 am - Gerrard: Should spend time with the family innit
22/2/24, 3:11 am - Gerrard: Work ain't everything
22/2/24, 3:11 am - Gerrard: Oh Pero.
Same tactics?
22/2/24, 3:12 am - Jono: I meant lose so Mancs don’t qualify from 5th
22/2/24, 3:12 am - Pero: Very happy to be in the champions league mix ❤️. Upto the coach to get a big win at home and turn it around again
22/2/24, 3:13 am - Gerrard: Put your house on it
22/2/24, 3:13 am - Pero: They were much better tactics you're correct
22/2/24, 3:14 am - Gerrard: Oh Pero, fighting the good fight.
@61452662705 he still believes
22/2/24, 3:16 am - Pero: Indeed we dominated and out classed the best team on the planet a couple weeks ago so the belief is there
22/2/24, 3:16 am - Dave: Ripped Liverpools pants down and gave them a hard spanking with those tactics. 0 shots on target wasn’t it?
22/2/24, 3:17 am - Pero: Yes I believe so ,total spanking
22/2/24, 3:18 am - Dave: Abused and toyed with the “future quad winners”. Sure we have the minerals to turn it around against little old Porto at home
22/2/24, 3:20 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 look at these guys glass half fulling it
22/2/24, 3:23 am - James: Rattle?
22/2/24, 3:24 am - James: Great shot!
22/2/24, 3:25 am - Dave: Just want to get this in early. If Liverpool don’t win the title from this point onwards with a 5 point lead, are we all agreed that it’s a bottle job?
22/2/24, 3:25 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 they wish they were us so hard!
22/2/24, 3:26 am - Dave: As if, you’re about to enter another 30 year trophy drought 😂😂😂😂
22/2/24, 3:27 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 bring up a former 30yr drought as they're currently in a 20yr drought
22/2/24, 3:28 am - Jono: It can’t be a drought though if he’s happy with 4th
22/2/24, 3:41 am - James: Is finished 4th a major honour now?
22/2/24, 3:41 am - James: Alongside charity shields
22/2/24, 3:41 am - Gerrard: Not that I remember
22/2/24, 3:41 am - James: They just happy to be finishing fourth thigh
22/2/24, 3:41 am - James: Though
22/2/24, 3:42 am - James: Billion pounds
22/2/24, 3:48 am - Jono: It is for small clubs
22/2/24, 4:17 am - Jono: I knew Peter Ly would come good eventually
22/2/24, 4:29 am - Dave: You not comprehending what’s happening here? I should jot it down on a notepad for you
22/2/24, 4:47 am - James: They lose to Porto or something?
22/2/24, 4:48 am - James: Porto mostly bar staff ain't they?
22/2/24, 4:48 am - Gerrard: What's Portuguese for Rattled?
22/2/24, 4:48 am - James: Varsey?
22/2/24, 4:48 am - Jono: Peri-Peri bad
22/2/24, 4:49 am - James: Hey they were invincible 30 years ago
22/2/24, 4:49 am - James: Except the 6 loses
22/2/24, 4:49 am - James: Twice to relegated Middlesbrough
22/2/24, 4:50 am - Gerrard: Arteta
22/2/24, 4:50 am - Gerrard: Invincible*

*In one comp
22/2/24, 4:50 am - James: They like one comp
22/2/24, 4:50 am - James: Bin the other three off innit
22/2/24, 4:50 am - James: So can focus on bottling one
22/2/24, 4:50 am - Gerrard: Also didn't the refs save them one match?
22/2/24, 4:51 am - James: Porto the shitist team in last 16?
22/2/24, 4:51 am - James: Any vids of aftv saying easy win?
22/2/24, 4:51 am - Gerrard: Well.... Arsenal are there
22/2/24, 4:52 am - Gerrard: Been on the go all day
22/2/24, 4:53 am - James: Varsey fans think they are citeh and varpools level?
22/2/24, 4:54 am - Gerrard: That is weird given their recent experiences as fans
22/2/24, 4:55 am - Gerrard: Imagine how they felt this morning when Luton was up 1-0 at the half
22/2/24, 5:00 am - James: Were they loud in ere
22/2/24, 5:01 am - James: Aren't Porto one of those clubs we all think are good because of the name but really they are shit
22/2/24, 5:01 am - James: Hang on
22/2/24, 5:01 am - James: No shots on target!?
22/2/24, 5:02 am - James: Imagine flying all the way to Portugal to not have an attempt at goal 😂✈️
22/2/24, 5:17 am - Gerrard: You can't rub out crayon
22/2/24, 5:17 am - Dave: You mean citehs level. Don’t buy into the “competition” propaganda. Chelsea have won a league title and a champions league against pep and they get laughed at every week. They’ve had the same success as Liverpool against city in the last 9 years
22/2/24, 5:18 am - Dave: Oh god that hurt that one didn’t it
22/2/24, 5:29 am - Dave: Keep tagging your mate, he’s going to flip his allegiance like a shit coin the moment you slip up 🤗

22/2/24, 5:53 am - Jono: An AFTV gold mine
22/2/24, 5:56 am - Dave: You’ve got some bollocks to make that comment haven’t you 😂😂😂
22/2/24, 5:57 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 he's got hate in his heart

@61452662705 not worth watching but just wanted to say that they didn't make halfway way before your mate started talking about Isak
23/2/24, 5:42 am - James: He is better though
23/2/24, 5:43 am - James: Just a sicknote
23/2/24, 5:43 am - James: The True Geordie and Nob Jockey Show?
23/2/24, 5:44 am - Gerrard: It's fucking horrible
23/2/24, 5:44 am - Gerrard: I clicked on one to see him blow up against Liverpool and now it pops up
23/2/24, 5:45 am - James: That bloke thinks he is thr best podcaster in the UK
23/2/24, 5:45 am - James: His worlds
23/2/24, 5:45 am - James: Words
23/2/24, 5:45 am - Gerrard: Not currently right?
23/2/24, 5:45 am - Gerrard: I'm sure he was popular before the Islamophobia thing
23/2/24, 5:46 am - James: Never that popular
23/2/24, 6:31 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 come get your mate
23/2/24, 10:19 am - Anthony: Who's getting their hectic fades here? @chatswood
23/2/24, 10:20 am - Anthony: https://maps.app.goo.gl/5GtwEFYUEY57cQUJ9
23/2/24, 10:32 am - Gerrard: Been there for years cuz
23/2/24, 10:32 am - Gerrard: You converting?
23/2/24, 10:37 am - Anthony: Haha nah just drove past. Wanted to see if it was decked out inside so i googled it
23/2/24, 10:38 am - Gerrard: I wouldn't ask any questions if you wanted to
23/2/24, 11:05 am - Pero: It looks dead

Love the fake torn hammy celebration 🤣
23/2/24, 10:55 pm - Dave: So glad we sold him
23/2/24, 10:56 pm - Dave: If there was one player we should have kept until he was leaving the pitch with a walking cane, it was Xhaka. So dumb to let him go. Was in the form of his life last season and look at leverkusen this season
23/2/24, 11:02 pm - James: What's a rattle
23/2/24, 11:29 pm - Gerrard: What's the odds???
23/2/24, 11:58 pm - Dave: I am rattled about the sale of xhaka
24/2/24, 12:00 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I see it as more of general rattled than anything in particular
24/2/24, 12:01 am - Dave: Predictions for tomorrow? You play very similar to porto against us. Suffocate us middle of the park and pray for a counter
24/2/24, 12:01 am - Gerrard: Rattled at Brekkie
24/2/24, 12:01 am - Dave: Effective to be fair
24/2/24, 12:01 am - Gerrard: Rattled in the supermarket
24/2/24, 12:02 am - Gerrard: Rattled at whatever evangelical church you go to on a Sunday
24/2/24, 12:02 am - Dave: You two are the most rattled lads in life I know unfortunately. Sometimes wonder if that’s why you’re so toxic in here to us innocent Arsenal fans
24/2/24, 12:04 am - Dave: Nothing wrong with being a man of god
24/2/24, 12:17 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/ZXjWk8l4eI8?si=cS26R-GJ9WyqyXRF
24/2/24, 12:39 am - Dave: Looking forward to this one
24/2/24, 12:39 am - Dave: See what the smooth brain company have to say today
24/2/24, 12:49 am - Jono: Great weekend for football../ watching a cup final and sweating on hopefully a few slips ups down below us
24/2/24, 12:49 am - Jono: 🤞🏼
24/2/24, 12:51 am - Gerrard: Newty are gonna win
24/2/24, 12:51 am - Gerrard: Who City got?
24/2/24, 12:52 am - Jono: Dave’s real team
24/2/24, 12:52 am - Gerrard: Ooooooo dilemma
24/2/24, 12:52 am - Gerrard: Sorry opposite of a dilemma
24/2/24, 12:53 am - Gerrard: Can his first team help his second team by taking points off City
24/2/24, 12:54 am - Jono: 🪇
24/2/24, 12:55 am - Gerrard: He's sounds like Rodders
24/2/24, 12:55 am - Dave: Hammers?
24/2/24, 12:55 am - Gerrard: Do you have three teams now?!
24/2/24, 12:55 am - Jono: Imagine talking about fairness with the wallet he’s been handed for transfers
24/2/24, 12:56 am - Jono: Poch would fit in to this group chat
24/2/24, 12:56 am - Gerrard: Might make Rodders look less rattled
24/2/24, 12:56 am - Dave: Was born in Havering, London. What’s my local team?
24/2/24, 12:56 am - Gerrard: Oh shit I said his name three times, here he comes
24/2/24, 12:58 am - Dave: Say it louder poch 💅

24/2/24, 2:27 am - Pero: Disgrace !
24/2/24, 2:28 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 see, Pero is a good sport - your mate on the other hand....
24/2/24, 2:49 am - James: Busy in here today
24/2/24, 2:50 am - James: Ratty?
24/2/24, 2:51 am - Gerrard: Newty haven't even beaten Arsenal yet and they rattling all over the place
24/2/24, 2:54 am - James: Ball was out
24/2/24, 2:57 am - Pero: Disgrace !

Another reason to hate him
24/2/24, 5:34 am - Dave: 💯 Obsessed with the Arsenal mate. 

It’s a good sign, means we’re close to winning some trophies again 💪
24/2/24, 9:11 pm - Jono: Karius is back baby
24/2/24, 9:12 pm - Jono: How good seeing Yanited get pantsed in the 97th minute
24/2/24, 9:12 pm - Jono: Sometimes Fergie OT time is a fun watch
24/2/24, 9:49 pm - Pero: Gunners pumping on all cylinders 💪 good half
24/2/24, 10:24 pm - Dave: SAAAAKKKAAAAAAAAAA
24/2/24, 10:24 pm - Pero: Saka !!🫶
24/2/24, 10:28 pm - Pero: So good Kiwior!!!!
24/2/24, 10:34 pm - Pero: Butcher Bruno G couldn't slash any meat today
24/2/24, 11:09 pm - James: Lovely stuff
24/2/24, 11:10 pm - James: I think I have covid. I'm dying so I don't have the energy. But well played. As good as you were we were equally as fucking awful ❤️ <This message was edited>
24/2/24, 11:20 pm - Pero: Dominated again
24/2/24, 11:21 pm - Pero: I was wondering either your phone was stolen or your 5g network exploded. Get well Jimmy !
24/2/24, 11:27 pm - Pero: Especially Iwobi scoring it after he had a few scuff shots throughout the game
24/2/24, 11:29 pm - Pero: Fun fact Iwobi, Willcock, xhaka , auba, gunners had 4 this morning... all in 1 week
25/2/24, 12:16 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0wqfBpovrG/?igsh=MWt4aHBvb3pxOXgwcw==
25/2/24, 12:36 am - Dave: Get better soon mate. Awful, yes. Astounded at how bad your defence was, schar in particular 👀
25/2/24, 12:38 am - James: Thanks. I think the midfield is shot tbh. Nobody pressing or tackling. Botman looks injured. At least Karius did no wrong again poor bloke
25/2/24, 12:39 am - James: Good to have players coming back and finally a player who can run with the ball in midfield with Willock. Nice goal too
25/2/24, 12:40 am - James: Burn with the assist 👀😂
25/2/24, 12:41 am - James: Saw the three min highlights and was thinking what a nob with those chances and then boom. So good
25/2/24, 4:41 am - Dave: Great goal. No keeper is saving that. 

Newcastle still had their moments where they looked dangerous. Just seem to be missing that spark in the midfield and so poor at the back. Almost unrecognisable from last season
25/2/24, 7:37 am - Pero: Never done before in premier league history
25/2/24, 8:24 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 how long will we have to suffer this mincebag behaviour of making up stats to feel good about?
25/2/24, 9:32 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 mate, your boys decided to forget how to defend today?
25/2/24, 4:43 pm - Jono: https://x.com/eplbible/status/1761775918882627863?s=48
25/2/24, 5:49 pm - Jono: Crazy hey
25/2/24, 5:50 pm - Jono: And we’re only not winning because of dodgy VAR <This message was edited>
25/2/24, 5:51 pm - Jono: Look at our team on the park now haha if we win from here it will be our greatest cup final win
25/2/24, 5:51 pm - Dave: Not watching it but you’re doing well to be competing with an injury list that long, even against Chelsea
25/2/24, 6:38 pm - Jono: THIS IS LIVERPOOL
25/2/24, 7:11 pm - Jono: Honestly
25/2/24, 7:12 pm - Jono: If you watch extra time half our players are either kids while the other half can hardly move
25/2/24, 7:13 pm - Jono: Chelsea brought on 5 supposed world class players
25/2/24, 7:13 pm - Jono: I was just waiting for the Chelsea goal tbh
25/2/24, 7:16 pm - Dave: Embarrassing. I thought they’d come out a different side this season with their new signings, poch and just the league and domestic comps to focus on. No excuses to be this bad
25/2/24, 7:17 pm - Jono: Anyway, justice served.

LFC win their 46th trophy in English football taking them back to clear top over Manure
25/2/24, 7:18 pm - Jono: Chelsea can eat a dick
25/2/24, 7:19 pm - Jono: https://x.com/not_motd/status/1761811886801064162?s=48

25/2/24, 8:37 pm - Gerrard: How's that not a red?
25/2/24, 8:40 pm - Gerrard: I feel that's taking away from Arsenal's lock on the title of BottleJobs, I guess it's a London thing
25/2/24, 9:50 pm - Dave: Find me one football fan wouldn’t pick rice

26/2/24, 3:38 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 if Arsenal get 2nd and Liverpool 3rd and the carabou cup - who's had the more successful season?
26/2/24, 3:44 am - James: Varpy
26/2/24, 3:45 am - James: But caraboo doesn't count remember
26/2/24, 3:45 am - Gerrard: Ah yeah forgot
26/2/24, 3:45 am - James: Varsenal too good for that
26/2/24, 3:45 am - Gerrard: Oh of course <This message was edited>
26/2/24, 3:45 am - James: They got bigger tingz
26/2/24, 3:46 am - Gerrard: Bigger..... Fish...... To...... Fry?
26/2/24, 3:47 am - Gerrard: Community shield winners medals VS Carabou cup runners up medals, which one has more value?
26/2/24, 5:22 am - James: Chelsea got to the final via merit
26/2/24, 5:22 am - James: (although it was trippier that handed it to them)
26/2/24, 5:45 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 could please send through all your drafts of the shittalk you were gonna post if Liverpool lost?
26/2/24, 6:03 am - Dave: Would never have posted shit talk. I was rooting for Liverpool today
26/2/24, 6:05 am - Gerrard: That's the difference between champions and Arsenal
26/2/24, 6:12 am - James: Lie
26/2/24, 6:14 am - Dave: Of course I’d rather Liverpool win than a rival London club. Was signing YNWA in my living room ❤️
26/2/24, 6:15 am - Gerrard: lies
26/2/24, 6:16 am - James: Chelsea ain't rivals they way more successful in recent history?
26/2/24, 6:16 am - Gerrard: true
26/2/24, 9:08 am - Gerrard: Is that an English thing?
26/2/24, 9:33 am - James: It's a type of inhaler for asthmatics
26/2/24, 9:34 am - Gerrard: Noice
26/2/24, 9:34 am - Gerrard: Maybe Arsenal should get some, might finally win something

26/2/24, 10:37 am - Pero: Ah right the lyrics haven't changed yet ?
26/2/24, 10:38 am - Gerrard: I'd say it doesn't matter which royal family member you're hating on

27/2/24, 12:00 am - Jono: Rio is a funny fucker
27/2/24, 12:33 am - Dave: Distinctly remember Villa going above Arsenal for a couple of weeks and everyone screaming “Emery is way better than arteta” and “is emery the best manager in the league?”
27/2/24, 12:34 am - Dave: No energy after all those celebrations
27/2/24, 12:34 am - Gerrard: He is better, just doesn't have the cheque book Arteta's daddy Edu has.
@61452662705
27/2/24, 12:35 am - Dave: 🤝
27/2/24, 12:36 am - Gerrard: Arteta wants to be respected so hard
27/2/24, 12:37 am - Dave: Won’t get an ounce of respect from rivals or neutrals until he wins major trophies
27/2/24, 12:38 am - Gerrard: Not even then, he's a Muppet with a bad attitude and zero class
27/2/24, 12:39 am - Pero: His team is playing class football atm
27/2/24, 12:39 am - Dave: <Media omitted>
27/2/24, 12:39 am - Gerrard: I'm just talking about him as a man
27/2/24, 12:40 am - Pero: Class !
27/2/24, 12:41 am - Gerrard: Typical Arteta fan, talking about someone's physical appearance, zero class
27/2/24, 12:45 am - Pero: 🪇
27/2/24, 12:46 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Pero's first rattle emoji, he's cracked
27/2/24, 12:52 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Curly bringing up results and stats, I'm two for two today
27/2/24, 12:53 am - Dave: Don’t think you realise how great it is to be an Arsenal fan right now. Nothing can rattle us
27/2/24, 12:54 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 everyone knows the first sign of not being rattled is, of course, saying you're not rattled
27/2/24, 12:57 am - Dave: Squad is an average age of 24, Arteta is going to be youngest manager to win the prem ever. Playing world class football and everyone is terrified of us. United are in the bin, Chelsea are in the bin, city are about to get dragged through the courts and Liverpools aging squad is injured across the board with a manager that is sailing off into the sunset. Never been a better time to be a gunner!!!
27/2/24, 12:59 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 how do you think people will look back in 10yrs at the Arteta era of not winning anything?
27/2/24, 1:02 am - James: Stop fucking tagging me whoever it is
27/2/24, 1:03 am - James: Vibrations in my pocket driving me mad
27/2/24, 1:03 am - Gerrard: @61452662705
27/2/24, 1:03 am - Gerrard: Put it on mute
27/2/24, 1:03 am - James: You are now
27/2/24, 1:03 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 😘
27/2/24, 1:03 am - James: There must be some rattling
27/2/24, 1:03 am - James: I'll catch up at lunch
27/2/24, 1:04 am - Pero: Rattle rattle rattle
27/2/24, 1:04 am - Pero: Up the gunners !!!
27/2/24, 1:27 am - Dave: “Whoever it is” LOL
27/2/24, 1:30 am - Gerrard: He doesn't assume like you guys assume Arsenal are gonna win something with Arteta
27/2/24, 1:32 am - Jono: No stopping the Gooners now - its all yours. Don't blow it
27/2/24, 1:33 am - James: All these goals mean nothing unless you win the league
27/2/24, 1:33 am - Dave: We’re not winning the league
27/2/24, 1:33 am - James: What's the point then?
27/2/24, 1:34 am - Dave: Like Trent said the other day, Liverpool are winning everything. Quadruple champs. Theirs to lose. If they don’t win everything now, biggest bottle jobs in the league
27/2/24, 1:35 am - Dave: Bottle memes for years to come, through the hard times while the next manager struggles to fill klipps boots
27/2/24, 1:35 am - Jono: It will only be considered a bottle job if Arsenal win it. If City do i think that's just what everyone expected anyway
27/2/24, 1:35 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I think the most important number is 3, as in 3rd
27/2/24, 1:36 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 off topic again
27/2/24, 1:36 am - Jono: Because given Citeh are 'back in the pack' so to speak, it will be considered a missed opportunity for their fiercest rival to take advantage of it
27/2/24, 1:36 am - Dave: Would have been nice if we were allowed to use that excuse last year 🙄
27/2/24, 1:37 am - Dave: 100%. That’s where we will probably finish. Maybe even lower
27/2/24, 1:37 am - Jono: Probably coz at one stage you were genuinely looking like winning it - AFTV were already calling it.
27/2/24, 1:37 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 I can't believe they still think bottlejobs is only referring to last season and not their entire identify
27/2/24, 1:38 am - Gerrard: Ever since that CL final
27/2/24, 1:38 am - Dave: Gaging a fan base using AFTV is like gaging Liverpool fans off Jonathon Morley and Pete boc 😂
27/2/24, 1:39 am - Jono: AFTV are the centre of the football universe imho
27/2/24, 1:39 am - Gerrard: I love how nothing they say can overcome their connection to AFTV

27/2/24, 2:19 am - Gerrard: Bradley played RW when Graven got injured
27/2/24, 2:20 am - Gerrard: A youngster rightback playing right wing in a final, Chelsea are fucking hopeless
27/2/24, 2:21 am - James: Scouse at work said some of the pictures weren't  representative

4/3/24, 9:42 pm - Dave: What’s the most we’ve ever won away? Was it 6-0 at Upton?
4/3/24, 9:43 pm - Dave: So we’ve got 50/55 mins to break another record we only broke 3 weeks ago @61422023136 ?

4/3/24, 10:03 pm - Dave: He got the assist for the own goal 💪
4/3/24, 10:04 pm - James: Actually just need him to have a shot on target
4/3/24, 10:04 pm - Dave: lol you’ll get that
4/3/24, 10:05 pm - James: He hasn't in 45
4/3/24, 10:05 pm - Pero: Saka will probably only get another 15min before being subbed he should get one in that time

4/3/24, 10:25 pm - James: Saka misses penalties
4/3/24, 10:25 pm - Jono: Foden > Saka though they can co exist

4/3/24, 10:28 pm - Dave: It’s like the saka vs salah argument. It isn’t an argument, Salah is statistically better. Same as Foden vs saka.
4/3/24, 10:28 pm - James: Show me saka's trophies
4/3/24, 10:28 pm - Dave: Facts over feelings jimmity
4/3/24, 10:28 pm - Gerrard: Arsenal are a joke and anyone playing for them are subpar
4/3/24, 10:28 pm - Gerrard: Win something
4/3/24, 10:29 pm - Dave: And don’t ask Liverpool fans, they’re shitting their pants right now so they’re not going to give you a genuine answer
4/3/24, 10:31 pm - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/p/C4GkHN6Aezi/?igsh=MXQ3azZoem8wMGU5dw==
It would be nice to see Xhaka win something
4/3/24, 10:32 pm - James: Saka is a lamb. Foden is a lion
4/3/24, 10:32 pm - Gerrard: Definitely taking Foden over Saka though
4/3/24, 10:32 pm - James: Saka cost us the euros
4/3/24, 10:33 pm - James: No wonder Southgate likes him
4/3/24, 10:33 pm - Gerrard: Saka is a one trick pony
4/3/24, 10:33 pm - James: Peas in a pod
4/3/24, 10:33 pm - Gerrard: Doesn't have winning in him
4/3/24, 10:33 pm - James: Only has a left foot and cuts in
4/3/24, 10:33 pm - James: Black Almiron
4/3/24, 10:33 pm - Gerrard: Against proper defenders he has nothing, Martinelli is better
4/3/24, 10:34 pm - Gerrard: English hype
4/3/24, 10:34 pm - Gerrard: Arsenal hype
4/3/24, 10:34 pm - Gerrard: Ty hype
4/3/24, 10:34 pm - Gerrard: When did all Arsenal supporters turn into Ty?
4/3/24, 10:43 pm - Dave: Strange comment, scores some belters with his right
4/3/24, 10:44 pm - Pero: Arsenal are a steam train atm the top 2 teams are nervous
4/3/24, 10:45 pm - Gerrard: Ty
4/3/24, 10:45 pm - Gerrard: Ty
4/3/24, 10:52 pm - James: Couldn't even score 8
4/3/24, 10:52 pm - James: Saka couldn't even test the keeper
4/3/24, 10:54 pm - Gerrard: Poor Arsenal fans, these sort of results give them hope, gonna be brutal this bottle <This message was edited>
4/3/24, 11:13 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/zaeNXol-B7I?si=DwLVe1mbrbB8EYmd
4/3/24, 11:35 pm - Dave: Can’t bottle a lead we don’t have. Only Liverpool can do that 😁
5/3/24, 3:06 am - Gerrard: I'm sure Arsenal will find a way
5/3/24, 3:07 am - Dave: Sunday predictions for the title decider?
5/3/24, 3:09 am - Gerrard: City win then Arsenal beat City to hand Liverpool the title.
5/3/24, 3:21 am - Gerrard: Then Arsenal will drop points to some nothing teams.

5/3/24, 6:24 am - Dave: Just happy to be in the conversation ❤️ we all know Quaderpool will be lifting all the trophies this season
5/3/24, 6:29 am - Jono: Haha fucking hell they must have a lot of faith in our academy boys
5/3/24, 6:29 am - Jono: 😝
5/3/24, 6:29 am - Jono: Gooners should be higher
5/3/24, 6:29 am - Jono: At least 25%
5/3/24, 6:30 am - Jono: Probs lower coz they still gotta play City away
5/3/24, 6:30 am - Dave: I’m going to go out on a limb here and say we win that game
5/3/24, 6:31 am - James: They saying varpools reserves are better than Varsenals fully strength team
5/3/24, 6:31 am - Dave: Actually agree with jez for once. We’ll fuck it up against someone that we should be smashing
5/3/24, 6:31 am - James: *academy
5/3/24, 6:38 am - Dave: Clearly not better, Liverpool have beaten Arsenal once in the past 5 meetings. Only difference this season, is Klopp’s experience and the farewell tour momentum shining through
5/3/24, 6:40 am - Jono: Got a feeling BOTH this weeks game plus that one will be DRAWS
5/3/24, 6:41 am - Jono: So league will be won and lost from how each team travels in their other games
5/3/24, 6:44 am - Dave: I think you’ll beat city on Sunday. It’s at Anfield and they haven’t been 100% this season
5/3/24, 6:48 am - Jono: Big call. Salah back will help unless he gets injured again for his cameo mid week
5/3/24, 6:49 am - Jono: I think our biggest loss now is Jota tbh
5/3/24, 6:49 am - Jono: Bloke was almost unplayable
5/3/24, 6:51 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 why is Ty arse kissing Livo?
5/3/24, 7:30 am - Dave: This sound like an arse kiss jezzy
5/3/24, 7:35 am - Pero: As it stands on form and momentum arsenal will win the league this year. But it's going to be a cracking couple of months of premier league, so exciting and nerve racking every week!!

5/3/24, 5:26 pm - Dave: *Liverpool fans last season were saying “look at these United fans celebrating this trophy like the league, it’s fucking embarrassing. We don’t even celebrate the Carabao cup”

5/3/24, 9:24 pm - Dave: Arsenal living in Liverpools heads rent free to respond with that. Everyone knows you’re on borrowed time lol. 99th minute winners against forest with reffing errors and we’re emptying stadiums before half time weekly hey @61422023136 @61478754484
5/3/24, 9:24 pm - Gerrard: @61404060785 @61452662705 not rent free at all
5/3/24, 9:35 pm - Dave: Borrowed. Time
5/3/24, 9:37 pm - Gerrard: @61404060785 @61452662705 Not. Rent free.
6/3/24, 2:17 am - Dave: Danger?
6/3/24, 2:18 am - Dave: We are doing a Belgium lol. Every day the FA keeps Southgate on will be another day of failure
6/3/24, 2:18 am - Gerrard: You gotta talk to Schwarzy about that
6/3/24, 2:19 am - Dave: Won’t win a bean with Southgate. Guys shite
6/3/24, 2:20 am - Gerrard: Why is it that you can be so rational with Southgate and England but you can't see the same with Arteta and Arsenal?

7/3/24, 1:06 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 I also heard that the team with most points wins the league!
7/3/24, 1:07 am - Dave: Don’t shoot the messenger pal. Just delivering the news from your hero Simon
7/3/24, 1:14 am - James: Such a tory toss pot
7/3/24, 1:19 am - James: Who cares what he thinks?
7/3/24, 1:19 am - James: Johnny Evans starts in front of him

7/3/24, 3:28 am - James: He knows it means more to certain people who aren't him
7/3/24, 3:28 am - James: Citeh only probably been more successful
7/3/24, 3:28 am - James: Probably though
7/3/24, 3:29 am - Dave: “Probably”
7/3/24, 3:30 am - Dave: Have city even spent more than Liverpool since Klopp joined @61452662705 ?
7/3/24, 3:31 am - Dave: Can someone fact check this for the benefit of Trent and Trent’s feelings
7/3/24, 3:33 am - Jono: Net spend
7/3/24, 3:34 am - Jono: https://www.planetfootball.com/quick-reads/liverpool-manchester-city-net-spend-jurgen-klopp-pep-guardiola-transfers
7/3/24, 3:34 am - Jono: Pep nearly triple the net spend
7/3/24, 3:34 am - Jono: In both their tenures
7/3/24, 3:35 am - James: You getting mugged off? @14244893404
7/3/24, 3:35 am - Jono: If we're talking just spend
7/3/24, 3:36 am - Jono: 1.18 billion Pep
680 million Klopp
7/3/24, 3:37 am - Jono: Defending Citeh though is what shocks me the most out of this dodgy argument
7/3/24, 3:37 am - Jono: For shame on you
7/3/24, 3:37 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 funny how someone can say something everyone thinks and knows but if it comes from someone that Curly hates the it's bad 🤷🏼‍♂️
7/3/24, 3:37 am - James: 😲😲😲
7/3/24, 3:38 am - Dave: Shame pep didn’t inherit a £160m player hey @61452662705. Klopp has spent more than pep. Facts only
7/3/24, 3:38 am - Jono: My article above was from 2023 so probs missing last summers purchases
7/3/24, 3:38 am - James: 🫣
7/3/24, 3:38 am - James: 🫨
7/3/24, 3:38 am - James: 😳
7/3/24, 3:39 am - Dave: Question
7/3/24, 3:39 am - Jono: What's right then
7/3/24, 3:39 am - Dave: Did pep spend more or Klopp? Who cares about net spend, no one cares if pep is a better businessmen or vice versa
7/3/24, 3:39 am - Dave: Who spent more on players in Klopp’s tenure
7/3/24, 3:40 am - Jono: Didn't the article above show the total spend
7/3/24, 3:40 am - Jono: Or am i missing something
7/3/24, 3:40 am - Dave: I see 807m for Klopp and 692m for pep from 2015 to today
7/3/24, 3:40 am - Jono: Is that an article?
7/3/24, 3:40 am - Jono: Or just a google blurb

7/3/24, 3:41 am - Jono: I'll do Man City
7/3/24, 3:41 am - Jono: You do LFC @14244893404
7/3/24, 3:42 am - Gerrard: Also do squad value when arriving
7/3/24, 3:42 am - Jono: Haha we had Jon Flano right back
7/3/24, 3:43 am - Gerrard: The madness!!!!
7/3/24, 3:44 am - Jono: Since Pep arrived
7/3/24, 3:44 am - Jono: In euros btw hence the diff numbers
7/3/24, 3:45 am - Jono: No idea how to figure out squad value at the time of taking on role
7/3/24, 3:45 am - Gerrard: Curly loves talking euros
7/3/24, 3:46 am - Jono: Still less spend than City even with the extra year (ignore the City figure)
7/3/24, 3:48 am - Jono: Squad values when taking over. Not a huge gap but city still well ahead
7/3/24, 4:24 am - Jono: I'm just here for facts when it comes to teams like Citeh. I've said a million times on here they're the REAL enemy here. 

I completely understand if Rodwell wanted to spill some Arsenal agenda / propaganda that made them look infinitely superior to us, coz thats what fans do. 

But Citeh?? Get farrrrrked <This message was edited>
7/3/24, 4:52 am - Dave: Ok. So contrary to popular belief that I’ve been sat here scouring the internet for facts that fit my agenda, I actually just went out for a family walk after dropping a couple of grenades in the group chat
7/3/24, 4:54 am - Dave: I legitimately don’t know who’s spent more on transfers since Klopp joined. I just knew there wasn’t a whole lot of difference in it,
which is why I questioned it, because it always tickles me when I hear Liverpool fans (and now players), crying about how they have a budget similar to Lutons
7/3/24, 4:56 am - Dave: I quickly pulled this clip from a daily fail article that was the top of my Google search of “city vs liverpool total spend since 2015” so I’m sure it’s inaccurate. 

I’ll go look at transfer market and be back in 5
7/3/24, 4:57 am - Gerrard: Whatever bro, every time you get absolutely cooked in here you try to claim "oooooo I was just trying to get everyone going haw haw haw". <This message was edited>
7/3/24, 4:57 am - Jono: Might need to send @61422023136's City jersey over to @14244893404
7/3/24, 4:58 am - Dave: No one got cooked and it was a total feeding frenzy in here. Got a little chub on seeing the 50 unread messages when I walked through the door
7/3/24, 4:58 am - Gerrard: AFTV innit
7/3/24, 4:58 am - Gerrard: "I didn't get cooked innit"
7/3/24, 4:59 am - Jono: Everyone else's 2nd team is Citeh in truth. That's fine, i understand. 
Arsenal fans didn't even seem that butthurt they lost the league last year to them
7/3/24, 4:59 am - Jono: All to hopefully not see us win it. I get that.
7/3/24, 4:59 am - Gerrard: Used to it
7/3/24, 4:59 am - Dave: “Faaaarrr out, youse ‘ear davo thought livos playa spendo was higho than cities”
7/3/24, 5:00 am - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 @61452662705
7/3/24, 5:00 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I won't be the first to say it....
7/3/24, 5:00 am - James: My gosh
7/3/24, 5:00 am - Dave: No one gives a fuck about city, that’s why. They have no historical
rivalry with anyone because they were shit, and now just an oil club
7/3/24, 5:01 am - Dave: I hate United and Chelsea. Liverpool I didn’t have an issue with until I met you @61409710717
7/3/24, 5:01 am - Gerrard: Curly loves Pep ❤️
7/3/24, 5:01 am - Dave: Hate spurs but they’re irrelevant
7/3/24, 5:04 am - Jono: Makes this all sound like a huge waste of time then innit
7/3/24, 5:06 am - Jono: One can only hope they get fucked over by the charges but even then I don’t think it would it matter as they’ve already killed off the vibe by dominating for so long with their shitty oil money and likely rule breaking which they’ll find a dodgy way to avoid punishment on. 

Hand on heart I’d have much less pain watching Arsenal winning it than Citeh.
7/3/24, 5:07 am - Jono: United would be the only team I’d probably hope would avoid winning the league at the hands of Citeh. But that comes naturally as a Red
7/3/24, 5:10 am - Dave: Definitely time for city’s reign to end. Equally would hate for either of us to win due to an FA punishment.
7/3/24, 5:10 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 after telling me that everyone in England hates Liverpool and the "way their fans are over there".
7/3/24, 5:10 am - Dave: Never said that. Odd lie to make up
7/3/24, 5:11 am - Dave: I’m going to the liverpool pub in long beach on Sunday at 8:30am to cheer on the reds 🤷‍♂️
7/3/24, 5:11 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 he remembers everything he's ever said
7/3/24, 5:13 am - Dave: Liverpool hate the rest of England. We don’t hate Liverpool
7/3/24, 5:13 am - Dave: Think you got it mixed up
7/3/24, 5:13 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 why does your friend lie so much?

8/3/24, 5:15 am - Dave: You getting all these digs in before banter club era returns for the next 30 years?
8/3/24, 5:15 am - Dave: You better not bitch out again and go AWOL in the group like you did last season
8/3/24, 5:15 am - Gerrard: Just facts, not hopes like your comments
8/3/24, 5:15 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 so much anger in him

9/3/24, 8:44 pm - Dave: Quiet in here
9/3/24, 8:44 pm - Jono: Good win. Havertz lucky to be on the park for his goal after that dive though
9/3/24, 8:44 pm - Jono: Just saying…
9/3/24, 8:45 pm - Dave: We should have had multiple pens and that rammers clanger gifted them the first goal. Brentford very fortunate it was only 2-1
9/3/24, 8:46 pm - Jono: Big one tonight though. Arsenal could stay top and be back in the bottling position 😬
9/3/24, 8:46 pm - Jono: I still think draw
9/3/24, 9:01 pm - Dave: Only team that’ll be bottling it this season is Liverpool sir. Was yours to lose 😬
9/3/24, 10:44 pm - Pero: Rammers gave me a heart attack

10/3/24, 12:41 am - Dave: So predictable 🎣 knew you’d be on that like a ferret up a drainpipe
10/3/24, 12:41 am - Gerrard: Oh again, hey everyone He Did It On Purpose
10/3/24, 12:52 am - Dave: Awfully touchy today 🪇
10/3/24, 1:16 am - James: 😲
10/3/24, 1:21 am - Gerrard: I am shocked too
10/3/24, 1:57 am - Gerrard: And to Arsenal fans, winning the community shield was like winning the champions league to us.

10/3/24, 9:41 am - Jono: Gets worse with every viewing
10/3/24, 9:42 am - Jono: I wonder if they gave it a pen, if that would’ve meant a red was gonna follow on review.

10/3/24, 12:01 pm - Pero: It's not shockingly bad there was hip contact. 
Not cardable
10/3/24, 4:51 pm - Dave: Forgetting Trossard getting choke slammed in the box 10 mins prior as well.
10/3/24, 5:34 pm - Dave: Are Liverpool going to turn up today?
10/3/24, 5:39 pm - Jono: Got a bad feeling about this one. Difference in experience in key positions killing us. Soft goal
10/3/24, 5:52 pm - Dave: Pen!!!!

10/3/24, 5:56 pm - Jono: Go on lads

10/3/24, 6:07 pm - Chris: What a pass from salah
10/3/24, 6:28 pm - Dave: Will be surprised if Liverpool don’t get 3 points from this. Been all Liverpool second half. City look rattled
10/3/24, 6:29 pm - Jono: Some good playbook material for Arsenal and their trip to the Emptihad
10/3/24, 6:29 pm - Jono: I can’t see a winner here. The chances have already come
10/3/24, 6:46 pm - Jono: High foot in the chest gets given a free kick anywhere else on the park
10/3/24, 6:47 pm - Jono: No pen though
10/3/24, 6:54 pm - Jono: https://x.com/ftblbalr/status/1766884236085141806?s=46
10/3/24, 6:54 pm - Jono: You be the judge
10/3/24, 6:55 pm - Jono: I can’t believe it hey 😅🤣
10/3/24, 7:12 pm - Dave: Touch and go. I thought they were going to give it if I’m being honest.
10/3/24, 7:13 pm - Dave: It was soft as shit, and he did get the ball first. Mac was definitely looking for it. Probably should have been awarded <This message was edited>
10/3/24, 7:16 pm - Jono: Comes off Maccas chest first before Doku touches the ball
10/3/24, 7:17 pm - Jono: But anyway, I’m more annoyed with the chances we didn’t take to win it
10/3/24, 9:47 pm - James: What happened this morning
10/3/24, 10:12 pm - James: So citeh smash Varsenal at emptyhad next?
10/3/24, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: Huge result, would've been better if VAR would've shown up.
But now Liverpool win all their remaining games and win the league.

10/3/24, 11:20 pm - James: Varsenal cheating again?
10/3/24, 11:20 pm - Gerrard: Sadly looks like VAR is from London
10/3/24, 11:21 pm - James: Oh
10/3/24, 11:21 pm - James: Citeh Varsenal next up
10/3/24, 11:21 pm - James: Haven't varsey got a CL game midweek?
10/3/24, 11:21 pm - James: Citeh have a week off?
10/3/24, 11:21 pm - Gerrard: I had a dream we lost 8-2 and Kelleher broke his collarbone, so much better reality
10/3/24, 11:22 pm - Gerrard: Porto innit.....
10/3/24, 11:22 pm - Gerrard: Porto ain't Burnley or Sheffield
10/3/24, 11:23 pm - James: So citeh fully rested?
10/3/24, 11:23 pm - Gerrard: I think they'll be flying after not losing today
10/3/24, 11:37 pm - Gerrard: Looks like Arsenal is in a top 4 race innit
11/3/24, 12:02 am - Dave: You’re worse than Klopp lad <This message was edited>

11/3/24, 12:07 am - Gerrard: @61422023136 an Arsenal fan yesterday told me that Arsenal have a better chance this year than they did last year
11/3/24, 12:08 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 do we now say if Arsenal don't win from this position then it's a bottle.....?
11/3/24, 12:12 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/CR5ufrL3vq8?si=t241l39XeELtgAac
11/3/24, 12:13 am - Dave: Liverpool bottled it if they don’t win title. Zero difference to last season for Arsenal
11/3/24, 12:13 am - Dave: I actually think Liverpool will win title after today. Convinced
11/3/24, 12:13 am - Dave: Klopp’s elite at switching up tactics
11/3/24, 12:13 am - Dave: You looked shite first 30 mins and Klopp switched it up, made city look average
11/3/24, 12:14 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 @61452662705 if Arsenal do go on to win then LiVARpool has to be retired for ever and VARsenal has to be locked into their official branding
11/3/24, 12:29 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/vm9NLGvR7c0?si=iEJVjl4uowBaKHSr
11/3/24, 12:29 am - Gerrard: Starting to miss Klopp now <This message was edited>

11/3/24, 12:32 am - James: I think villa are on a weird one atm so Ange may get 4th
11/3/24, 12:33 am - James: They'll probably go all out for conference
11/3/24, 12:39 am - James: You're top?
11/3/24, 12:40 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 are we allowed to look at the table yet?
11/3/24, 12:41 am - James: Na so much can change
11/3/24, 12:41 am - James: You can look at sheff utd
11/3/24, 1:02 am - Gerrard: But remember the small teams always try their best against the top teams
11/3/24, 1:54 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 he tries so hard, little scamp
11/3/24, 4:37 am - Dave: This your account?
11/3/24, 6:07 am - James: Varsenal deffo not winning with that run in
11/3/24, 6:08 am - Gerrard: I can't help but agree
11/3/24, 7:41 am - Dave: Never were winning it. We’re grounded mate, not talking about winning quads over here
11/3/24, 7:42 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 are you special?
11/3/24, 10:09 am - Gerrard: No Arsenal managers or teams there

11/3/24, 10:16 am - Liam: That was a penn
11/3/24, 10:16 am - Liam: But not clear and obvious.
11/3/24, 10:42 am - James: Thought he was looking for it tbh
11/3/24, 10:43 am - Gerrard: Stooge to the refs
11/3/24, 11:06 am - Liam: Ref had no excuse should have gave a pen.
11/3/24, 11:07 am - Liam: VAR I think should go with the on field decision, ref saw it. Right in front of him
11/3/24, 11:08 am - Gerrard: Think the ref was on the other side
11/3/24, 11:08 am - Gerrard: Whole ref system is fucked
11/3/24, 11:49 am - Pero: Agreed he jumped into the ball with his arm which made it grey, it would of been handball against macca otherwise
11/3/24, 11:53 am - Gerrard: This kind of dribble doesn't befit you as a gentleman, Anthony.
11/3/24, 11:54 am - Pero: It's why they didn't give it a pen just facts gezza
11/3/24, 11:55 am - Gerrard: I can't believe how different you are in real life compared to in here, living two lives
11/3/24, 11:57 am - Pero: These are the reasons they didn't give it , if it was 1000% clear it would of been given
11/3/24, 11:58 am - Pero: Lots of teams have been coping these calls
11/3/24, 11:58 am - Gerrard: Fiction

12/3/24, 12:42 am - James: I saw Isak goal on twitter
12/3/24, 12:45 am - Gerrard: Murphy goal looked nice
12/3/24, 12:46 am - Gerrard: It wasn't the Newty goals that were the problem
12/3/24, 1:11 am - James: No problems scoring goal
12/3/24, 1:11 am - James: Goals
12/3/24, 1:13 am - Jono: Isak's goal was class. He loves that move though. Defenders need to do their homework more
12/3/24, 1:32 am - James: No stopping what can't be stopped
12/3/24, 1:33 am - Gerrard: Like the executioners axe coming down, it's inevitable

12/3/24, 5:57 am - Jono: That could sure do with a brick wall of that variety around the whole of Gaza
12/3/24, 6:13 am - Dave: Those players aren’t getting back on the flight home
12/3/24, 6:13 am - Gerrard: We did it for the Iraqi team back in the day, too.
12/3/24, 6:13 am - Dave: Just scored yourself some new refugees
12/3/24, 6:14 am - Dave: Was that the game you won 27-0?
12/3/24, 6:14 am - Gerrard: Have you lived in America so long that you start to be concerned about your own borders?
12/3/24, 6:16 am - Dave: I’m not concerned about borders whatsoever. I’m a lib 🌈 ❤️ 🔵
12/3/24, 6:17 am - Gerrard: bulshit you bleed Republican red
12/3/24, 6:18 am - Gerrard: You're a full-blooded Trumper. Only comes second to Anthony.
12/3/24, 6:30 am - Dave: I’m voting Kennedy 😍
12/3/24, 6:31 am - Gerrard: Fuck. Yeah, no vax.
12/3/24, 6:37 am - Dave: Well if it’s a choice of the orange man, the senile pant shitter or the only guy that’s calling out corrupt corporations. Know who I’d go for
12/3/24, 6:37 am - Gerrard: You sound pretty impartial.
12/3/24, 6:37 am - Dave: Doesn’t have a chance though so I’m sure we will have orange man again
12/3/24, 6:38 am - Gerrard: So you'll come back to Australia then?
12/3/24, 6:38 am - Dave: I dislike both sides
12/3/24, 7:06 am - James: They'll never be Aussies though even if they get a passport
12/3/24, 7:07 am - Gerrard: That's only for the English.
12/3/24, 7:13 am - Gerrard: Like you guys
12/3/24, 7:13 am - Gerrard: The ones who don't try to assimilate
12/3/24, 9:26 am - James: No

13/3/24, 1:24 am - Jono: I saw they had a Pepe
13/3/24, 1:24 am - Jono: But that was a young Pepe not the ET old looking one
13/3/24, 1:24 am - Jono: Or is that Pepe still there?
13/3/24, 1:24 am - Jono: Didn't watch
13/3/24, 1:25 am - Gerrard: To be fair, I can't barely name a player in the Arsenal team
13/3/24, 1:26 am - Jono: Arsenal aren't playing till April 1st now. Lucky things.
13/3/24, 1:26 am - Jono: Plenty of time to recharge

13/3/24, 1:41 am - James: As someone who has witnessed my team get to many  QFs, semis and finals, it really is nothing to wank about
13/3/24, 1:42 am - Gerrard: It's huge for small teams
13/3/24, 1:52 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/6FNjm8JQfC0?si=hGK5NxqDU5oUNXOD
13/3/24, 2:04 am - Dave: We won’t be expecting a social media post when you qualify for the Europa league quarters then. 

Heard you’ll get a whopping 1m prize money for reaching them, Varpool be able to afford darwizzys crayons for a few more months 💪
13/3/24, 2:06 am - Jono: Apparently UEFA have booked another stadium in Dublin in case LFC and Rangers make the final 😅
13/3/24, 2:07 am - James: Nonni eats $500k worth of crayons a month!?
13/3/24, 2:08 am - Dave: Heard he’s been stress eating them since pappi klopp announced his abandonment
13/3/24, 2:11 am - James: Sticking them up his arris
13/3/24, 2:49 am - Gerrard: Is he trying to get the crayons off his record?
13/3/24, 3:36 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4YQ4drtYC7/?igsh=Z21lMzhxNGFlbm4y
13/3/24, 3:36 am - Gerrard: Fuck the huns

13/3/24, 4:54 am - Gerrard: Poor imports getting blamed for false media, @61460027550 remember us being there?
13/3/24, 4:54 am - Dave: Was just about to send this 😂😂😂
13/3/24, 4:54 am - Dave: Anfield speakers strike again innit @61452662705
13/3/24, 4:54 am - Gerrard: I remember coins getting thrown and the "how long was your flight chants?"
13/3/24, 4:55 am - Gerrard: Then Liverpool scored and the whole section started flipping off the away section
13/3/24, 4:58 am - Gerrard: Don't be upset that we have fun without you
13/3/24, 5:01 am - Gerrard: We weren't either, in Australia mate
13/3/24, 5:02 am - Dave: Imports? 🤔🫣
13/3/24, 5:04 am - Gerrard: You think I was in Liverpool 48hrs ago?
13/3/24, 5:05 am - Gerrard: Did you hit your head again?
13/3/24, 5:24 am - Dave: “Poor imports”
13/3/24, 5:24 am - Gerrard: Don't you know anything?
13/3/24, 5:25 am - Gerrard: The section to the right of the away section is all the foreign sports packages
13/3/24, 5:26 am - Gerrard: Fuck you're thick
13/3/24, 5:28 am - James: 😲
13/3/24, 5:29 am - Gerrard: Enjoying the show
13/3/24, 5:49 am - James: Rafa sacked again
13/3/24, 5:49 am - James: What a downfall
13/3/24, 5:51 am - Dave: I was more nodding at you having the cheek to call a foreign supporter a poor import. Think you walk around talking to yourself with a scouse accent, identity crisis
13/3/24, 5:52 am - Gerrard: I think he did hit his head
13/3/24, 5:52 am - Gerrard: Get him back!
13/3/24, 5:53 am - Dave: Poor even by your standards
13/3/24, 8:01 am - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣 I bet these lot in here were doing the same

13/3/24, 9:33 pm - Dave: Way better
13/3/24, 9:36 pm - Jono: Joe Gomez got in
13/3/24, 9:37 pm - Jono: Who’d have thought that a year or so ago
13/3/24, 9:52 pm - Chris: I'd rather he be left out
13/3/24, 9:53 pm - Jono: Doubt he’ll get a run
13/3/24, 9:59 pm - James: I heard he was out 7 months?

I fucking told you guys that this fuck has no class
14/3/24, 2:08 am - James: Wow
14/3/24, 2:08 am - James: Horrible little man
14/3/24, 2:08 am - Gerrard: He's got a track record of disrespect
14/3/24, 2:14 am - Dave: You clearly don’t know the track history of Portos little bitch
14/3/24, 2:14 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 victim blaming
14/3/24, 2:15 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 so this excuses Arteta from his poor behaviour
14/3/24, 2:23 am - Pero: I agree conceicao seems to be bitch like with his comment after the game saying "if only you knew how hard we worked at training and the tactics we worked on, then you'll understand we are the team who deserve to be in the quarter finals , not arsenal "

Ok mate sure
14/3/24, 2:24 am - Pero: But if arteta did say something about his family that wouldn't be good. But let arteta say his version . It could of been Spanish translation misinterpretation  again
14/3/24, 2:24 am - Dave: Conceicao has a history. It’s part of his mind games
14/3/24, 2:25 am - Dave: Porto were king of the mind games and playing to their ability. They deployed so many dark art tactics.
14/3/24, 2:27 am - Dave: Even down to making Arsenal wait to take the pens. They took loads of time. The tactical dives etc.
14/3/24, 2:28 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I love how these guys have no morals when it comes to Arsenal, just default defend no matter what they did
14/3/24, 2:29 am - Dave: I doubt it. Unless pep and tuchel also coincidently said nasty words to him. Haven’t heard any other managers crying about Arteta being a bully
14/3/24, 2:31 am - Pero: This is a good point
14/3/24, 2:32 am - Pero: And don't forget conceicao also got yellow during the match for acting like a pork chop
14/3/24, 2:38 am - James: This is disgusting
14/3/24, 2:51 am - Dave: Whining little bitch
14/3/24, 3:47 am - James: Appalling

14/3/24, 10:35 am - James: Dial Square FC @61409710717
14/3/24, 10:57 am - Jono: De Bruyne injured
14/3/24, 10:57 am - Gerrard: Title is Livos

14/3/24, 6:54 pm - Dave: Quadruplepool
14/3/24, 7:46 pm - James: You sure? Gordon seems to be doing well
14/3/24, 9:24 pm - Jono: They’ve pulled him out of international duty. Minor groin issue was the report

15/3/24, 1:55 am - Dave: We’re back baby
15/3/24, 1:59 am - Louie: Rashford will score a screamer then we’ll park the bus. Hopefully we learnt from the City game.
15/3/24, 2:10 am - Chris: Enjoy it. You're not used to it so drink it all in.
15/3/24, 2:12 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 this guy for real?

15/3/24, 2:26 am - Chris: 🤣   he tries. Just like arsenal I guess.
15/3/24, 2:33 am - Pero: Let's keep sculling through the quarter finals 🍺

15/3/24, 6:10 pm - Dave: Bayern are a shell of the team they were
15/3/24, 6:12 pm - Dave: Jezzy doesn’t watch games. He watches 3 minute highlights of Liverpool, then 6 hours of pitchside, then shit talks Arsenal.

16/3/24, 3:37 am - James: Go further back, they're actually from Middlesex which isn't even London
16/3/24, 3:38 am - James: It's like their Leipzig, a manufactured club 🤷

16/3/24, 1:44 pm - Dave: Strange post. Classic Liverpool propaganda when Nunez is having “the season of his life” but doesn’t feature in top 15 for assists or top 13 for goals in the league
16/3/24, 1:45 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 he's really putting in the work innit
16/3/24, 1:45 pm - Dave: “Bow down” to our very average 100m crayon eater

17/3/24, 7:05 pm - Dave: Wen quadruple? Book table jezzy
17/3/24, 7:06 pm - Dave: Commiserations @61404060785
17/3/24, 7:06 pm - Jono: That’s a killer
17/3/24, 7:06 pm - Dave: Tough way to lose it
17/3/24, 7:07 pm - Jono: Garnacho brilliant
17/3/24, 7:29 pm - Dave: https://x.com/sonamlama23/status/1769426894536019993?s=46&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
17/3/24, 8:11 pm - James: Anthony scored lol
17/3/24, 8:11 pm - James: Won't be happy
17/3/24, 8:12 pm - Dave: Beat Liverpools entire back 4 lol, was a class goal
17/3/24, 8:28 pm - ~ Dave changed this group's icon
17/3/24, 9:02 pm - Liam: Can’t be losing to united
17/3/24, 9:12 pm - Louie: What a great start to the week
17/3/24, 10:02 pm - Dave: https://x.com/now_arsenai/status/1769442330908434784?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
17/3/24, 10:05 pm - James: Realistically that's the biggest comp he was likely to win this season
17/3/24, 10:06 pm - Liam: Head has gone
17/3/24, 10:06 pm - Dave: Yup. Still got Europa to be fair
17/3/24, 10:06 pm - Dave: Can focus on that now
17/3/24, 10:07 pm - James: Yes but that isn't bigger than FA Cup
17/3/24, 10:07 pm - James: Sky have made the false narrative league position is more important. Is to then because that's their money maker
17/3/24, 10:07 pm - James: FA Cup is huge. Always was
17/3/24, 10:12 pm - Dave: Of course it isn’t
17/3/24, 10:12 pm - Dave: I’m just saying. They still have a trophy that’s realistically in reach
17/3/24, 10:16 pm - James: Ouch
17/3/24, 10:16 pm - James: Do you think Trent thinks this win means less to manure fans than beating slavia paraq does to varpool fans?
17/3/24, 10:16 pm - James: Slivian paroq
17/3/24, 10:16 pm - James: Who was it?
17/3/24, 10:17 pm - Jono: I’m annoyed that we completely dominated most of the game and somehow still lost. The 2nd half was like a training session but we couldn’t finish. They sat back and we just walked through them about 20 times
17/3/24, 10:18 pm - Jono: Maybe it’s a wake up call
17/3/24, 10:18 pm - Jono: But could also go the other way
17/3/24, 10:19 pm - Dave: https://x.com/tenhagera/status/1769442127694442822?s=46&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
17/3/24, 10:19 pm - Pero: Full of class
17/3/24, 10:19 pm - Dave: "Man City might have humiliated Man United 3-0 at Old Trafford, but our 4-3 loss means more"
17/3/24, 10:21 pm - Pero: Right on the last minute that is a killer
17/3/24, 10:23 pm - Liam: Can’t argue with that
17/3/24, 10:25 pm - James: Think he really wanted to lift the oldest comp in the world for his farewell
17/3/24, 10:25 pm - James: Heartbreaker
17/3/24, 10:25 pm - James: Can't be calling journalists fat
17/3/24, 10:26 pm - James: So should have been 4-2?
17/3/24, 10:26 pm - James: It being man utd just makes it so much worse for him
17/3/24, 10:26 pm - Pero: If antony is scoring, it must be a great day for manure
17/3/24, 10:31 pm - James: Then it being both Manchester clubs preventing winning the two big trophies makes it even worse
17/3/24, 10:32 pm - James: Imagine Leverkusen v Varpool Europa final and xabi takes that one away too
17/3/24, 10:34 pm - Gerrard: So many messages, so Liverpool lost?
17/3/24, 10:40 pm - James: Scored more goals this season now than women he's raped
17/3/24, 10:41 pm - James: They did but I'm confused. Rodwell showed evidence Varpool lost fairly and Jono reckons Varpool battered them
17/3/24, 10:42 pm - James: I didn't watch it
17/3/24, 10:45 pm - Gerrard: I'm going to assume Rodders is loving that United won a game because he has no moral backbone
17/3/24, 10:47 pm - Pero: I really hope Coventry win it
17/3/24, 10:47 pm - Gerrard: Along with that I'm assuming Rodders (an Arsenal fan) put a United player as the group chat picture also?
17/3/24, 11:42 pm - Jono: Yeah. Odd move.
17/3/24, 11:45 pm - Jono: I'm not 1 to ever suggest possession stats should count for something but in our case we had about 3 or 4 openings from our ball movement and pressing that led to outnumbering their defensive line as they were completely cooked. 2nd half in particular. 1st half United looked better in the first 30 minutes and had some decent chances which probably led to the xG numbers
17/3/24, 11:46 pm - Jono: I got to the point i was just waiting for our next goal rather than hoping for it
17/3/24, 11:51 pm - Gerrard: Worst thing about today, it went to extra.
Best thing about today, we get to see City pump United in a final again.
18/3/24, 12:04 am - Dave: Why are you making it about me mate? Rent free
18/3/24, 12:19 am - Gerrard: It's all about you Rodders
18/3/24, 12:19 am - Gerrard: This will be useful later for Arsenal, thank you
18/3/24, 12:35 am - Dave: Going to start spitting on children again
18/3/24, 12:36 am - Dave: Beat me to it 😂😂
18/3/24, 12:42 am - Gerrard: The level of Liverpool in your head is immense
18/3/24, 1:29 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 more messages from you over a United victory than all my United friends combined.
18/3/24, 1:29 am - Gerrard: You should be looking in that mirror at yourself.
18/3/24, 1:30 am - Louie: I’m currently at work, wait till after 5pm 🤣
18/3/24, 1:30 am - Gerrard: Only one message from Jono, nothing from Adem
18/3/24, 1:30 am - Dave: Welcome to my world as an Arsenal fan on the receiving end of it from you
18/3/24, 1:31 am - Dave: It’s like this every day for us jezzy
18/3/24, 1:31 am - Gerrard: I wouldn't celebrate a United victory, would you guys @61404060785 @61452662705 ?
18/3/24, 1:31 am - Dave: You read any of James messages today?
18/3/24, 1:31 am - Gerrard: *that picture you keep posting about making it about you
18/3/24, 1:32 am - Gerrard: I only interact with Jimmity in real life, he's a gentleman
18/3/24, 1:33 am - Dave: Brown nose
18/3/24, 1:33 am - Gerrard: *to me, not others
18/3/24, 1:33 am - James: True
18/3/24, 1:36 am - Gerrard: Just saw the highlights, this should keep ETH in the job and keep United out of the top 4.
So take the positives.
18/3/24, 1:37 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 your boy gave them the 3rd goal?
18/3/24, 1:45 am - Jono: Had played well for the most part but now i see why Klopp rarely plays him 90 minutes
18/3/24, 1:45 am - Jono: He's cooked after 70-80
18/3/24, 1:45 am - James: Just saw the highlights
18/3/24, 1:46 am - James: Jez your defence didn't want to show up today?
18/3/24, 1:46 am - James: Who gave the ball away in mid for the third
18/3/24, 1:46 am - Jono: Darwin
18/3/24, 1:47 am - Jono: Came back to help protect the lead but was a liability instead <This message was edited>
18/3/24, 1:48 am - Jono: Players were fatigued by ET. Its on Klopp for going full strength in a dead tie on Thursday
18/3/24, 1:48 am - Jono: Gapko copping a lot of shit
18/3/24, 1:48 am - Jono: He was terrible when he came on
18/3/24, 1:59 am - Gerrard: Can't blame em for having an off day, the kids are doing well
18/3/24, 2:03 am - Dave: Game would have been over in 90 if rashford was capable of hitting a barn door
18/3/24, 2:04 am - Dave: Hope Gordon starts over him
18/3/24, 2:05 am - Gerrard: Who's an arsekisser now?
18/3/24, 2:20 am - Dave: Facts only. He’s a better player. And he’s got that dog in him. Think he’s class

18/3/24, 4:55 am - James: Terrible attitude from Robinson he was laughing
18/3/24, 4:56 am - Jono: Are we gonna ignore Pep calling out Eddie’s tactics during the handshake?
18/3/24, 4:56 am - Jono: I was happy to as Newtle are irrelevant

18/3/24, 6:17 am - Gerrard: Only letting @61452662705 be Irish is he sits down with me and watches;
The Wind That Shakes The Barley 
In The Name of The Father
Bloody Sunday
The Commitments
18/3/24, 6:19 am - James: I'll stand and watch them
18/3/24, 6:21 am - Dave: Going straight for the heavy hitters
18/3/24, 6:54 am - James: I saw this. I might go for a piss up in Melbourne
18/3/24, 6:54 am - James: No idea what this is all about or why

18/3/24, 7:56 am - Gerrard: No idea, check google
18/3/24, 12:06 pm - Pero: On other news did you see Stirling being booed by chelsea fans during the game because how garbage he was playing 😂😂
18/3/24, 12:07 pm - Gerrard: Ouch
18/3/24, 12:07 pm - Gerrard: Shit pen though
18/3/24, 12:07 pm - Pero: See his free kick aswell ? It was worse then the pen
18/3/24, 12:08 pm - Pero: Even Leicester players were patting him on the head showing sympathy

18/3/24, 10:52 pm - James: How's Melbourne got a 105k seater stadium
18/3/24, 10:52 pm - James: Who plays there
18/3/24, 10:52 pm - James: If we all go to watch the Varsenal game that probably means we've seen them live more times than rods and liams
18/3/24, 10:56 pm - Dave: Alright Billy. You’ve seen Newcastle once in the 8 years that I’ve known you. And Jezzy can’t even get out of bed to watch Liverpool 👀
18/3/24, 10:59 pm - Gerrard: AFL and cricket innit
18/3/24, 10:59 pm - Gerrard: Without a doubt
18/3/24, 10:59 pm - Gerrard: But I haven't seen more Bournemouth games than him
@61452662705
18/3/24, 10:59 pm - James: Shall I post the Varsenal ones @14244893404?
18/3/24, 11:00 pm - Dave: We all know you buy programs on eBay
18/3/24, 11:00 pm - James: Think one of them was Varsenal actually
18/3/24, 11:00 pm - James: @61409710717 casual?
18/3/24, 11:03 pm - Dave: I’ve seen arsenal more times in the past 2 years than you’ve seen Newcastle in a decade 🤷‍♂️
18/3/24, 11:11 pm - Gerrard: Well;
1. He's American.
2. He ditched his boyhood club to follow the currently winning team at the top.
3. He celebrates "his" team's bitter rivals winning.
4. He changes his opinions as soon as he hears different on the football media.
5. He thinks Arteta is a legit manager.
6. His takes on everything are based off football twitter.
7. He makes Jono look sane.
8. He doesn't go to football matches.

Enough for a casual verdict?
18/3/24, 11:16 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 
9. He keeps claiming "he got us" over nothing
18/3/24, 11:22 pm - James: In friendlies?
18/3/24, 11:22 pm - James: 🫣
18/3/24, 11:37 pm - Jono: Maybe it’s you who’s insane?

21/3/24, 1:32 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 you been such a new man in here this year but @14244893404 picked up the torch of toxicity biased rhetoric
21/3/24, 1:40 am - Dave: If you can refrain from sending arsenal memes or shit talking for one day, peace will be restored. We can then go back to laughing at United and Chelsea. Sorry @61413646755
21/3/24, 1:43 am - Gerrard: All my posts are funny memes someone else created, you just shit on Liverpool and Klopp for being Liverpool and Klopp.
I don't think it's the same.

24/3/24, 12:29 am - Dave: The trust fund kids decided to start a podcast. Didn’t know toffs watch footy
24/3/24, 12:39 am - Gerrard: You got something against everyone innit
24/3/24, 12:45 am - Dave: Ah come on mate, don’t start again
24/3/24, 12:46 am - Gerrard: Just saying, always negative energy bro
24/3/24, 12:46 am - Dave: You’ve been doing so well
24/3/24, 12:46 am - Gerrard: Literally haven't made any adjustments.
It's all in you bro.
24/3/24, 11:55 pm - Gerrard: Still my favourite years of football

The end lol
25/3/24, 11:46 am - Gerrard: An amazing Chelsea player
25/3/24, 8:07 pm - James: Gerrard shouldn't be in there
25/3/24, 8:08 pm - James: He's the only one with no premier league records or achievements
25/3/24, 8:08 pm - James: Ian Wright as well
25/3/24, 8:28 pm - Dave: Ian Wright won a premier league title and scored 185 goals in 288 appearances for Arsenal. He’s absolutely qualified to be in there
25/3/24, 8:29 pm - James: Scott Carson won a title?
25/3/24, 8:29 pm - Dave: Gerrard, kind of agree with as he didn’t win a league title. Strange to have a “premier league hall of fame inductee” that never actually won the prem
25/3/24, 8:30 pm - Dave: Good troll
25/3/24, 8:30 pm - James: Matt Le Tissier should be in there
25/3/24, 8:30 pm - James: Gerrard shouldn't
25/3/24, 8:30 pm - Dave: If gerrard is, absolutely
25/3/24, 8:30 pm - James: Henderson over gerrard
25/3/24, 8:30 pm - Dave: Matt Le tissier was one of the best players to grace the league, so underrated
25/3/24, 8:30 pm - Dave: Technically brilliant
25/3/24, 8:31 pm - James: Nobody likes him though because he said covid was bullshit
25/3/24, 8:31 pm - James: Vax was bullshit rather
25/3/24, 8:31 pm - James: He's cancelled
25/3/24, 8:31 pm - Dave: I mean.. I wouldn’t put Henderson in there but I can see the logic why you’d have him over gerrard
25/3/24, 8:32 pm - Dave: Only Liverpool player that should be in there imo is Salah. Sure he’ll get inducted at some point
25/3/24, 8:33 pm - Dave: That’s actually wild. Just went through that list again. Literally the only one
25/3/24, 11:53 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/wa5v5CWyJzE?si=XYmceGKjng7Z0ElH
26/3/24, 12:58 am - Gerrard: Has anyone noticed that Ashley Cole rates winning the CL with Chelsea over the "invincible" season at Arsenal?
26/3/24, 4:31 am - Dave: Ashley Cole: "I’m honoured to join the Premier League Hall of Fame. It’s humbling and fulfilling to be rewarded at the end of your career."

"Being a boyhood Arsenal fan, I was living out a dream just pulling on the shirt and playing for the first team. Playing in front of amazing fans so close to the pitch at Highbury, so intimate and for me one of the most beautiful stadiums."

"Winning my first Premier League title was certainly special. To lift that trophy in front of my friends and family and celebrate with your teammates after a gruelling 38-game season is amazing. That feeling is hard to explain. Growing up, all I knew was loving Arsenal Football Club."
26/3/24, 4:32 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 does Rodders just put " " around his own words and claim facts?
26/3/24, 4:33 am - Gerrard: I prefer Cole saying "That's why I left" after winning the CL
26/3/24, 4:34 am - Dave: Copy and paste from Cole’s mouth. Once a gunner, always a gunner
26/3/24, 4:36 am - Dave: We also copy and paste legends of the game. Hence why 30% of the hall of fame are Arsenal 🔴⚪️ <This message was edited>
26/3/24, 4:37 am - Gerrard: I'm sensing that you feel very sensitive about this topic so I'll let you be
26/3/24, 4:39 am - Dave: 36% actually. Cut ourselves short there
26/3/24, 4:48 am - James: That's why I left for Chelsea?
26/3/24, 4:48 am - James: That's why I rejected the contract and went to our rivals?
26/3/24, 4:48 am - James: And won more trophies
26/3/24, 4:48 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I don't know what's true anymore
26/3/24, 4:50 am - James: Surely no Varsenal fans like cashley cole
26/3/24, 4:50 am - James: Remember all the fake money with his face on it?
26/3/24, 4:51 am - James: Because he wanted to join a bigger club and win things?
26/3/24, 4:51 am - Gerrard: I reckon it could've also been playing for a better manager too
26/3/24, 4:51 am - James: Did Wenger ever beat jose
26/3/24, 4:52 am - James: Jose hated wengy
26/3/24, 4:52 am - Gerrard: Jose won more in a shorter time, much shorter
26/3/24, 4:52 am - James: I just remember varsy getting smeshed by them each season
26/3/24, 4:53 am - Gerrard: I thought it's misleading to compare Wenger and Fergie.
Should be Rafa and Wenger.
26/3/24, 4:54 am - Dave: 4 titles vs 3 titles over 8 years. That’s a proper rivalry
26/3/24, 4:54 am - Dave: Not klopp taking Pep’s cock up his arse for 9 years
26/3/24, 4:54 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 gone off topic again
26/3/24, 4:58 am - James: I'm just saying what I remember here
26/3/24, 4:58 am - James: I have no dog in the race
26/3/24, 4:58 am - James: How can any varsey fan like cashley
26/3/24, 4:58 am - Dave: Best left back that ever graced the prem, built by Arsenal and part of
Invincibles. Hard to hate forever
26/3/24, 4:58 am - Dave: Won trophies for us
26/3/24, 4:59 am - Dave: Did his part 🤷‍♂️
26/3/24, 4:59 am - Gerrard: Me neither
26/3/24, 4:59 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 no backbone with these fans
26/3/24, 5:01 am - Dave: Didn’t you stand in solidarity with a racist? Worst fans in the league
26/3/24, 5:01 am - James: Holy shit
26/3/24, 5:02 am - Gerrard: You keep bringing up an allegation like it's a thing
26/3/24, 5:05 am - Gerrard: Suarez wasn't proven racist and didn't say anything racist to me.
Cole left you and betrayed you.
RVP the same.
Xhaka flipped you off and threw the armband.
🤷🏼‍♂️ feels like these fans would forgive someone taking a steaming shite on the Arsenal jersey if they could then get a win out of them 🤷🏼‍♂️
26/3/24, 5:05 am - Gerrard: No backbone
26/3/24, 5:05 am - Dave: Golden boy Suarez about as innocent as OJ laddy
26/3/24, 5:46 am - Gerrard: You're using the Suarez play on the wrong Livo fan
26/3/24, 10:22 am - James: He's done a Hoddle 😲
26/3/24, 10:23 am - James: Hopefully the rainbow people go nuts on twitter and he gets sacked before the euros
26/3/24, 10:23 am - James: 🤞
26/3/24, 10:34 am - Gerrard: Lol
26/3/24, 10:34 am - Gerrard: He's angling for the United job
26/3/24, 10:35 am - Gerrard: Bigots, rapists and women beaters
26/3/24, 10:35 am - James: You remember why Hoddle got sacked?
26/3/24, 10:35 am - James: Fits in
26/3/24, 10:35 am - Gerrard: Nah didn't care about England before you came along
26/3/24, 10:36 am - James: I was going to share but if you're going to be like that then good night and good luck
26/3/24, 10:36 am - Gerrard: Whoa, I'm being honest
26/3/24, 10:37 am - James: Don't
26/3/24, 10:37 am - James: Look where that's got you so far
26/3/24, 10:37 am - Gerrard: I'm saying that I didn't have a reason to gather dirt on England before you guys
26/3/24, 11:42 am - Gerrard: It was a different time....
26/3/24, 2:25 pm - Dave: Holy shit
26/3/24, 2:38 pm - Dave: I mean.. Henry scored 10 against Chelsea, 9 against United and 9 against Liverpool. Whoever made that is reaching for a narrative lol.

Both legends of the premier league. Henry a more technically and naturally gifted player in my eyes. Think Salah will be remembered as one of the prem greats in years to come, don’t feel like he gets the respect he deserves at the moment
27/3/24, 12:05 am - Gerrard: Not like Arsenal 🤣
27/3/24, 12:44 am - Jono: Tarkowski lol
27/3/24, 12:44 am - Jono: How’s Jota not there
27/3/24, 12:45 am - Gerrard: Wouldn't put Saka in eh
27/3/24, 12:45 am - Gerrard: English hype
27/3/24, 12:45 am - Jono: Agree with the rest though. Conor had a shocker against Mancs last start so hopefully not a sign of things to come
27/3/24, 12:45 am - Dave: Odd scouse accent hey @61452662705 https://www.instagram.com/reel/C42zevXsCsM/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
27/3/24, 12:45 am - Gerrard: No one opens these
27/3/24, 12:46 am - Dave: Know how it feels? 😂😂
27/3/24, 12:46 am - Jono: Robbo injured again @61409710717
27/3/24, 12:47 am - Gerrard: Who cares
27/3/24, 12:47 am - Dave: Walker and stones injured as well
27/3/24, 10:18 am - James: Can just replace with zabaleta and kompany though 🥲
27/3/24, 12:03 pm - Jono: I’ve never seen a race for a manager where no wants said manager like there is for Gareth
27/3/24, 7:10 pm - Dave: Completed it mate. Doesn’t give a shit anymore 😂
27/3/24, 7:13 pm - Dave: Imagine how devastated you’d be if you found out that wet wank was your new manager. He’s the odds on favourite for ETH replacement at United
27/3/24, 10:04 pm - James: What a great story though
27/3/24, 10:20 pm - Dave: Arsenal and Liverpool are like Man Citehs little brothers just looking for a nod of approval 🤣
28/3/24, 4:37 pm - Jono: @61452662705 you gotta know when to hold them em…

29/3/24, 1:09 am - Pero: How come endo is so far down the list?
29/3/24, 1:10 am - Gerrard: Racism
29/3/24, 1:10 am - Gerrard: The yellow threat
29/3/24, 1:14 am - Pero: Who's doing these rankings ?
29/3/24, 1:14 am - Gerrard: Espn
29/3/24, 1:14 am - Gerrard: (cunts)
29/3/24, 1:18 am - Pero: Yeh i thought endo was the new upcoming messiah, they must be big pack of racists
29/3/24, 1:22 am - Gerrard: Yeah and having Havertz so low is insanity
29/3/24, 1:29 am - Pero: Indeed, it is difficult to order arsenals top 8
29/3/24, 1:36 am - James: All before he was charged. Nothing to see here. He's served his time free tonali
29/3/24, 1:36 am - James: Let players bet on their team winning
29/3/24, 1:36 am - James: Creates better banter between players and will make them try harder <This message was edited>
29/3/24, 1:40 am - Gerrard: Wild
29/3/24, 1:44 am - James: Maybe that's why it was better in the late 90s and 2000s
29/3/24, 1:45 am - Gerrard: All degens back then
29/3/24, 1:45 am - James: Pissed up
29/3/24, 1:45 am - Gerrard: Cheating
29/3/24, 1:46 am - Gerrard: Racists
29/3/24, 1:46 am - Gerrard: Everyone's too nice now
29/3/24, 1:46 am - James: Now you got players like Rice who have never had a beer
29/3/24, 1:46 am - Gerrard: Hugging after games
29/3/24, 1:46 am - James: Gay
29/3/24, 1:46 am - Gerrard: Taken a few cocks though
29/3/24, 4:12 am - Dave: Racist

30/3/24, 2:33 am - Gerrard: Giggs was shit anyway
30/3/24, 2:34 am - Gerrard: Love how they keep trying each week to make their team look better than they are
30/3/24, 3:12 am - James: https://youtu.be/l4JrjhV-Bp4?feature=shared
30/3/24, 3:23 am - Dave: Should add a picture of Rhodri’s wife to that trophy list while he’s there
30/3/24, 3:26 am - Dave: Thought it had been pulled from the shelves 😂
30/3/24, 3:26 am - Gerrard: Gonna go drink it on the curb <This message was edited>
30/3/24, 3:32 am - James: Who ya going to glass later tonight?
30/3/24, 3:33 am - Gerrard: Gonna firebomb the cop shop <This message was edited>
30/3/24, 3:35 am - James: Better than Saka though
30/3/24, 3:35 am - Gerrard: No doubt
30/3/24, 3:36 am - Gerrard: Saka may end up as good as Sterling
30/3/24, 3:36 am - Gerrard: If he goes to a legit team
30/3/24, 3:37 am - James: Or Shawn Wright Phillips
30/3/24, 3:38 am - Gerrard: What ever happened to Grealish?
30/3/24, 3:48 am - Dave: 🧂🧂🧂

31/3/24, 12:43 am - Dave: 10-0 Arsenal
31/3/24, 12:45 am - Liam: Could happen 😂
31/3/24, 12:56 am - Gerrard: 🤨
31/3/24, 12:56 am - Gerrard: That's why he has issues with the black players
31/3/24, 1:47 am - Liam: Debated it, I can stay up that late lol. Liverpool game is possible, arsenal game is too late
31/3/24, 1:52 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5Cq8sHI5Gm/?igsh=MW40M2phZTkzY3JncA==

31/3/24, 12:05 pm - Jono: It’s like they gotta work tomorrow
31/3/24, 12:05 pm - James: I don't know mate, all I know is that I definitely won't be there with them. At 6am.
31/3/24, 12:08 pm - James: @61409710717 you don't think you can stay up for the Varpool game?
31/3/24, 12:13 pm - Gerrard: Maybe
31/3/24, 12:13 pm - Gerrard: See how I feel
31/3/24, 12:16 pm - James: Just might be better to watch you guys win and have a nice rest in the morning instead of getting up early to watch citeh pump varsey
31/3/24, 12:17 pm - James: Or, that would perhaps make your day even better 🤔
31/3/24, 12:26 pm - Gerrard: Need to get into the up at 6am routine, new role innit

31/3/24, 8:01 pm - Dave: There you go. Point at the Etihad is a good result for us and even better for you. 

Think Liverpool will win the league now, they have to be the favourites. Easiest fixtures remaining and only Europa to worry about.
31/3/24, 11:57 pm - Liam: Great result, no complaints
31/3/24, 11:58 pm - Jono: Glad I fell asleep for that ‘blockbuster’ game

1/4/24, 12:26 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5MVki-IbP5/?igsh=MXF2azBtb2RvNmRyMQ==
At least one Arsenal team wins trophies
1/4/24, 12:33 am - Gerrard: Saka showed up less that Haaland
1/4/24, 12:50 am - James: Thank God I had a lovely long lay in and opted to watch the three min 'highlights' instead.
1/4/24, 12:50 am - James: What an utterly shit game of football that was
1/4/24, 12:50 am - Gerrard: Poor, we had a great morning.
Seeing Liam lose his mind as the sun came up, beautiful.
1/4/24, 12:51 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/Fr8sP6zw4Ao?si=uww0Ms8NnHqmDB83
1/4/24, 1:09 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/huVANtowKy0?si=CkCqN1Kc9KevDO-e
1/4/24, 1:51 am - James: Just saw citeh had 72% possession. Cryteta park the bus?
1/4/24, 1:53 am - Gerrard: I don't think they had the choice, City dommed
1/4/24, 1:54 am - Jono: I honestly thought with all this momentum they’ve had they were gonna go for it
1/4/24, 1:54 am - Gerrard: It was like Livo vs Brighton but Brighton had some counters and Livo won the game.
1/4/24, 1:54 am - Jono: Odegaard had a stinker by the looks of it
1/4/24, 1:55 am - Gerrard: All did
1/4/24, 1:55 am - Gerrard: Saka not existent
1/4/24, 1:56 am - James: Standard
1/4/24, 1:56 am - James: Why he shouldn't go to the euros
1/4/24, 1:56 am - Gerrard: See everyone has bad days innit, I said that after Livo's loss in the cup.
1/4/24, 1:56 am - James: All well and good scoring the fourth goal in a 6-0 win against a team ranked 108th in the world
1/4/24, 1:56 am - James: We need big game players
1/4/24, 1:56 am - Gerrard: Maybe the AFTV fans will listen now.
1/4/24, 1:57 am - Gerrard: Harvey, innit
1/4/24, 1:57 am - James: Looked like a terrible game
1/4/24, 1:58 am - Gerrard: Liam's reactions were fun
1/4/24, 1:59 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/w-pzX2q0OMU?si=nzF_7hqSp9Xph4FC
Should redo these now
1/4/24, 3:47 am - James: Barnes
1/4/24, 3:47 am - Gerrard: Negative
1/4/24, 3:48 am - James: Barnes is better than ellot
1/4/24, 3:48 am - James: Missed him this season 😢
1/4/24, 3:49 am - Gerrard: Who's Barnes?
1/4/24, 3:49 am - Gerrard: John?
1/4/24, 3:49 am - James: You have a gun?
1/4/24, 3:50 am - James: Air rifle?
1/4/24, 3:50 am - Gerrard: 🤨
1/4/24, 3:50 am - James: Do you have an air rifle
1/4/24, 3:51 am - James: Got a rat to shoot
1/4/24, 3:51 am - Gerrard: 🤨
1/4/24, 3:51 am - Gerrard: 🤨
1/4/24, 3:53 am - James: You need a license to buy a BB gun here 😂
1/4/24, 3:53 am - Gerrard: Ja
1/4/24, 3:54 am - Gerrard: Put on the City v Arsenal game, it'll fall asleep
1/4/24, 3:54 am - James: Might kill itself
1/4/24, 4:01 am - Jono: The only action was the fake fight between Haaland and Gabriel
1/4/24, 4:01 am - Jono: at the end of the game
1/4/24, 4:08 am - Dave: Strange comment. We took 8 points off citeh and Liverpool combined these season. Etihad and Anfield two most difficult stadiums to go to in the country and we didn’t drop points
1/4/24, 4:08 am - Dave: Very happy with a point today
1/4/24, 4:08 am - Dave: Arteta masterclass. Could have won it, had more chances than citeh
1/4/24, 4:13 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 I think may have watched a retro game instead of today's game
1/4/24, 4:52 am - Liam: Arteta outclassed pep and klopp this season
1/4/24, 5:10 am - Liam: Outclassed
1/4/24, 5:25 am - Dave: No answers
1/4/24, 5:25 am - Dave: Outclassed
1/4/24, 5:32 am - Dave: Actually wild how Pop and Klepp both got found out by Arteta. Citeh and Liverpool used to dick Arsenal during the squad rebuild. 

Now we’ve rebuilt, untouchable. Liverpool haven’t beaten Arsenal in the league for over 2 YEARS and City haven’t beaten us the last 3 times we played them 💪👊🔴⚪️
1/4/24, 6:40 am - James: From when
1/4/24, 6:41 am - Gerrard: The memories of AFTV fans
1/4/24, 6:50 am - Liam: Our run in doesn’t look to bad now. Lots of home games
1/4/24, 6:50 am - Liam: Liverpool got a shed load of away games and they are out of form
1/4/24, 6:56 am - Dave: It’s Liverpools to lose
1/4/24, 6:56 am - Dave: Total bottle jobs if they don’t win premier league and Europa
1/4/24, 6:57 am - Dave: Especially on Klopp’s fair well tour with all the VAR decisions
1/4/24, 7:22 am - James: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5MPHPLAF1O/?igsh=MWprdTg2OHQwaXE5dg==
1/4/24, 7:24 am - Gerrard: Celebrating a draw is a bad look unless you needed one point to win the league on the last day
1/4/24, 7:59 am - Dave: Who celebrated?
1/4/24, 8:02 am - Gerrard: Liam and AFTV
1/4/24, 8:02 am - Gerrard: So you
1/4/24, 8:44 am - Liam: That point might win us the league
1/4/24, 8:45 am - Liam: Without Mikel taking 5 points off city, Liverpool wouldn’t be top
1/4/24, 8:48 am - Gerrard: Then the refs innit
1/4/24, 8:54 am - Liam: All evens itself out over the season. Not really worth mentioning
1/4/24, 9:10 am - Pero: Defensive brilliance by arteta , raya hardly touched the ball. Arsenal with more shots on target and better chances. Arteta masterclass once again
1/4/24, 9:10 am - Pero: Never seen a better defensive performance very impressive
1/4/24, 9:22 am - Gerrard: City were terrible
1/4/24, 9:41 am - James: That's what all the neutrals are saying
1/4/24, 9:41 am - James: Artey brought the team bus
1/4/24, 9:41 am - Pero: City couldn't do much cause defensively the setup was very good
1/4/24, 10:23 am - James: Keane saying Haaland is League 2 level
1/4/24, 10:23 am - Gerrard: Love it
1/4/24, 10:23 am - James: Done his dad and now him
1/4/24, 10:26 am - James: Who's winning the league? 😵
1/4/24, 10:26 am - Gerrard: The best team
1/4/24, 11:30 am - Liam: What are your thoughts?
1/4/24, 11:31 am - James: Varpool have to win
1/4/24, 11:31 am - James: Look at their fixtures
1/4/24, 11:33 am - Liam: A lot of a away games
1/4/24, 11:34 am - James: Have they got the minerals?
1/4/24, 11:35 am - Liam: Don’t think so.
1/4/24, 11:35 am - Liam: Klopps too tired
1/4/24, 11:37 am - Gerrard: There are no away games with Klopp
1/4/24, 11:41 am - Liam: Klopps 😴 why he’s quitting
1/4/24, 11:42 am - James: Klupp has had enough of the early kick offs he wants to stay in bed
1/4/24, 11:43 am - James: If any of your teams win though I consider it the worst ever premier league season with the weakest champions not including Leicester
1/4/24, 11:43 am - James: Even if citeh win, they've been pretty meh
1/4/24, 12:13 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 you think we care what you think?
1/4/24, 12:14 pm - James: Yeah Liam asked me
1/4/24, 12:15 pm - Jono: We’ve only lost 2 all season thus far lol
1/4/24, 12:16 pm - Liam: I just wanted you to feel included and relevant
1/4/24, 12:25 pm - James: Yeah just mean this season has been a bit meh. Older seasons where Varpool and Citeh were miles ahead was a real showcase of quality. Having Varsenal on the same points just devalues it all
1/4/24, 12:25 pm - Gerrard: Newsflash he doesn't care
1/4/24, 12:26 pm - Gerrard: Jimmity doesn't like more than two teams doing well
1/4/24, 12:29 pm - Gerrard: Newty not doing well = shit season
1/4/24, 1:08 pm - Jono: Ahhh VARsenal shitcanning… you may carry on sir
1/4/24, 1:09 pm - James: Yeah you got it, shame your mate is on the blob this evening
1/4/24, 1:10 pm - Jono: Nuh he can’t be on the blob, he’s got a big morning of work tomorrow innit
1/4/24, 1:49 pm - James: https://youtu.be/iHPR4UWAreo?feature=shared
1/4/24, 7:11 pm - Dave: That’s what the casuals are saying. It’s like when people used to complain about mourinho. Chelsea made teams look shit because he did whatever it took to get the result he wanted. When arteta wins some trophies, you’ll all be salivating over his genius
1/4/24, 7:15 pm - Dave: This has been the most exciting season since 2011-2012.
1/4/24, 9:48 pm - Liam: https://youtube.com/shorts/6AaAXUOu6Zw?si=as_pErkSB3t7W6Y-
1/4/24, 10:10 pm - Dave: Pocketed him last game as well. Gabriel is having a better season than saliba imo. Best CB duo in the league by a country mile 👊👊👊
1/4/24, 11:00 pm - Gerrard: A lot of talk from Arsenal fans in here after a draw
1/4/24, 11:17 pm - Liam: Title winning form
1/4/24, 11:17 pm - Gerrard: 8 is a streak now?
1/4/24, 11:17 pm - Liam: On track for the double?
1/4/24, 11:17 pm - Dave: Oh god 🤤
1/4/24, 11:18 pm - Dave: How your streak going?
1/4/24, 11:18 pm - Dave: Didn’t rat face just ruin your quadruple dreams?
1/4/24, 11:19 pm - Gerrard: The mediocrity is astounding with AFTV fans
1/4/24, 11:19 pm - Gerrard: You guys have been hurt for so long that you'll take anything close to good
1/4/24, 11:20 pm - Liam: Can’t be losing against united
1/4/24, 11:21 pm - Liam: Pathetic
1/4/24, 11:26 pm - Gerrard: Astounding
1/4/24, 11:57 pm - Pero: Did he get man of the match ? Played brilliantly
2/4/24, 12:40 am - Dave: Best part is, they have play them at old Trafford in league. Imagine if fidget spinner sinks their title hopes 👀
2/4/24, 12:41 am - Dave: Think it was saliba actually. Either one of them will do. Best defence in league 👊👊 both rock solid
2/4/24, 12:49 am - Gerrard: The we didn't lose awards
2/4/24, 12:51 am - Dave: https://youtu.be/-8skE-MgzL8?si=rWle3ILR4AFECCu_
2/4/24, 12:51 am - Liam: Great analysis
2/4/24, 12:51 am - Dave: We have the next Pep at the helm ❤️❤️❤️
2/4/24, 1:16 am - Gerrard: Broke them for a draw 🎉
2/4/24, 1:44 am - Dave: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4xQZ_EAAve/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
2/4/24, 1:56 am - James: Woah
2/4/24, 2:04 am - Dave: Outrageous isn’t it. I don’t agree, I think they’ve got a great bunch of youngsters coming through and Amorim will lead them to the treble next year
2/4/24, 2:06 am - James: Almiron?
2/4/24, 2:46 am - Gerrard: The frog man?
2/4/24, 2:48 am - Gerrard: Poty
2/4/24, 3:11 am - James: Sheeeeeet
2/4/24, 3:11 am - James: Who
2/4/24, 3:11 am - Gerrard: Your right winger, frogman
2/4/24, 3:48 am - James: Scouting team 'unearthed' so much talent. Mane, Salah, Alisson, Van Dyke, Gini. Pennies
2/4/24, 3:48 am - James: He's shit you can have him. Would be a good manager for you
2/4/24, 3:49 am - Gerrard: #loyalty
2/4/24, 3:50 am - James: Been very loyal
2/4/24, 3:54 am - Gerrard: Haven't murdered him yet
2/4/24, 4:17 am - James: https://youtu.be/RY4d0Wr4ok4?feature=shared
2/4/24, 4:17 am - James: https://youtu.be/Fr8sP6zw4Ao?feature=shared
2/4/24, 5:00 am - Dave: I’d never heard of any of those players prior to Liverpool buying them. They must have got them for next to nothing. So inspiring and incredible ❤️
2/4/24, 5:00 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 he's upset about the double delusional fans video post
2/4/24, 5:13 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5MhZAFt-Qh/?igsh=MXF0dWVyb2I5NXI0YQ==
😬
2/4/24, 6:25 am - Dave: Has Klapp beaten a top 4 side this season?
2/4/24, 6:25 am - Dave: Brrrrr
2/4/24, 6:26 am - Jono: Haven't needed to evidently
2/4/24, 6:28 am - Dave: Spurs villa and United to go
2/4/24, 6:28 am - Dave: Need to win every game
2/4/24, 6:28 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 imagine how bad you'd feel if we won the league without beating a Top 4 team..... Shame
2/4/24, 6:36 am - Gerrard: Arsenal fans need to stop.
We talk about this every season, just wait til the end, don't go getting big headed and then end up crying again - this is a toxic relationship.
2/4/24, 6:50 am - Dave: Only fanbase I’ve heard saying they’re winning the title this year are Liverpool fans. Including you 👀
2/4/24, 6:51 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 why is your mate talking to me?
2/4/24, 6:52 am - Dave: Just miss you
2/4/24, 6:52 am - Gerrard: Have we met?
2/4/24, 6:55 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 real growth
2/4/24, 6:58 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5NsF2hN6oS/?igsh=MW5xM3B0NTM5a3g5eg==
Thought I'd send this to you guys because you didn't see a goal being scored this last weekend
2/4/24, 6:59 am - Gerrard: Those are some fugly looking motherfuckerd
2/4/24, 11:50 am - James: Wow you were 8th
2/4/24, 11:50 am - James: Sames
2/4/24, 11:57 am - Jono: https://x.com/skysportsnews/status/1775096977237188865?s=48
2/4/24, 11:57 am - Jono: Rammy looking to warm a new bench
2/4/24, 11:58 am - Gerrard: Get him in, Howie wouldn't betray him
2/4/24, 12:00 pm - Liam: Would improve Newty
2/4/24, 12:01 pm - Chris: See,  there's hope for you yet
2/4/24, 12:02 pm - Jono: Arsenal have the easiest draw imo
2/4/24, 12:03 pm - Gerrard: Then why are their odds so low?
2/4/24, 12:03 pm - James: Yeah and somehow manure are 6th. Still hope
2/4/24, 12:03 pm - James: Because they'll bottle
2/4/24, 12:03 pm - James: Manure have a GD of 0
2/4/24, 12:04 pm - James: Can't explain how they're where they are
2/4/24, 12:04 pm - James: I saw expected points table they  were 12th lol
2/4/24, 12:05 pm - Jono: Yanited have arsed their way to 6th
2/4/24, 12:06 pm - Jono: They should feel lucky
2/4/24, 12:06 pm - Jono: Their fans for the first 12 weeks of the comp said it was a conspiracy
2/4/24, 12:06 pm - James: My manure friend brought up the GD thing and said that is more of a reflection on where teams should be
2/4/24, 12:07 pm - James: He isn't deluded which is nice
2/4/24, 12:07 pm - Jono: All the dodgy calls against them
2/4/24, 12:07 pm - Jono: I was adamant they were rubbish
2/4/24, 12:07 pm - Jono: Glad I was right
2/4/24, 12:07 pm - Jono: Even if they beat us in the cup
2/4/24, 12:07 pm - Jono: That was just a fucking choke on our behalf
2/4/24, 12:09 pm - James: Hopefully we can get past Everton 5 - 4 tomorrow and Manure drop points to chelki
2/4/24, 12:10 pm - James: Looks like 5th is all but CL confirmed
2/4/24, 12:10 pm - James: Top 8 will likely all get Europe. Insane that
2/4/24, 12:10 pm - Gerrard: Geez get a room you two
2/4/24, 12:11 pm - James: Threesome
2/4/24, 12:11 pm - James: Join in
2/4/24, 12:11 pm - James: Stop dogging ya weirdo
2/4/24, 12:11 pm - Gerrard: I'll just watch....
2/4/24, 12:12 pm - James: Remember when Jose called arsene a voyeur
2/4/24, 12:12 pm - Gerrard: Lol yeah
2/4/24, 12:19 pm - Jono: If it was reverse
2/4/24, 1:57 pm - Gerrard: Sooooooo Arsenal are worse?
2/4/24, 1:58 pm - Gerrard: I don't get it
2/4/24, 1:58 pm - Gerrard: They have Rice now
2/4/24, 1:58 pm - Jono: Interesting 🧐
2/4/24, 5:05 pm - Dave: https://x.com/arsenalbuzzcom/status/1774887137676022142?s=46&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
2/4/24, 5:08 pm - Dave: League is just back to normal this year so points are expected to be spread out a bit more between the elite clubs. 

Last year was a bit of an anomaly with the big clubs dropping off. Hence order being restored this year with the likes of Newty and Brighton back to where they belong
2/4/24, 10:27 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/Zs2o50gZCK4?si=vVMPqmNLuu45BfGI
2/4/24, 10:39 pm - Jono: @61452662705 that defender of yours that thought Ashley Young would be even remotely a threat in the box should be shot before he leaves StJames
2/4/24, 10:39 pm - Jono: Terrible pen to give away
2/4/24, 10:39 pm - Jono: The pen was so shit too but you’ve got Dubravka so it’s didn’t matter anyway
2/4/24, 10:44 pm - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/yA75lmQCshc?si=tRz970aoQG7xwRiV
2/4/24, 11:20 pm - James: Hasn't started a game in five years. Still at the club can't get rid
3/4/24, 12:17 am - Dave: Can’t be drawing to Everton at home
3/4/24, 2:52 am - James: https://youtu.be/EPb4kBQBH5A?feature=shared
3/4/24, 2:53 am - Gerrard: Awesome we've won it have we?
3/4/24, 2:53 am - Gerrard: Will be great to stick that up all your arses
3/4/24, 3:08 am - Dave: Better not bottle it
3/4/24, 3:15 am - Gerrard: Did you mean to say 'Better not Arsenal it'????
3/4/24, 3:15 am - Gerrard: That would make more sense
3/4/24, 3:15 am - Dave: We didn’t bottle it, we had key injuries
3/4/24, 3:16 am - Dave: You just had a captain that couldn’t stay on his feet or lead your team to 3 points in 5 games
3/4/24, 3:16 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 @61452662705 is this factually accurate???
3/4/24, 3:16 am - Dave: Levels to the bottle
3/4/24, 3:16 am - Gerrard: I remember that time Liverpool Arsenal'd it, was awful
3/4/24, 3:18 am - James: Oh fuuuck
3/4/24, 3:18 am - Gerrard: Hey @61404060785 @61452662705 RIO is saying something positive about Arsenal.....
3/4/24, 3:19 am - Gerrard: You know that 'this is what he does!' guy
3/4/24, 3:20 am - Dave: Noted. Jezzy knows better than professional footballer with 20 trophies ✅
3/4/24, 3:21 am - Gerrard: Pivot
3/4/24, 4:17 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/NIqtSgz1-o0?si=VBJt8jtQljCOKEJM
Burley says Arsenal to win it, not Arsenal it
3/4/24, 6:30 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5SQAPBs9Dw/?igsh=M290bjE3aDMxb2c5
Thank you Chelsea eh
3/4/24, 6:53 am - James: Dunno what to believe
3/4/24, 7:09 am - Gerrard: Also Arteta is shit and hasn't won anything
3/4/24, 8:16 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Newty???
Harvey Barnes supposed to be good???
Isak missing sitters then air swinging???
3/4/24, 8:20 am - Jono: Serves me right for captaining Isak
3/4/24, 8:28 am - Dave: @61452662705 ???
3/4/24, 8:32 am - James: Isak is class. 19 goals this season. Great finish. Barnes been out all season. First start in months. Won us the game at the weekend. Barnes is class
3/4/24, 8:33 am - James: 16pts?
3/4/24, 8:33 am - Gerrard: Live in the here and now brother
3/4/24, 8:34 am - James: 19 goals
3/4/24, 8:34 am - James: Barnes 4 goals
3/4/24, 8:34 am - Gerrard: Everton
3/4/24, 8:34 am - Gerrard: Sitters
3/4/24, 8:34 am - James: ⚫⚪
3/4/24, 8:34 am - Liam: Chelsea might go above Newty
3/4/24, 8:34 am - Gerrard: 🤷🏼‍♂️
3/4/24, 8:35 am - James: You gotta just trust the process
3/4/24, 8:35 am - James: Trust the prince 🇸🇦
3/4/24, 8:35 am - James: Future looks exciting

3/4/24, 8:46 am - James: It's such a banger
3/4/24, 8:46 am - Dave: They’re better than Newty. Proper manager, bigger club and smart owner that unlocked the FFP loophole. Newty’s couldn’t even figure out how to sign Tierney in the bargain basement bin
3/4/24, 8:47 am - James: Was it written by a 10 year old spaz?
3/4/24, 8:47 am - Dave: What’s yours? We ate all the pies.

3/4/24, 8:52 am - Dave: Sloppy accusations
3/4/24, 8:52 am - Gerrard: Very defensive
3/4/24, 8:55 am - James: No your face has just got fatter
3/4/24, 8:57 am - Dave: That’s pot and kettle tubby
3/4/24, 8:57 am - Gerrard: Whoa

3/4/24, 8:58 am - James: Now I do
3/4/24, 8:58 am - James: 😢
3/4/24, 8:58 am - Gerrard: There's a fat-off going on and it doesn't involve me??? Wtf
3/4/24, 8:58 am - Jono: Was 8 but doubled...
Not good enough these days. Need a player scoring 10+ and his 8 should've been 15 with all those chances
3/4/24, 8:58 am - Jono: Salah will now get a hatty after missing 47 shots on Saturday
3/4/24, 8:59 am - James: You're in the premier league, we're in Championship

3/4/24, 9:04 am - Dave: Will probably end up losing that knowing Arsenal

3/4/24, 9:04 am - Dave: Not by the police thank god
3/4/24, 9:04 am - James: Feel like they've been so unlucky
3/4/24, 9:05 am - Dave: Luton are class. Fantastically run club. I’m really rooting for them to stay up, they deserve it
3/4/24, 9:06 am - James: Hmm. It is probably one of the worst places in England
3/4/24, 9:06 am - Dave: One of those small clubs that can upset anyone on their day. Really scrappy and plucky. Barkley been an absolute machine for them
3/4/24, 9:06 am - James: Less crime than Liverpool though
3/4/24, 9:06 am - Dave: Oh the town is an absolute shit hole
3/4/24, 9:06 am - James: Liverpool?
3/4/24, 9:07 am - Dave: Was talking about Luton but same same

3/4/24, 9:09 am - Dave: Too many working class? James comes from Cambridge
3/4/24, 9:09 am - Gerrard: Yeah it shows
3/4/24, 9:12 am - James: Gez took us out west to get a fucking roll I could have got in Coogee that is better
3/4/24, 9:12 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 blasphemy
3/4/24, 9:13 am - Gerrard: Cabra rolls worse than Coogee rolls
3/4/24, 9:13 am - James: Ely. I'm inbred farm boy
3/4/24, 9:13 am - James: Carrot muncher
3/4/24, 9:13 am - Dave: What roll?

3/4/24, 9:14 am - Gerrard: Yeah, decent, I agree

3/4/24, 9:16 am - Gerrard: EXACTLY, but Cabra or Canley not Livo
3/4/24, 9:16 am - James: You wouldn't have been allowed to go
3/4/24, 9:17 am - Dave: Didn’t you shag a lady boy in Thailand?
3/4/24, 9:17 am - Gerrard: Fair play
3/4/24, 9:25 am - James: Na not yet

4/4/24, 11:28 am - Pero: Antonio is better than Nooni
4/4/24, 11:29 am - Gerrard: Isak is Ricky Lambert, when he goes to a real team he'll be found out
4/4/24, 12:09 pm - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/shorts/Li82TDFtKtg?si=E7RrxVYjQRYbMW6k

4/4/24, 8:49 pm - James: Oh yeah baby 🥲
4/4/24, 8:57 pm - Jono: Kebab break in the PL
4/4/24, 9:01 pm - Jono: Darwizzy scores when he wants
4/4/24, 9:14 pm - Dave: Man. Only 1-0 at half time, at home. What was the score at half time when you played Sheffield @61452662705 ?
4/4/24, 9:14 pm - James: 4 or 5. Away
4/4/24, 9:15 pm - Dave: Away. Wow
4/4/24, 9:15 pm - Dave: I think we were 4 up in 20 mins
4/4/24, 9:15 pm - Dave: But at home
4/4/24, 9:16 pm - Dave: Oh no I lie. It was away. 4-0 by 25th minute
4/4/24, 9:20 pm - Dave: Sheffield nearly scored 👀
4/4/24, 9:33 pm - Jono: More than happy to be top as it stands and sneaking home vs the Blades than mid table and flogging a team (which was us last year)
4/4/24, 9:52 pm - Dave: Ouch. Sheffield looking confident after that equaliser
4/4/24, 9:57 pm - Gerrard: Talking early again
4/4/24, 9:57 pm - Gerrard: Keep up the good work

4/4/24, 10:03 pm - Gerrard: You'll have to clear that with the fates
4/4/24, 10:04 pm - James: They will win. Probably 95th minute
4/4/24, 10:04 pm - James: Seen it before
4/4/24, 10:04 pm - Dave: With “2 mins added time”
4/4/24, 10:04 pm - James: Added time added to added time
4/4/24, 10:05 pm - James: Should be beating sheff like 8-0
4/4/24, 10:05 pm - Dave: Actually shocked these boys are top of the table. Sheffield are the worst club in the league by a country mile. You were right @61452662705. Leagues cooked
4/4/24, 10:05 pm - Dave: Honestly. We beat them 11-0 this season on aggregate
4/4/24, 10:05 pm - James: Will get better once PSR is scrapped
4/4/24, 10:06 pm - James: Let the rich owners spend

4/4/24, 10:13 pm - James: Claws are out
4/4/24, 10:14 pm - James: Did klosp run down the touchline celebrating?

4/4/24, 10:26 pm - James: I lie, I captained Salah. Awesome
4/4/24, 10:36 pm - Gerrard: I'd like to acknowledge all of @14244893404 hard work over all of Klopp's years at Liverpool, the talking early against West Ham and Aston Villa in the title winning season in particular
4/4/24, 10:55 pm - James: Chelski blew a two goal lead
4/4/24, 10:55 pm - James: They love 11th
4/4/24, 11:19 pm - Liam: Did everyone just see that lol
4/4/24, 11:36 pm - James: How many pens do chelks get
4/4/24, 11:36 pm - James: Every palmer goal is a pen
4/4/24, 11:36 pm - James: And he's scored about 15
4/4/24, 11:36 pm - Jono: Happy Friday
4/4/24, 11:38 pm - James: Palmer will miss one in the euros
4/4/24, 11:40 pm - Jono: Just saw the last goal… that’s as bad as Barca defending the corner taken quickly ORIGIIIII
4/4/24, 11:45 pm - Dave: I’m pretty sure United’s defending is bottom 3 in the league. Think they are third for most shots faced?
4/4/24, 11:48 pm - Jono: Poor Onana
4/4/24, 11:50 pm - Louie: Honestly, how hard is it to park the bus and not concede a penalty 🤦‍♂️
5/4/24, 12:08 am - Gerrard: I've missed so much

5/4/24, 3:13 am - James: Brighton snatched varpools hands off for the money

5/4/24, 3:16 am - Gerrard: I blame the guru
5/4/24, 3:17 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 start talking about school and you may bring him back
5/4/24, 3:17 am - James: South London Forever
5/4/24, 3:18 am - Gerrard: What's the song they like?
5/4/24, 3:18 am - James: Google it
5/4/24, 3:18 am - Gerrard: The one about prosititues
5/4/24, 4:19 am - Pero: Comparing apples with apples, quality assessment based on limited games
5/4/24, 4:20 am - Pero: Cmon jono I want to see you say Mrs baroni or Susan
5/4/24, 4:20 am - Gerrard: Apples with a rotted plum
5/4/24, 4:21 am - Jono: What was the science teacher's name again?
5/4/24, 4:21 am - Pero: Hahaha our minds are in sync . Ms venticinque
5/4/24, 4:22 am - Pero: Ms 20double d tits
5/4/24, 4:24 am - Jono: She was no Baroni - but still a winner
5/4/24, 4:24 am - Jono: Her holiday house was right across from ours on one south coast holiday when we were in year 9 
(I've probably told this story already but its still worth a recycle)
5/4/24, 4:25 am - Jono: Was wanking up a storm that trip
5/4/24, 4:32 am - Pero: 😂😂 brilliant. You were down south every 2nd weekend. You could do peep shows
5/4/24, 4:33 am - Jono: I was. Chris Luketic wasn’t far away from ours. We dreamt of a gang bang
5/4/24, 4:50 am - Pero: Ahh yes big gang bangs in calala
5/4/24, 4:56 am - Dave: Honestly. Liverpool fans were Endo this and Endo that and Mac was bang average flop of the year until two games ago. Liverpool fans have definitely changed their tune
5/4/24, 4:56 am - Dave: Well deserved
5/4/24, 4:58 am - Dave: Classic Brighton wheeler dealer deal. Only transfer worth the money from that club is Benny Blanco. 

Todd boehly was sharing a pipe with jezzy when he paid 115m for caicedo
5/4/24, 5:01 am - Gerrard: Honestly
5/4/24, 5:02 am - Dave: Give it a shot
5/4/24, 5:03 am - Dave: I’d be a nervous wreck after today’s game if I was a Liverpool fan
5/4/24, 5:03 am - Gerrard: Honestly, this time I'm telling the truth
5/4/24, 5:03 am - Dave: Enjoy top while it lasts
5/4/24, 5:03 am - Gerrard: Honestly
5/4/24, 5:03 am - Gerrard: Because you've grown up an AFTV fan
5/4/24, 5:03 am - Gerrard: Honestly
5/4/24, 5:04 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 Honestly
5/4/24, 5:06 am - Gerrard: @14244893404
5/4/24, 5:06 am - Gerrard: .......Honestly
5/4/24, 5:34 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5XSnf6tBSX/?igsh=ZGp2b2ozejF3MzB3
5/4/24, 5:34 am - Gerrard: Jo'burg eh
5/4/24, 5:58 am - James: I have failed you
5/4/24, 5:59 am - Gerrard: Crying happy
5/4/24, 6:00 am - Dave: Might be as early as this weekend. At ye olde theatre of dreams
5/4/24, 6:02 am - Gerrard: Arsenal to win all their remaining games?
5/4/24, 6:03 am - Pero: Livo did look shakey this morning could of been another 2 or 3 goals from Sheffield
5/4/24, 6:03 am - Gerrard: Luton?
5/4/24, 6:08 am - Dave: Real shakey. Sheffield very unlucky not to come away with something from that game
5/4/24, 6:10 am - James: Imagine
5/4/24, 6:11 am - James: Scousers at work are worried about this weekend
5/4/24, 6:11 am - Dave: Na. We’ve got champions league as well. Got to go for both. We’ll drop points for sure at some point. 

You’ve only got the league to focus on so it’s yours to lose. Just think that shakey performance shows nerves are getting to Liverpool, squeaky bum time.
5/4/24, 6:11 am - James: I didn't even know they were playing each other
5/4/24, 6:12 am - James: Weird how there is so many Varpool fans atm
5/4/24, 6:12 am - Dave: United will show up for sure. And it’s at old Trafford
5/4/24, 6:12 am - James: Like people I know all of a sudden like football and follow varpool
5/4/24, 6:12 am - James: Where were they last season
5/4/24, 6:12 am - Dave: Bunch of Jezzy’s suddenly coming out the woodwork
5/4/24, 6:13 am - James: Like this group just died
5/4/24, 6:13 am - Dave: Abandoning group chats and setting up Liverpool fan only groups to mourn in confinement
5/4/24, 6:13 am - Dave: Then invited us back when they started winning again to fling shit
5/4/24, 6:14 am - Gerrard: Scary being 1st
5/4/24, 6:14 am - James: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5WswljoDUt/?igsh=eDYwZzJuY2VyanFp
5/4/24, 6:14 am - James: Not a single manc spotted but a good vid
5/4/24, 6:14 am - James: Cuz blud init
5/4/24, 6:15 am - Gerrard: I only invited you back to shit off Jimmity
5/4/24, 6:15 am - Gerrard: How could I have known that you would turn into the most toxic one
5/4/24, 6:16 am - James: Sounding like a true white western woman there
5/4/24, 6:16 am - James: Heard that one so many times
5/4/24, 6:16 am - Dave: Forgot about that. “I’ll make everyone an admin apart from James to really piss him off”
5/4/24, 6:17 am - Dave: “Hopefully he’ll leave”
5/4/24, 6:17 am - Dave: And I’m the toxic one?!
5/4/24, 6:17 am - James: Did it work?
5/4/24, 6:19 am - James: Cole Palmer's hatty the worst ever?
5/4/24, 6:19 am - James: Didn't Jackson score an equally terrible one at spurs?
5/4/24, 6:20 am - Dave: Clearly
5/4/24, 6:23 am - Gerrard: Curly buckled and made you admin too
5/4/24, 6:28 am - James: Riveting
5/4/24, 7:00 am - Dave: Sorry, just wanted James to feel included
5/4/24, 7:11 am - James: Nunez's goal 😂😂😂
5/4/24, 7:11 am - James: He celebrated it too
5/4/24, 7:12 am - Jono: What’s wrong with that? I used to love those type of goals
5/4/24, 7:12 am - Jono: My motto was always celebrate every goal like it’s your last one
5/4/24, 7:12 am - Jono: Sth American thing
5/4/24, 7:19 am - Gerrard: Cambridge don't know football
5/4/24, 7:19 am - Jono: https://x.com/nocontext_fantv/status/1776003400498331953?s=48
5/4/24, 7:41 am - Gerrard: Thanks for that Jono
5/4/24, 8:34 pm - Jono: Terrible
5/4/24, 8:51 pm - Dave: “Spoon fed and butchered 4000 G/A”
5/4/24, 8:53 pm - Jono: https://x.com/nocontextfooty/status/1776247517832753368?s=48
5/4/24, 9:07 pm - James: That in 2 seasons!?
5/4/24, 9:07 pm - James: For £100m?
5/4/24, 9:08 pm - Jono: Just this season thankfully 😅
5/4/24, 9:09 pm - James: I was going to say 😂
5/4/24, 9:09 pm - Jono: There’d be a decent amount of defenders with similar stats I reckon
5/4/24, 9:11 pm - Dave: Only £3m a goal plus £400k a week 🤤
5/4/24, 9:11 pm - James: Tbf Jesus ain't much better
5/4/24, 9:11 pm - Dave: Pretty sure he’s up there lol.
5/4/24, 9:12 pm - James: Which we alllll said when you guys wanked over signing him
5/4/24, 9:12 pm - Dave: Jesus was only 40 tbf. But agree, he’s not worth the money either
5/4/24, 9:12 pm - Jono: Beat me to it
5/4/24, 9:12 pm - Dave: I’d be very happy to see the back of Jesus in the summer. Great player, just not what we need
5/4/24, 9:12 pm - James: Don't think he's great at all
5/4/24, 9:15 pm - Dave: He’s a skilled playmaker, high work rate, has his moments of absolute brilliance
5/4/24, 9:15 pm - Dave: Just can’t rely on him to score simple goals
5/4/24, 9:15 pm - Jono: Darwin’s 24 and still got plenty to offer. Some players show their worth quicker than others. We got lucky over the years with Salah, Mane for example shining from the outset. 

Darwin came in much younger than those guys. He’s yet to provide that ROI but his stats this season if maintained over 3 or 4 seasons that he’s absolutely been worth it
5/4/24, 9:16 pm - Dave: And always seems to be one step away from where he should be positionally which drives me fucking crazy
5/4/24, 9:20 pm - Dave: Agree. I know I sling shit at him but I actually really like Darwin. I think he’d fit in well at arsenal, add an element of unpredictability and chaos to our attack. Jesus and Eddie are way too hesitant in front of goal. Id take Nunez over Eddie and Jesus
6/4/24, 5:59 am - Gerrard: Aw nauh
6/4/24, 6:00 am - Liam: Been shit the last few years to be fair. Blessing in disguise
6/4/24, 6:01 am - Gerrard: Aw nauh bra
6/4/24, 6:05 am - Liam: Ya he’s been poor
6/4/24, 6:06 am - Liam: Injuries, hasn’t been available
6/4/24, 6:07 am - Liam: Nothing like his first 2 years
6/4/24, 6:07 am - Liam: Don’t need that on the wage bill
6/4/24, 6:07 am - Gerrard: Bra
6/4/24, 6:08 am - Jono: So sad 😞 anyone got rope?
6/4/24, 6:22 am - James: Salah next?
6/4/24, 6:22 am - Gerrard: Aw gawd
6/4/24, 6:23 am - James: Is he?
6/4/24, 6:39 am - Gerrard: Brah nuah
6/4/24, 6:39 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/gv4EIDrbPvw?si=fo-FRIsx2p8bvqyN
6/4/24, 6:48 am - Pero: Will there be any club loyalty after klopp leaves ?
6/4/24, 6:49 am - Jono: Probably not. You can all breathe again
6/4/24, 6:49 am - Gerrard: Pretty sure the fans will continue fanning
6/4/24, 6:49 am - Jono: I’m hearing Trent wants out too
6/4/24, 6:56 am - Gerrard: Awwwww nauuuuuuuuh
6/4/24, 7:00 am - James: Whispers are Chelsea
6/4/24, 7:00 am - Jono: I’m hearing Gooners
6/4/24, 7:04 am - Gerrard: I heard Sydney fc
6/4/24, 7:05 am - Liam: Teams full of snakes
6/4/24, 7:05 am - Liam: All Mikel’s boys signed new contracts
6/4/24, 8:30 am - James: Negative
6/4/24, 8:32 am - Liam: Your teams shit too
6/4/24, 8:51 am - Dave: Cya. Burnt out cunt

6/4/24, 8:55 am - Gerrard: I wasn't gonna say it but @61478754484 was singing You'll Never Walk Alone again last Monday
6/4/24, 8:56 am - Dave: @61478754484 true?
6/4/24, 8:56 am - Liam: Absolutely not.
6/4/24, 8:56 am - Gerrard: Then he sang and danced to that 'I'm Coming Up' song after Livo went top and Arsenal dropped
6/4/24, 8:57 am - Gerrard: Stop lying
6/4/24, 9:02 am - James: Fuck
6/4/24, 9:03 am - Liam: Didn’t happen
6/4/24, 9:03 am - Liam: Liverpool are a joke
6/4/24, 9:03 am - James: OMG
6/4/24, 9:06 am - Dave: Cooked
6/4/24, 9:07 am - Dave: Tried
6/4/24, 9:07 am - Dave: Tried hard
6/4/24, 9:08 am - Dave: Met a boatload of Liverpool fans tonight
6/4/24, 9:08 am - Dave: Shutting their panties about United 🤓
6/4/24, 9:12 am - Gerrard: Only hurting yourself with your persistent lies
6/4/24, 9:25 am - Gerrard: Did you draw that?
6/4/24, 9:26 am - Liam: Master piece, worth more than you could ever imagine.
6/4/24, 9:26 am - Dave: Yea.
6/4/24, 9:26 am - Dave: Like a fuckign Banksy
6/4/24, 9:26 am - Gerrard: Wow
6/4/24, 12:16 pm - Gerrard: Everything to do with that club is wank
6/4/24, 12:22 pm - Gerrard: Wank
6/4/24, 7:35 pm - Jono: Dodgy pen. Ball first
6/4/24, 7:36 pm - Jono: VARsenal are here to stay
6/4/24, 7:52 pm - Dave: Clear pen my friend
6/4/24, 8:04 pm - Jono: https://x.com/eplbible/status/1776669545702318471?s=48

Jesus went down almost as easily as Whitey
6/4/24, 8:11 pm - Dave: Can smell fear in here

7/4/24, 1:08 am - Dave: Prediction tomorrow?
7/4/24, 1:09 am - Gerrard: Arsenal don't win the title
7/4/24, 1:11 am - Gerrard: Are we all gonna stop talking like Aston Villa are good now?
7/4/24, 1:41 am - Pero: Gunners doing the job again 👊
7/4/24, 2:17 am - Dave: Never thought they were that good. Knew those “Emery is the best manager in the league” comments would dry up at record speed
7/4/24, 2:17 am - Gerrard: Better than Arteta though
7/4/24, 2:20 am - Dave: Meth pipe gif incoming
7/4/24, 2:21 am - Dave: How good is Havertz man
7/4/24, 2:21 am - Dave: Ball iq is elite
7/4/24, 2:22 am - Gerrard: Havertz would be a better manager than Arteta
7/4/24, 3:37 am - Pero: The man is on🔥
7/4/24, 3:38 am - Liam: Signing of the season?
7/4/24, 4:15 am - Pero: Offt tough call, if he wins us the league by scoring the winning goal in the last rounds he will be
7/4/24, 8:24 am - James: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5beUfqq_6A/?igsh=bzJ1dmJ0ZHAxYXpt

7/4/24, 6:13 pm - Shaun: Someone is gonna lose points
7/4/24, 9:11 pm - James: 😬
7/4/24, 9:42 pm - James: Quiet
7/4/24, 9:43 pm - James: Did they just bottle?
7/4/24, 10:17 pm - Gerrard: Awww nuaaaar

7/4/24, 10:26 pm - James: Huuuuh yeaaaaa
7/4/24, 10:26 pm - Gerrard: Arsenal are bottlers if they don't win the league from here?
7/4/24, 10:26 pm - James: Varpool had a four point lead?
7/4/24, 10:26 pm - James: That right?
7/4/24, 10:26 pm - Gerrard: When?
7/4/24, 10:27 pm - James: Someone confirm please
7/4/24, 10:27 pm - Gerrard: I haven't looked at the table yet, against the rules innit
7/4/24, 10:27 pm - James: Looks tired
7/4/24, 10:27 pm - Gerrard: I'm tired
7/4/24, 10:28 pm - Dave: Correct sir
7/4/24, 10:29 pm - James: So he's saying his team aren't a good football team
7/4/24, 10:29 pm - Dave: Pretty much
7/4/24, 10:29 pm - James: Weird comment
7/4/24, 10:29 pm - Gerrard: Awww nuaaaar
7/4/24, 10:29 pm - Dave: Reckon that’ll do wonders for the lads confidence after just dropping points AGAIN to the worst United side in 3 decades
7/4/24, 10:30 pm - Dave: “Arsenal are better than us”
7/4/24, 10:30 pm - James: I read a report saying manure were awful. Left spaces all over the midfield
7/4/24, 10:30 pm - Jono: That’s correct tbh 
He’s just saying we should’ve won too. Missed too many chances
7/4/24, 10:30 pm - James: Manure should be 16th apparently
7/4/24, 10:30 pm - James: Terrible team
7/4/24, 10:30 pm - Dave: Mate. First thing I turned around and said was “these guys are title challengers?”
7/4/24, 10:31 pm - Jono: I missed the game but looked pretty much like the FA cup one
7/4/24, 10:31 pm - Gerrard: Liverpool took too much inspiration from the "Invincibles", too many draws
7/4/24, 10:31 pm - James: So when citeh win the league again, who bottled?
7/4/24, 10:31 pm - Gerrard: I know this didn't happen lol
7/4/24, 10:31 pm - Dave: Nothing about today and Sheffield says Liverpool are winning this title. 

Need to make some big changes. Still think they’ve got it in them, easy run and only Europa, but definitely need to go back to the drawing board
7/4/24, 10:32 pm - James: Ten steps back in the summer though. No klippy, no klappy
7/4/24, 10:32 pm - Gerrard: Love the early talk, keep it up
7/4/24, 10:32 pm - James: Citeh looked good
7/4/24, 10:32 pm - James: I watched the palace game
7/4/24, 10:32 pm - Gerrard: 💯 Arsenal
7/4/24, 10:32 pm - James: Foden didn't even get on
7/4/24, 10:32 pm - Dave: They did
7/4/24, 10:33 pm - Dave: City getting back in form
7/4/24, 10:33 pm - Gerrard: Looked good for a team in 3rd
7/4/24, 10:33 pm - Gerrard: Couldn't even beat Arsenal last week, they done
7/4/24, 10:40 pm - Dave: Neither could you lad. Over 2 years
7/4/24, 10:40 pm - Gerrard: I love how you exclude non league games
7/4/24, 10:41 pm - Gerrard: @14244893404 you're the ETH of this group chat
7/4/24, 10:43 pm - Dave: Are we not talking about the league here? Is this not a discussion on bottling the title? It’s been over two years since you beat us in the league
7/4/24, 10:44 pm - Gerrard: We can talk about whatever you want Curly
7/4/24, 10:45 pm - Gerrard: I just love seeing you happy for once
7/4/24, 10:55 pm - Dave: I’ve had a fantastic weekend. Don’t worry, I’ll be sad again on Tuesday
7/4/24, 11:25 pm - Liam: Bottle jobs!
7/4/24, 11:54 pm - James: How many points clear was it
8/4/24, 12:12 am - Dave: 4?
8/4/24, 12:54 am - Gerrard: Poor Quansah
8/4/24, 1:00 am - Pero: lucky wan bisaka is so stupid
8/4/24, 1:02 am - Dave: Honestly. Threw away the win
8/4/24, 1:08 am - Pero: Just like goldbridge said, it's like preparing a lovely dinner party, going upstairs to get changed , and coming back down to realise your cat has taken a shit on the table 🤣
8/4/24, 1:17 am - James: Haven't beat manure all season?
8/4/24, 1:25 am - James: I just read somewhere that manure took 4 points from Varpool this season and knocked them out the FA Cup
8/4/24, 1:29 am - Liam: Fact ✅
8/4/24, 1:46 am - Dave: Nope. Worst side in 3/4 decades and Klapps title challengers can’t get past them
8/4/24, 1:46 am - Dave: You did say VARpool wouldn’t actually beat anyone this season @61452662705. Hats off
8/4/24, 1:48 am - James: I said 'who they beat' often. Looks like just villa from the current top 6?
8/4/24, 1:50 am - Dave: Facts
8/4/24, 1:50 am - James: 6 pts?
8/4/24, 1:50 am - James: 8pts?
8/4/24, 1:51 am - James: 1 win, 5 draws?
8/4/24, 2:00 am - Dave: Um. Top 6 this season. Lost to Arsenal and spurs. Drew against United and city. Beat Villa once. 2 losses, 5 draws and 1 win?
8/4/24, 2:00 am - Dave: W   D   L
 1 - 5 - 2

Title contenders @61452662705
8/4/24, 2:05 am - Gerrard: 2nd by only goal difference.

Title contenders @14244893404
8/4/24, 2:05 am - Gerrard: Must be an English thing
8/4/24, 2:06 am - Gerrard: Facts aren't facts unless the facts factually support the facts being facted for their purpose.
8/4/24, 2:17 am - Dave: Racist
8/4/24, 2:22 am - Liam: Head has gone
8/4/24, 2:45 am - Gerrard: Here's another rattle @14244893404: The refs are taking the title away from Klopp because he crictises them....
8/4/24, 2:51 am - Gerrard: Rattle me up
8/4/24, 2:51 am - Gerrard: I'm all in
8/4/24, 2:51 am - Gerrard: Refs hate Klopp
English hate Liverpool
8/4/24, 2:52 am - Liam: Not worth mentioning, evens itself out over the season. Just shut up and play football like proper blokes.
8/4/24, 2:52 am - Dave: Remember that jota dive lol
8/4/24, 2:53 am - Liam: Scored the most goals, conceded the least, I would say league table looks about right.
8/4/24, 2:54 am - Liam: Or does Klopp get extra points because hes leaving ?
8/4/24, 2:55 am - James: What is happening in here 😳
8/4/24, 3:07 am - Gerrard: I'm rattling
8/4/24, 3:08 am - Dave: Farewell tour isn’t going too good is it.
8/4/24, 3:09 am - Dave: Can see the tweets already. “The quadruple was stolen from us, football is ruined!”
8/4/24, 3:11 am - James: Why what heppend?
8/4/24, 3:19 am - Liam: Liverpool should have more points, but refs done them.
8/4/24, 3:20 am - Gerrard: Work sucks, the guy before me left a mess and just had my one guy in Melbourne resigned today. <This message was edited>
8/4/24, 3:21 am - Gerrard: Also got 128x VSDs I got to get out of a building and to a recycling joint
8/4/24, 3:58 am - James: Klopp resigning as well
8/4/24, 3:59 am - Gerrard: Klopp doesn't affect my projects innit
8/4/24, 4:00 am - James: You should resign
8/4/24, 4:00 am - James: Problems solved
8/4/24, 4:04 am - Gerrard: Then no rent money, problem gained
8/4/24, 5:46 am - Dave: Dust off your leccy license. Go work with jimmity. He’s got some scouse buddies at work you can shack up with and suck off in the mess huts
8/4/24, 5:47 am - Gerrard: I've seen how he got when Newty was above Liverpool, don't want to work under him.
8/4/24, 5:59 am - Dave: Have you fitting off GPOs for 2 months straight if Liverpool beat Newty
8/4/24, 6:02 am - James: I'm not nice to work with
8/4/24, 6:04 am - James: No Jez's allowed
8/4/24, 6:05 am - Gerrard: Plus all us controls guys are soft, I remember you saying @14244893404
8/4/24, 6:08 am - Dave: You’d be a quivering mess in the corner after a week with Jimmity
8/4/24, 6:09 am - Gerrard: I think I'd be a happier man with the phone not ringing and just wiring shit. <This message was edited>
8/4/24, 6:43 am - James: Plus 12k steps on average per day 🤙

9/4/24, 7:28 am - Dave: And vice versa
9/4/24, 7:28 am - Gerrard: Nah I was lying

9/4/24, 7:34 am - Gerrard: Gotta wear shades?

9/4/24, 7:34 am - Dave: We’re both on the up ❤️

9/4/24, 7:39 am - Gerrard: First chance Barca knock, or Chelsea
9/4/24, 7:39 am - James: Real?
9/4/24, 7:39 am - James: Carlo getting on
9/4/24, 7:40 am - James: And what a squad they have
9/4/24, 7:40 am - Gerrard: Real getting Klopp after a year sabbatical
9/4/24, 7:40 am - Gerrard: Or Xabi
9/4/24, 7:40 am - James: Alfonso might have to do it again in Germany next season
9/4/24, 7:40 am - James: Then real
9/4/24, 7:41 am - Gerrard: Or Bayern chase Klopp after these dead years of Tuchel
9/4/24, 7:41 am - Gerrard: He is, he's staying
9/4/24, 7:41 am - James: He'll lose a lot of talent in the summer
9/4/24, 7:41 am - James: Wirtz especially
9/4/24, 7:41 am - Gerrard: Maybe not
9/4/24, 7:41 am - Gerrard: Maybe the old days of Bayern buy all is dead
9/4/24, 7:41 am - James: Kane can't catch a break
9/4/24, 7:42 am - James: Reckon if he went to Celtic they'd lose the league to Rangers
9/4/24, 7:42 am - James: He'd score 100 goals
9/4/24, 7:42 am - James: Still come 2nd
9/4/24, 7:43 am - James: Greek orthodox mate
9/4/24, 7:49 am - Dave: And we’re not? We’re statistically improving year on year and you’re statistically declining. Odd take
9/4/24, 7:50 am - Dave: Cursed

9/4/24, 12:06 pm - Jono: Me ⬆️
9/4/24, 12:26 pm - Gerrard: @61404060785 imagine Liverpool win it with all the injuries to such key players, the juniors playing, some Irish kid in goals - Cinderella story it would be
9/4/24, 12:27 pm - Gerrard: Can't believe we're level with this best Arsenal team there's ever been and 1pt ahead of this treble winning City team.
Amazing.
9/4/24, 12:27 pm - Gerrard: Truly exceptional
9/4/24, 12:27 pm - Gerrard: @61404060785 pinch me
9/4/24, 4:13 pm - Dave: Second. You’re second
9/4/24, 10:32 pm - James: Varsenal
9/4/24, 10:32 pm - James: What's happening
9/4/24, 10:32 pm - James: Bayern are shit
9/4/24, 10:32 pm - James: Kane scored
9/4/24, 10:42 pm - Gerrard: Lucky for Arsenal that the away goals rule changed
9/4/24, 10:44 pm - James: Some game in Madrid
9/4/24, 10:57 pm - Jono: Some player tho 😅
9/4/24, 11:02 pm - Dave: Showing their experience. We gave away two VERY sloppy goals
9/4/24, 11:02 pm - Dave: Shame. Should have won that.
9/4/24, 11:03 pm - Dave: A draw going into the second leg isn’t the worst result. Not sure we will make it to the semis if we play like that at the Allianz though
9/4/24, 11:45 pm - Gerrard: #rorywasright
#justiceforrory
9/4/24, 11:56 pm - Pero: Very sloppy goals. Looks like a fair result bayern hit the post in the end and do you think saka could have kept going with the nuer clip in the 94th ?
10/4/24, 12:27 am - Dave: Think saka was looking for it after replay
10/4/24, 1:13 am - Pero: Yeh he was. How good was jesus / trossard combo leading to goal
10/4/24, 1:13 am - Pero: We can get a win next week
10/4/24, 2:04 am - Gerrard: https://youtu.be/zj7rEL-T0FY?si=i8r_NAiRCQH0-yFZ
10/4/24, 3:41 am - James: What were salibs and gabribs up to?
10/4/24, 3:41 am - James: Gnabry against the gooners 😬
10/4/24, 3:41 am - James: And Kane!
10/4/24, 3:41 am - Dave: Yeah that hurt
10/4/24, 3:42 am - Dave: First goal was embarrassing. Raya basically ran up to the halfway, total joke
10/4/24, 3:42 am - James: Saka diving
10/4/24, 3:42 am - Dave: Pen conceded was frustrating, but definitely a pen. Good bit of play by Bayern
10/4/24, 3:43 am - Dave: Lol. Ok
10/4/24, 3:43 am - James: That was a dive 😂
10/4/24, 3:43 am - Dave: Jesus assist was sexy as fuck
10/4/24, 3:43 am - James: Stuck his leg out
10/4/24, 3:43 am - Dave: Got brutally mauled by neuer
10/4/24, 3:43 am - James: 🏊‍♀
10/4/24, 3:43 am - Dave: Just like Diaz dive hey mate. 0 contact right?
10/4/24, 3:44 am - James: Diogo Saka
10/4/24, 3:47 am - James: All I saw was saka diving
10/4/24, 3:47 am - James: And foden scoring a banger
10/4/24, 4:01 am - Gerrard: Get AAron back in
10/4/24, 4:01 am - Gerrard: Big time
10/4/24, 4:06 am - Dave: Must have missed Saka’s banger then
10/4/24, 4:06 am - Gerrard: I heard Saka didn't show up again
10/4/24, 4:13 am - James: Foden 22 goals, 10 assists. It's over for Saksy
10/4/24, 4:13 am - James: That's what they keep saying
10/4/24, 4:14 am - Gerrard: Why would anyone compare Saka with Foden?
10/4/24, 4:14 am - Gerrard: Completely different kinds of players
10/4/24, 4:16 am - Gerrard: Foden wins, can win games on his own, playing in a top worldwide team, he can shoot and pass, great ball control, positioning great, established
10/4/24, 4:16 am - Gerrard: Saka might be a good player one day
10/4/24, 4:18 am - James: Fuck fuck fuck! 😳
10/4/24, 4:28 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5jUG_xJbJj/?igsh=bndtZ3Z5Y2dsN3Y4

10/4/24, 4:53 am - Pero: He scored ? With a lovely finish
10/4/24, 4:54 am - Gerrard: Did he do much else?
10/4/24, 4:57 am - Pero: Wasn't his best game but still made impact. Could of had a pen in the end
10/4/24, 4:58 am - Gerrard: This but Saka @61422023136
10/4/24, 5:02 am - Pero: Is this saying he doesn't score goals ?
10/4/24, 5:03 am - Gerrard: Only against little teams
(And yes relax, his one against Livo was a tap in off a rebound)
10/4/24, 6:16 am - Pero: https://www.facebook.com/share/v/VQFtKM7qDUnj9X4j/?mibextid=wILeQC

Have a look at this angle. Disgusting how this is not a pen
10/4/24, 6:20 am - Gerrard: Dirty bastard put his foot in so he made contact and dove
10/4/24, 6:27 am - Dave: Should have had a pen. Neuer stuck his leg out. It’s the only reason VARpool got a point against United when Harvey Elliot did EXACTLY the same thing but it was way more obvious
10/4/24, 6:29 am - Dave: Haven’t seen this angle. How the fuck did that not go to
VAR
10/4/24, 6:30 am - Dave: So obvious
10/4/24, 6:56 am - Pero: A million percent if that went to var it would of been a pen . So obvious
10/4/24, 6:58 am - Gerrard: Why didn't it go to VAR?
10/4/24, 6:58 am - Dave: 💯
10/4/24, 6:58 am - Gerrard: But why not VAR?
10/4/24, 6:58 am - Dave: What about Gabriel getting elbowed in the face by Kane
10/4/24, 6:58 am - Dave: Ref clearly had an issue with brown people
10/4/24, 6:58 am - Gerrard: Doesn't sound like something Kane would do
10/4/24, 6:59 am - Pero: Gutless officiating
10/4/24, 6:59 am - Pero: Too scared to make a major call
10/4/24, 6:59 am - Dave: Kane looked at him before trying to knock his teeth out
10/4/24, 6:59 am - Dave: Knew exactly where he was
10/4/24, 7:03 am - Pero: Another bruno G
10/4/24, 7:03 am - Gerrard: But then why wasn't it a red card?
10/4/24, 7:39 am - James: Terrible defending and keeping for Saky goal
10/4/24, 7:40 am - James: Why did he close his body so he could do the only thing he ever does?
10/4/24, 7:40 am - James: Keeper too slow
10/4/24, 7:40 am - James: Foden is levels ahead
10/4/24, 7:40 am - Jono: Bellingham diving too (plus Saka and Elliott over the weekend). I remember when the Brits used to get all stroppy about only South Americans doing it.
10/4/24, 7:40 am - Gerrard: Saka is predictable, but Bayern are in a huge rut right now
10/4/24, 7:43 am - James: PSG shouldn't even be in the competition
10/4/24, 7:43 am - Gerrard: Wow
10/4/24, 7:43 am - James: We beat them twice
10/4/24, 7:43 am - James: Robbed
10/4/24, 7:43 am - Gerrard: Turning on your oil brethren
10/4/24, 7:43 am - Gerrard: It's Eid bro
10/4/24, 7:43 am - James: They're the diet coke of oil
10/4/24, 7:43 am - Jono: Oily war
10/4/24, 7:44 am - Gerrard: You think the English know about Eid?
10/4/24, 7:44 am - James: Sugar free oil
10/4/24, 7:47 am - Jono: I always misread Eid and EAD
10/4/24, 7:50 am - Gerrard: Understandable
10/4/24, 7:51 am - Dave: Why wasn’t Bruno G a red card? Exactly
10/4/24, 7:51 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 did you know that @14244893404 was in the National Front?
10/4/24, 7:52 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 got him out
10/4/24, 7:53 am - Dave: Nasty accusation to make
10/4/24, 7:53 am - Gerrard: Didn't think it was an accusation, @61478754484 told me that story
10/4/24, 7:54 am - James: Saka jumped into the keeper 😂
10/4/24, 7:54 am - James: Why didn't he just round him and tap it in
10/4/24, 7:54 am - James: Foden would have
10/4/24, 7:59 am - Jono: Nice goal from Saka tbh
But Foden’s was better
10/4/24, 7:59 am - Jono: Foden is better than Saka 
Let’s stop this nonsense
10/4/24, 8:00 am - Pero: Offt @61404060785 coming in with the curve ball bringing up some old skeletons
10/4/24, 8:00 am - Jono: Only here for truth bombs. We know the Brits think they’re all prim and proper and never put a foot wrong
10/4/24, 8:01 am - Jono: Truth is we’re all cunts
10/4/24, 8:04 am - James: They didn't want to hear it though?
10/4/24, 8:04 am - James: Have they changed their minds yet 🤔
10/4/24, 8:05 am - Gerrard: 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 <This message was edited>
10/4/24, 8:08 am - Jono: Love it when Darwizzy stats bring everyone back to earth

The Arteta crybaby mentoring program in full effect
10/4/24, 8:34 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 disgrace?
10/4/24, 8:34 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 embarrassing? <This message was edited>
10/4/24, 8:41 am - James: Just want to hear 'Foden is better than Saka. You were right all along'
10/4/24, 8:41 am - Gerrard: Well I agree
10/4/24, 8:41 am - Gerrard: Good luck with the cultists
10/4/24, 8:48 am - Jono: #cryboy
10/4/24, 8:50 am - Pero: Saka is usually calm and collected for him to be pissed like that means for sure it was a pen
10/4/24, 9:24 am - Gerrard: Or Arteta got to him <This message was edited>
10/4/24, 9:24 am - Gerrard: Bad team ethic
10/4/24, 9:24 am - Gerrard: Bad team morals
10/4/24, 9:56 am - Pero: It's passion
10/4/24, 10:31 am - Gerrard: But not when Klopp does it?
@61452662705 double standard
10/4/24, 11:09 am - Jono: Wanted more penalty redemption after Euros
10/4/24, 11:28 am - Pero: Not when klopp dishes out personal insults to people for asking simple post match questions
10/4/24, 12:32 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 I don't know the rules anymore
10/4/24, 12:50 pm - Jono: https://www.facebook.com/share/v/5KJtCaCGuMNViub1/?

10/4/24, 12:50 pm - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5d4uNYt9Qi/?igsh=MWlpaXJvMGdiMDA3OQ==
10/4/24, 12:53 pm - Gerrard: So bad, and the arrogance
10/4/24, 12:54 pm - Gerrard: Reason no.97 why I'm glad I'm not an Arsenal fan.
10/4/24, 1:05 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 just saw the highlights, I haven't seen a keeper get sat down like that since the early 2000s
10/4/24, 1:14 pm - Dave: Love how everyone just forgets Klopp told a journalist he’s morbidly obese for asking a valid question. Poor bloke was just trying to do his job. Or what about that fan who wanted his shirt signing that Klapp blew up at? 

The classic Liverpool, hypocritical double standard. Then when anyone brings it up they revert to victim mindset. “It’s beCaUse noOnE liKeS LiVeRpOol!!! FReE LIveRpOOl”

15/4/24, 1:59 am - Jono: Some ridiculous saves
15/4/24, 2:00 am - Jono: The most ridiculous one was actually Alisson off Mateta's shot from 6 yards out
15/4/24, 2:00 am - Jono: Reminded me of Dudek in the 05 CL final
15/4/24, 2:00 am - Gerrard: But hey guys, I think we can all agree, at least we aren't Newty
15/4/24, 2:12 am - Pero: Just seen that again 🤣 ffs

15/4/24, 3:42 am - Gerrard: Nice angle, who's loss is worse
15/4/24, 3:44 am - James: Klippy doing the 'wows' on the touchline
15/4/24, 3:44 am - James: Looks like palace had their fair share of chances
15/4/24, 3:46 am - Gerrard: Yeah 5 shots on to Liverpool's 6, are you reading anyone else's messages on here or just yelling into the void?
15/4/24, 3:48 am - James: What a goal from my POTY Watkins!

18/4/24, 8:12 am - James: Ya. Didn't get past first man
18/4/24, 8:12 am - James: Terrible
18/4/24, 8:13 am - Gerrard: I'd keep all Arsenal players away from any important
18/4/24, 8:13 am - Gerrard: Trent has taken good pens in shootouts for Liverpool
18/4/24, 8:14 am - Gerrard: If, I'm assuming, England wants to win
18/4/24, 8:14 am - James: Losers. Loser mentality. Can show up when it means nothing
18/4/24, 8:14 am - James: Gotta bin off light bulb wanker if they want a monster mentality
18/4/24, 8:15 am - James: Maguire hits em good
18/4/24, 8:15 am - Gerrard: Now Harry Kane, that guy's a real G, Spurs breeds them better - look at all the Spurs players that went on to win more CLs than Arsenal
18/4/24, 8:15 am - James: Starboy?
18/4/24, 8:16 am - James: Dier outclassed Varsenals whole attack
18/4/24, 8:16 am - Gerrard: I heard from the 3 in here that they'd rather have Starboy than Salah
18/4/24, 8:16 am - Jono: Maddison gonna make the squad? Can he take a pen? Would he get on the pitch?
18/4/24, 8:16 am - James: Dropped off this year. Doesn't deserve it
18/4/24, 8:16 am - Gerrard: If only potential won games....
18/4/24, 8:16 am - Jono: Hopefully those guys shitting on Salah’s big game stats have some Starboy ones too
18/4/24, 8:17 am - James: Can Salad take a corner?
18/4/24, 8:17 am - James: The bar is low
18/4/24, 8:17 am - Gerrard: But he scored a tap in against Liverpool bro
18/4/24, 8:17 am - James: Did saksy limp off?
18/4/24, 8:17 am - James: Or dive at all during the game
18/4/24, 8:17 am - Jono: She stayed down after heading a ball
18/4/24, 8:17 am - James: Poor baby
18/4/24, 8:18 am - Gerrard: I would assume he can do a fucksight better than Starboy's last effort
18/4/24, 8:18 am - James: I remember that
18/4/24, 8:18 am - James: And Martinelli was one of the best wingers in the world
18/4/24, 8:18 am - James: Jesus would win them the league
18/4/24, 8:18 am - James: Havertz unlocked
18/4/24, 8:18 am - Jono: Yeah Martinelli has let me down more than Szob
18/4/24, 8:19 am - Jono: (I rated them both)
18/4/24, 8:19 am - Gerrard: Salah has the talent, scoring, ball control, experience, winners medals...... But Starboy has - potential
18/4/24, 8:19 am - James: This is Salah's worst season so far for Varpool
18/4/24, 8:19 am - James: And he's still ahead of starboy
18/4/24, 8:19 am - Gerrard: Pero finally said he's not good enough last time I saw him
18/4/24, 8:20 am - James: Palmer
18/4/24, 8:20 am - Gerrard: Maybe next year thought bro
18/4/24, 8:20 am - Jono: Of course
18/4/24, 8:20 am - Gerrard: Palmer is the Real Starboy
18/4/24, 8:20 am - James: Saka is just Sean Wright Phillips
18/4/24, 8:20 am - Jono: Palmer is such a baller. One of his goals on Monday was pure class
18/4/24, 8:20 am - James: Regen
18/4/24, 8:20 am - Jono: The nutmeg one
18/4/24, 8:20 am - Gerrard: The first one was fifa
18/4/24, 8:21 am - James: Really unlikable though
18/4/24, 8:21 am - Gerrard: Wow spot on
18/4/24, 8:21 am - Gerrard: Def a rapist
18/4/24, 8:22 am - Dave: Unfortunately yes, he had an absolute stinker today
18/4/24, 8:22 am - Gerrard: TODAY????!!!!
18/4/24, 8:23 am - Dave: So bizarre watching it. Exactly the position odegaard would have slotted it in the back of the net from
18/4/24, 8:23 am - James: Hang on didn't see that bit
18/4/24, 8:23 am - James: So there was a FK within shooting distance and saksy played it to Benjamin? <This message was edited>
18/4/24, 8:24 am - Dave: Didn’t see any of it. Just aimlessly firing blanks like usual you smelly Jaffa
18/4/24, 8:24 am - James: Glad Ben white isn't going to the euros
18/4/24, 8:24 am - Jono: They didn’t have the broadcast shot on when Saka decided to pass it, it was just zoomed in on him where he basically took the FK while still getting up off the floor.
So I had assumed for him to make such a bold move it was absolutely certain they’d at least get a shot in from whoever was meant to receive it
18/4/24, 8:25 am - James: Hopefully sakashit doesn't go either
18/4/24, 8:25 am - Dave: Best right back in England
18/4/24, 8:25 am - Jono: I thought the ref was gonna pull it up coz he wasn’t standing up
18/4/24, 8:25 am - Jono: But he let play go and the next shot was the ball already intercepted for a corner
18/4/24, 8:25 am - Jono: I was stunned
18/4/24, 8:25 am - James: Rattle Rodders getting abusive now
18/4/24, 8:26 am - Pero: Lots of arsenal bashing in here after quarter final lose
18/4/24, 8:26 am - James: Nothing about what Varsenal do at this stage of the season should be a shock
18/4/24, 8:26 am - James: Everyone knew this would happen lol
18/4/24, 8:26 am - Dave: You were awfully quiet before the game
18/4/24, 8:26 am - Dave: Didn’t hear any mystic jimmity predictions
18/4/24, 8:27 am - Jono: I thought it was Varsenal’s for the taking tbh
18/4/24, 8:27 am - James: Because I don't watch your games. I was at work. And if I was able to, I'd have watched citeh v real
18/4/24, 8:27 am - James: Better team. Players etc
18/4/24, 8:27 am - Pero: Martinelli has been off since his injury a couple weeks ago. Until then he was a machine remember when he smoked the livo defensive like butter that was before he was injured
18/4/24, 8:27 am - Jono: So I kept quiet thinking you’d get em
18/4/24, 8:27 am - James: I caught up on the highlights at lunch though 😊
18/4/24, 8:28 am - James: Bayern are poor
18/4/24, 8:28 am - Dave: Martinelli and saka both off the boil for sure.
18/4/24, 8:28 am - James: Too good for Varsenal
18/4/24, 8:28 am - James: But still poor
18/4/24, 8:28 am - Dave: The lads just look tired
18/4/24, 8:28 am - Jono: Maybe Arteta needs to acknowledge this and start Trossard more in big games
18/4/24, 8:28 am - Jono: Trossard has been on song of late
18/4/24, 8:28 am - James: @61409710717 @61404060785 tired 😂
18/4/24, 8:28 am - Dave: Trossard is quality. Never seems to have the same impact starting as he does coming off the bench though
18/4/24, 8:28 am - James: Awww
18/4/24, 8:29 am - Dave: Ye, happens when you’re in all the competitions in business end of the season. 80% of your team got injuries when you had to play a couple of
Extra games, thought you’d understand better than anyone laddy
18/4/24, 8:29 am - Pero: Yeh funny about trossard always a game changer when he comes on. Not so much when starting
18/4/24, 8:30 am - James: Haven't even had time to scour for memes yet
18/4/24, 8:34 am - Jono: Unlock Trossard!
18/4/24, 8:34 am - Jono: Coz Havertz looks to be relocked
18/4/24, 8:39 am - Gerrard: Wow a lot of Arsenal fans messages....
18/4/24, 8:40 am - Gerrard: Darn it
18/4/24, 8:40 am - Gerrard: Someone get two lightbulbs and a longer extension lead
18/4/24, 8:51 am - Jono: Just realised both Pero’s teams lost today along with Croatian yips from the spot just before Euros 

Disastrous morning
18/4/24, 8:54 am - Liam: Great effort from the lads, happy they are continuing to develop and grow.
18/4/24, 8:58 am - Gerrard: Develop a losing mentality
18/4/24, 9:00 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 remember when Liverpool lost a CL then the next season won a CL, then lost the league by 1pt then next season won the league by a mile?
What has Arsenal done after losing every year?
18/4/24, 9:04 am - Liam: Well we might win the league
18/4/24, 9:05 am - Liam: This comes across rather aggressive
18/4/24, 9:05 am - Gerrard: This really shows that the FACup win was the team Emery built
18/4/24, 9:06 am - Liam: Great manager
18/4/24, 9:06 am - Liam: I wonder who will be your next manager
18/4/24, 9:15 am - Pero: I was waiting on gvardiol to take a pen and do the trifecta
18/4/24, 9:16 am - Jono: In fairness Rudiger told the keeper where to go for Kovacic’s pen
18/4/24, 9:16 am - Jono: But it was a terrible pen anyway
18/4/24, 9:16 am - Pero: Yeh rubbish pen
18/4/24, 9:17 am - Pero: Bernardo wins the prize for the worst
18/4/24, 9:18 am - Jono: Dweeby Portuguese cunt
18/4/24, 9:18 am - Pero: Michael Owen getting a call up ?
18/4/24, 9:19 am - Jono: Portugal minus Jota could well be my most hated international team atm
18/4/24, 9:20 am - Pero: Is it cause of jaeo Felix ?
18/4/24, 9:24 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 they've gone off topic 🧐
18/4/24, 9:44 am - Pero: Didn't realise there was a set topic ?
18/4/24, 10:04 am - James: Who's rattling
18/4/24, 10:04 am - James: So many unread messages
18/4/24, 10:07 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 could one say that Arteta has killed Martinelli's and Saka's careers?
18/4/24, 10:20 am - James: Heritage
18/4/24, 12:06 pm - Liam: Still being toxic? @61409710717 @61452662705
18/4/24, 12:07 pm - Gerrard: Whoa brother
18/4/24, 2:22 pm - Shaun: the last semi was back against manu?
18/4/24, 2:22 pm - Shaun: like 10 years ago? i think i remember that
18/4/24, 2:29 pm - Gerrard: Arsenal or Tottenham?
18/4/24, 2:29 pm - Gerrard: We knocked Arsenal out of the quarters when Torres was about
18/4/24, 6:53 pm - Dave: Alright that made me laugh at lot harder than it should have
18/4/24, 8:19 pm - Dave: The hate for Arsenal is real 😂😂😂 
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5G9OU8xebg/?igsh=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==
18/4/24, 10:05 pm - Jono: lol the donkey
18/4/24, 10:19 pm - Jono: Where’s Gini when you need him
18/4/24, 10:42 pm - Dave: Jones is quality. Ball just sticks to his feet
18/4/24, 10:56 pm - James: Another trophy of the farewell tour bits the dust ❌
18/4/24, 10:56 pm - James: Heritage
18/4/24, 10:57 pm - James: Atalanta
18/4/24, 10:57 pm - Dave: Europa. Atlanta. LOL. 

Quadruple - Europa, FA cup, title tbc. How many trophies does that equal @trent?
18/4/24, 10:57 pm - Dave: Reckon he can do the math @61452662705 ?
18/4/24, 10:57 pm - James: Wow
18/4/24, 10:57 pm - James: They only scored a pen 😂
18/4/24, 10:57 pm - Dave: Really “brought it to them”
18/4/24, 10:57 pm - James: Full strength too 💪
18/4/24, 10:58 pm - James: Pants pulled first leg
18/4/24, 10:58 pm - James: Dead and buried
18/4/24, 10:58 pm - Dave: Klopp in disbelief. What a farewell. Looked shite as well, watched last 20-25 mins. Like they didn’t want to be there
18/4/24, 10:59 pm - Dave: Liverpool defence just hoofing it out, losing possession
18/4/24, 10:59 pm - Dave: Stressed and rattled
18/4/24, 11:00 pm - Jono: Merson reckons the PL is too intense therefore England teams suffer in europe
18/4/24, 11:00 pm - Jono: Or maybe the PL IS the true Farmers league?
18/4/24, 11:00 pm - Dave: I think foreign leagues are just more technical. English teams got found out
18/4/24, 11:01 pm - Dave: Premier league arrogance got to our heads
18/4/24, 11:16 pm - Gerrard: Fuck yeah Liverpool won!
Eat shit guys!
18/4/24, 11:27 pm - James: You're both just not as good as you thought you were
18/4/24, 11:33 pm - Gerrard: Deflect what, we fucking won a game sucka
18/4/24, 11:35 pm - Gerrard: I think Curly is broken
18/4/24, 11:35 pm - Dave: Karabao Klapp strikes again
18/4/24, 11:37 pm - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4YGhNgITx8/?igsh=MTltZ2Z1djEwcGUyZw==
Deflect this Curly

18/4/24, 11:47 pm - Liam: Nice win! 🎉 well done boys
18/4/24, 11:48 pm - Dave: Fair play. Bigger man. You’re right, I shouldn’t be so negative. They did just win a game. I’m sorry @61409710717, @61404060785. Congrats on the big win 👊👏
18/4/24, 11:51 pm - Gerrard: Thank you, finally some civility

19/4/24, 12:22 am - Gerrard: Won more games than Arsenal this week 👏🏻
19/4/24, 12:26 am - Dave: Take the wins when you can 👏💪👊
19/4/24, 1:18 am - James: Can't be getting knocked out by atalanta
19/4/24, 1:19 am - James: Thought it was going to be a hectic final in Dublin full of scouse?
19/4/24, 1:23 am - Pero: Livo couldn't score in open play over 2 legs with kolasinac in defence an ancient arsenal reject
19/4/24, 1:23 am - Pero: Take the win though
19/4/24, 1:24 am - Pero: All in for PL now !! Let's make sure city don't win
19/4/24, 1:42 am - James: Wow
19/4/24, 2:56 am - Gerrard: Certain can and did!
19/4/24, 2:57 am - Gerrard: Would've been good craic
19/4/24, 2:57 am - Gerrard: Told you, this whole season is just bad finishing
19/4/24, 3:14 am - James: Scammacca did the damage
19/4/24, 3:14 am - James: West Ham reject
19/4/24, 3:14 am - James: Antonio is better than him...
19/4/24, 3:15 am - Pero: Just bad finished ? 3 goals conceded at home and could have been more away
19/4/24, 3:16 am - Gerrard: Yes
19/4/24, 3:20 am - James: Atlanta had so many chances first leg
19/4/24, 3:20 am - James: Could have been 5
19/4/24, 3:21 am - James: Defence was all at sea
19/4/24, 3:31 am - Gerrard: How dare they let them have 7 shots on, disgraceful
19/4/24, 3:32 am - Gerrard: Imagine Nunez was a striker, we'd been 8pts clear..... Such is life...
19/4/24, 3:37 am - Dave: I thought Nunez was a great signing and “Liverpool have the best attack in the league”
19/4/24, 3:37 am - Dave: Weren’t you all posting screenshots of darwizzys stats in here all season. Suddenly the poor cunt is hung out to dry
19/4/24, 3:38 am - James: Wow wow wow
19/4/24, 3:43 am - Dave: Correct or incorrect?
19/4/24, 3:44 am - James: Ten Hag is shit but klacks last season will be the same as his first?
19/4/24, 3:45 am - James: Isak isn't as good apparently
19/4/24, 3:46 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 need him to be world class, not just better than Arsenal and Newtle strikers
19/4/24, 3:46 am - Gerrard: No room for error at the top
19/4/24, 3:47 am - Dave: I mean, Nunez is better than Jesus and Eddie. I’ll give you that. Can’t speak for newtles strikers, @61452662705 ?
19/4/24, 3:47 am - Gerrard: If you'd been at a real title race ever you'd know @14244893404
19/4/24, 3:48 am - Gerrard: Saka Martinelli Havertz Trossard
19/4/24, 3:50 am - James: Such a fraud
19/4/24, 3:50 am - James: Ten years 😂
19/4/24, 3:51 am - Dave: I’ve witnessed my team in more title races and win more titles than you in our lifetimes pal. Hate to pop your bubble
19/4/24, 3:51 am - James: That's actually true lol
19/4/24, 3:52 am - Gerrard: If he's a fraud then look out for your mates then
19/4/24, 3:52 am - Gerrard: Fantasy talk again
19/4/24, 3:52 am - Dave: Almighty confident for one title in 35 years aren’t they @61452662705 <This message was edited>
19/4/24, 3:52 am - Gerrard: Almost?
19/4/24, 3:52 am - Dave: Thought you’d be able to count if you can code
19/4/24, 3:52 am - Gerrard: All so?
19/4/24, 3:52 am - Gerrard: Code like a secret?
19/4/24, 3:53 am - Dave: So tired
19/4/24, 3:53 am - Dave: Facts only. Got caught chatting shit again didn’t you laddy
19/4/24, 3:54 am - Gerrard: I thought we're not allowed to look back more than a year
19/4/24, 3:54 am - Gerrard: These damn rules keep changing 🤷🏼‍♂️
19/4/24, 4:02 am - Dave: Fair enough. So is third place in more of a title race than second place? 

About to post that meth pipe meme again
19/4/24, 4:04 am - Gerrard: Do Liverpool have 19 titles or have Arsenal always been a shite team?
I can't keep track of all these rules
19/4/24, 4:13 am - Dave: Back to living in that sweet sweet past. Looking forward to another 30 years of this 🙏
19/4/24, 4:15 am - Gerrard: I'm loving the now, Worst Liverpool team ever = Best Arsenal team ever?
19/4/24, 4:17 am - Dave: This Liverpool squad is worst Liverpool team ever?
19/4/24, 4:18 am - Gerrard: I'm going by your logic
19/4/24, 4:18 am - Gerrard: I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH ALL THESE RULES AND FACTS CHANGING
19/4/24, 4:18 am - Gerrard: You're just impossible to talk to bro
19/4/24, 4:23 am - Dave: Facts don’t change bro
19/4/24, 4:24 am - Gerrard: You said Arteta is world class though
19/4/24, 4:24 am - Dave: Not thinking straight because you’re so upset. Take a breather, go touch grass. Fulham away next
19/4/24, 4:25 am - Gerrard: I'm so rattled that I can't focus on my job <This message was edited>
19/4/24, 4:26 am - Gerrard: Gonna go stick my head in the oven <This message was edited>

19/4/24, 7:24 am - James: Collective umble
19/4/24, 7:25 am - James: Euros to come then a new season of disappointment and self discovery
19/4/24, 7:25 am - James: Or discovery followed by disappointment
19/4/24, 7:49 am - Dave: Euros won’t even be a humble, don’t expect shit from England this tournament with Southgate
19/4/24, 8:19 am - Gerrard: Humble week?
19/4/24, 9:37 am - James: Humble
19/4/24, 9:42 am - Shaun: Gerard only know bumble

19/4/24, 10:00 pm - Dave: Now you understand how everyone felt about Liverpool fans for 30 years until cult hero Klapp showed up. 

Unfortunately comes with the territory being a big club, that is historically successful and hasn’t tasted success at the top level for a substantial amount of time. We’ll get there, onwards and upwards 💪👊 🔴 ⚪️

21/4/24, 5:00 am - Liam: Nice try gez, 2 weeks ago you were still in the fa cup, Europa and top of the league
21/4/24, 5:00 am - Gerrard: Nice try Larry, the memes were always there
21/4/24, 5:01 am - Liam: Nice try gez, but now it’s funny, because it is reality.
21/4/24, 5:02 am - Gerrard: Nice try Larry, you shouldn't take joy at other's sadness as it will darken your heart

21/4/24, 10:28 am - Pero: Just off the top of my head torres and Suarez went on to win CL after leaving livo
21/4/24, 10:34 am - Gerrard: Yeah and Henderson, Traore, Riise, Carragher, Moreno, Lallana, Brewster, Biscan, Josemi all WON a CL while at Liverpool.
Go figure!
21/4/24, 11:04 am - Pero: I thought the topic was about players transferring onto other clubs to win CL. I'm confused
21/4/24, 11:19 am - Liam: @61422023136 is geza changing topics again?

22/4/24, 1:46 am - Gerrard: Good or bad thing to make a fa cup final against City???
This could be worse than last year.
22/4/24, 1:47 am - Gerrard: I may get a GoPro and record all the reactions at Scruffy's this time.
Some of my dearest memories.
22/4/24, 1:48 am - Gerrard: Looking into the eyes of a diehard United fan after a 1min goal - priceless.
22/4/24, 1:52 am - Louie: Our only hope is if the FA find them guilty of the 115 charges and send them to non-league before the final 🤞
22/4/24, 2:04 am - Liam: Had a great game
22/4/24, 2:56 am - Dave: What a game, dier done himself proud

22/4/24, 6:07 am - James: What are they doing in a final 😂
22/4/24, 6:08 am - James: Anyone see Anthony cup his ears at the Coventry players?
22/4/24, 6:08 am - James: Their goal wasn't offside either
22/4/24, 6:37 am - Dave: Did you see the video of the cat that predicts results? It predicted Coventry to win that game 😂😂. So close, can’t believe that last Coventry goal was offside
22/4/24, 6:37 am - Dave: By a bees dick
22/4/24, 6:38 am - Dave: No. But that’s shameful. And something that rat faced prick would absolutely do
22/4/24, 6:45 am - Gerrard: Wot a kunt
22/4/24, 6:59 am - James: Tiny dick energy
22/4/24, 6:59 am - James: 2 goals 1 assist this season
22/4/24, 6:59 am - James: Maguire was a gentleman tbf
22/4/24, 7:07 am - Dave: Antony alone probably cost 2-3X that entire Coventry squad lol
22/4/24, 7:08 am - Dave: Just English culture hey lads, we’re gents ❤️

23/4/24, 1:59 am - Dave: Totally agree with this. Another winger or two should be one of Arsenal’s top priorities
23/4/24, 1:59 am - Gerrard: Top priority should be a manager
23/4/24, 1:59 am - Dave: Saka is fucked. Martinelli has looked shite the last few games as well, totally off the boil <This message was edited>
23/4/24, 1:59 am - Dave: Trossard keeping us in it

23/4/24, 2:38 am - Gerrard: Rory was backing your boy in that, don't know why you're upset
23/4/24, 2:38 am - Gerrard: Sorry, "star"boy
23/4/24, 2:47 am - Liam: Hey @14244893404 what’s bottle job mouthing off about this morning?
23/4/24, 3:05 am - Gerrard: Wow, really trying to shake off the bottle job designation
23/4/24, 3:29 am - Dave: So you didn’t bottle three trophies this season?
23/4/24, 3:30 am - Dave: I can’t stand that Rory. Yappy little dog
23/4/24, 3:30 am - Gerrard: Nope just got knocked out of two and won one, still in the race for the title
23/4/24, 3:31 am - Gerrard: There's an art to bottling as you well know
23/4/24, 3:31 am - Dave: You hear that @61478754484 @61422023136 ? We just got knocked out of the title race last year!!!
23/4/24, 3:31 am - Dave: The term bottle has been redefined by Liverpool fans now.
23/4/24, 3:31 am - Dave: 🙌
23/4/24, 3:33 am - Gerrard: Oh sweetie, if you don't want to think you're bottle jobs then don't - I back your mental well being ❤️
23/4/24, 3:47 am - Pero: Knocked out by 5 pts last year, it was that loss to city and that draw against West ham
23/4/24, 3:48 am - Pero: Not unrealistic to drop points in those fixtures
23/4/24, 3:55 am - Gerrard: What about the year before with the top4 bottle?
23/4/24, 4:24 am - Jono: I'm hearing too many Mourinho rumours
23/4/24, 4:27 am - Gerrard: Just imagine 💦
23/4/24, 4:27 am - Gerrard: The press conferences 💦
23/4/24, 4:28 am - Gerrard: The gestures to United fans 💦
23/4/24, 4:28 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 you be upset if we take your boy?
23/4/24, 4:57 am - Dave: Hang on, so you’re happy or sad about mourinho to Liverpool?
23/4/24, 4:58 am - Jono: I have no idea 😅
23/4/24, 4:59 am - Pero: If jose goes to livo, give it 2 or 3 weeks jono you'll jump on board the Jose train
23/4/24, 5:00 am - Liam: Jose won’t quit on you 🎉
23/4/24, 5:01 am - Pero: He might get sacked but he ain't a quiter
23/4/24, 5:02 am - Dave: Jose is loyal unlike others
23/4/24, 5:41 am - Gerrard: I love Jose and I have no idea who'd be good after Klopp
23/4/24, 5:41 am - Gerrard: All managers are subpar compared to him....
23/4/24, 6:04 am - Jono: The only positive to me is he hates Man U's guts so would do everything in his power to fuck them which would make me happy irrespective of how we're playing (i.e. pumped them 7-nil last year + finished 5th)
23/4/24, 6:05 am - James: Doesn't get tired
23/4/24, 6:05 am - James: And a serial winner
23/4/24, 6:05 am - James: Big step up from klasp
23/4/24, 6:08 am - Dave: I’m actually a lot more concerned about Liverpool under mourinho than Klopp
23/4/24, 6:09 am - Dave: Mourinho is a different level
23/4/24, 6:09 am - Dave: He’s solidly in top 5 prem managers of all time for me

23/4/24, 5:39 pm - Dave: You been robbed brew

23/4/24, 10:40 pm - Dave: Benny blanco worldy
23/4/24, 10:40 pm - Dave: Post, nearly 6. Pants down
23/4/24, 10:46 pm - Jono: Glad I slotted spray tan in my FPL team this week
24/4/24, 1:00 am - Pero: Best morning ever !!  I'd rather beat chelsea 5-0 then win the carabao cup. Chelsea can go fuck themselves

24/4/24, 1:30 am - Gerrard: Whoa what's this lashing out?
I was complimenting your win
24/4/24, 1:31 am - Dave: No you weren’t. We see through your games bottler
24/4/24, 1:31 am - Gerrard: Wow somebody woke up on the wrong side of a mass shooting today
24/4/24, 1:33 am - Dave: That’s horse shit, we beat them 5-1 at Stamford bridge
24/4/24, 1:34 am - Dave: Actually wild how badly they capitulated. I didn’t realise they were still that bad, I was thinking it would be closer after that 6-0 win against Everton. Talk about highs and lows
24/4/24, 1:34 am - Gerrard: 2nd goal was in the second half right?
24/4/24, 1:34 am - Gerrard: United and Chelsea are hilarious
24/4/24, 1:35 am - Gerrard: You see that Flex guy going off?
24/4/24, 1:35 am - Dave: They were bad in first half as well though. Put it this way, I was fuming that we weren’t 3 or 4 up by half time.
24/4/24, 1:35 am - Gerrard: No pleasing some people
24/4/24, 1:36 am - Dave: Nice easy game for you lads tomorrow
24/4/24, 1:37 am - Dave: Crazy high tight it is still, best season in years
24/4/24, 1:38 am - Gerrard: Shit season, Liverpool have been shocking this year
24/4/24, 1:38 am - Gerrard: Just because three teams are having bad seasons doesn't make this a good season
24/4/24, 1:39 am - Gerrard: Sorry, I mean City and Liverpool are having bad seasons and Arsenal are having their best.
24/4/24, 1:43 am - Dave: Huh? You were winning the quadruple 3 weeks ago? Fuck me the state of you fans
24/4/24, 1:45 am - Pero: Hektik season ! Very tense few weeks coming up
24/4/24, 1:47 am - Gerrard: To be equal with Arsenal is a bad season (3pts la la la, you know what I mean)
24/4/24, 1:47 am - Pero: We were smoking them in every department. Funny when the commentary was describing chelsea starting line up "$220m midfield with Enzo and caicedo". Wow what a piece of shit team they are
24/4/24, 1:49 am - Gerrard: https://www.facebook.com/share/v/4upiPbygZQkGS4ho/?mibextid=0VwfS7
24/4/24, 1:49 am - Gerrard: Via Pero
24/4/24, 1:54 am - Dave: Todd just needs to hijack more signings and spend more money. He’ll get there in the end. Sack poch as well. Bring mourinho back - he’ll probably try hijacking that now he’s heard Liverpool want him
24/4/24, 1:54 am - Dave: Didn’t know there was a difference. Been calling lads “big boy” for years
24/4/24, 1:56 am - Jono: Feel like we or Man City need to lose a few hours prior to make them slip
24/4/24, 1:57 am - Gerrard: Like 'cum on my face big boy'?
24/4/24, 1:57 am - Jono: Horrific season from both
24/4/24, 2:01 am - Pero: That nikolas jackson is worse then that terrible duo
24/4/24, 2:01 am - Jono: Anyone watched Baby Reindeer yet on Netflix btw.... fucking trippy man. Worth a watch if you love a good stalker tale
24/4/24, 2:02 am - Jono: Makes Nunez look like R9
24/4/24, 2:19 am - Dave: I’m on episode 6. So good isn’t it. Didn’t realise it was about his own life until last night
24/4/24, 2:21 am - Jono: Yeah same after 5 eps realised its his own tale. Someone's outed the real chick on Twitter via digging up old tweets which has caused mayhem as he was doing all he could to conceal her identity
24/4/24, 2:22 am - Dave: Lovely little bit of irony at play isn’t there… stalker becomes stalked 🤣🤣

fa cup - united 
Europa - Atalanta 
PL - Everton
25/4/24, 12:34 am - James: Morning. Didn't watch the game. Had a much needed sleep in. Palace are on fire at the moment. Well done them
25/4/24, 12:34 am - James: But
25/4/24, 12:34 am - James: BUT
25/4/24, 12:34 am - James: What happened to Varpool?
25/4/24, 12:34 am - James: 😂
25/4/24, 12:35 am - James: This klappa farewell has been some ride this last few weeks
25/4/24, 12:36 am - James: Truth in it. They aren't as good as they think they are
25/4/24, 12:36 am - ~ Dave changed this group's icon
25/4/24, 12:36 am - James: So many times this season they've been wank and somehow managed not to be out of the game by half time
25/4/24, 12:36 am - ~ Dave changed this group's icon
25/4/24, 12:37 am - James: They have £50m attackers on the bench that gets them out of trouble
25/4/24, 12:37 am - James: But as a team, they aren't as good as citeh and varsenal
25/4/24, 12:37 am - Dave: Best part was watching Trent hide his face on the bench. Clearly remembering the “we’re winning the quadruple” interview he had 4 weeks ago
25/4/24, 12:38 am - James: They'll finish 3rd, with a karabo boo boo kup
25/4/24, 12:38 am - James: And a few fist pumps
25/4/24, 12:38 am - James: They go quiet now
25/4/24, 12:39 am - James: Too loud and arrogant
25/4/24, 12:39 am - Dave: Was it Barnes or jones who was crying in an interview that arteta was stealing Klopp’s celebrations the other day?
25/4/24, 12:39 am - Dave: Found out
25/4/24, 12:40 am - Liam: @14244893404 our participation in the community Shield, is basically all but confirmed. <This message was edited>
25/4/24, 12:40 am - James: Imagine getting your coffin nailed by Man Utd and Everton 😂
25/4/24, 12:41 am - James: Your two biggest enemies who are both shit
25/4/24, 12:45 am - James: Two Evertonian lads scoring the goals too
25/4/24, 12:46 am - James: I thought when Varpool got some of their players back they'd be unstoppable?
25/4/24, 12:52 am - Dave: They’ve looked shite ever since Salah came back
25/4/24, 1:21 am - Liam: Ouch
25/4/24, 1:23 am - James: Lost his last ever Merseyside derby
25/4/24, 1:44 am - Dave: Legacy. “Above Wenger”
25/4/24, 2:17 am - Pero: I actually felt a bit sorry for him watching his post match interview. He looked completely distraught. Like he has given up
25/4/24, 2:24 am - James: Tired
25/4/24, 2:29 am - Dave: Trent promised him a quad. Nail in coffin today. Can’t even blame the Saudi oil money this time, because Arsenal will finish above them again. Legacy left in tatters.
25/4/24, 2:41 am - James: Funny, was it Citehs fault today?
25/4/24, 2:45 am - Gerrard: Not catching up on all those messages but I'll say, wheels - off
25/4/24, 2:46 am - Gerrard: It ends with a whimper
25/4/24, 2:47 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6Gz2BWInB_/?igsh=eWo3Z2tnNHFhNnF3
25/4/24, 2:48 am - Pero: Indeed legacy has been heavily impacted
25/4/24, 2:48 am - Pero: 😂😂 very good
25/4/24, 2:51 am - Liam: What legacy
25/4/24, 2:51 am - Gerrard: Can't let Everton fans be happy, diiiiiisgrace
25/4/24, 2:53 am - Gerrard: I blame @61404060785, probably jinxed us at some point
25/4/24, 2:54 am - James: Yeah what legacy?
25/4/24, 2:54 am - James: Arne Slot is nailed on now 😂
25/4/24, 2:54 am - James: Oh come on 😂
25/4/24, 2:54 am - Dave: Ten hags brother
25/4/24, 2:54 am - James: Always someone else's fault
25/4/24, 2:54 am - James: Like women
25/4/24, 2:55 am - James: Scousers are all women
25/4/24, 2:55 am - Dave: Oh it’s been gold on Twitter today. Lfc fans truly turned on Klapp
25/4/24, 2:55 am - James: Not good enough
25/4/24, 2:55 am - James: That slob is shit
25/4/24, 2:55 am - Gerrard: I haven't
25/4/24, 2:55 am - Gerrard: Will always love him
25/4/24, 2:55 am - James: 5 g/a all season
25/4/24, 2:56 am - Gerrard: Will always hate you @14244893404
25/4/24, 2:56 am - James: Klanpt is a dinosaur
25/4/24, 2:56 am - James: Surpassed without ever going down as one of the greats
25/4/24, 2:57 am - James: Oh Varpool are a bottle
25/4/24, 2:57 am - James: They stole it from Varsenal. Typical theiving scousers
25/4/24, 2:57 am - James: 100%
25/4/24, 2:57 am - James: Looked good for a month
25/4/24, 2:58 am - James: Typical bundesliga player
25/4/24, 2:58 am - Dave: Bottlepool. Capitulation of the century
25/4/24, 2:58 am - James: £70m @14244893404
25/4/24, 2:58 am - Gerrard: You guys are so full of hate, blacken your hearts
25/4/24, 2:58 am - Dave: PFA
25/4/24, 2:58 am - James: Diaz is shit as well
25/4/24, 2:58 am - Dave: “Mark my words”
25/4/24, 2:58 am - Gerrard: Let Arsenal cook
25/4/24, 2:59 am - James: Diaz output for three seasons is shit lol
25/4/24, 2:59 am - Dave: Diaz is a donkey as well yeah
25/4/24, 2:59 am - James: Without Salah and Alisson
25/4/24, 2:59 am - Dave: Only one that can score now is jota. And he’s made of glass
25/4/24, 2:59 am - James: They'd be 6-7th
25/4/24, 2:59 am - James: I like Jota
25/4/24, 2:59 am - Dave: Salah looks like he’s got one foot out the door, already collecting his 7m a week in Saudi
25/4/24, 2:59 am - James: He's a fanny though
25/4/24, 3:00 am - James: Weak and a diver
25/4/24, 3:00 am - Dave: Like I said, he can score but he’s made of glass. And yes, a diver
25/4/24, 3:00 am - James: Trent hungry this morning? <This message was edited>
25/4/24, 3:01 am - Dave: Only thing Trent hungry for is a cheeseburger
25/4/24, 3:01 am - James: Cheesy scouse chips
25/4/24, 3:01 am - Dave: Couldn’t hit a barn door today
25/4/24, 3:01 am - Dave: Supposedly better than KDB
25/4/24, 3:01 am - Gerrard: I'm gonna watch the.... 3.... minute.... highlights.... 😁
25/4/24, 3:01 am - James: Calvert Lewin scored
25/4/24, 3:01 am - James: Thought he was dead
25/4/24, 3:01 am - Dave: Sums it up
25/4/24, 3:01 am - James: Got dyched
25/4/24, 3:01 am - James: Dyche ball
25/4/24, 3:02 am - James: We salute you sir 🫡
25/4/24, 3:02 am - James: Dyche doing a stunner on klasps
25/4/24, 3:02 am - Dave: Best part was, he went for the jugular
25/4/24, 3:03 am - Dave: Wasn’t even dyche ball. Not a smash and grab park the bus situation
25/4/24, 3:03 am - Dave: Everton outplayed them. Could have been 3 or 4 easy
25/4/24, 3:03 am - Gerrard: What a fuck up on the first goal
25/4/24, 3:03 am - Dave: This the team that got absolutely smashed by Chelsea last week 6-0
25/4/24, 3:04 am - Dave: The same Chelsea that jezzy was mocking odegaard for playing well against
25/4/24, 3:04 am - James: The two comments there are true. I wanted him for us but didn't see where he'd play. Same as maddison. If you play a 4-3-3 he can't fit in both vapry and us
25/4/24, 3:04 am - James: He is a number 10 of left wide attacker
25/4/24, 3:04 am - James: Not an 8
25/4/24, 3:04 am - Gerrard: Klopp got punished for not sticking with the 2nd string boys who played well against Fulham <This message was edited>
25/4/24, 3:05 am - Dave: Not sure what Klapp is doing with him tbh. Not getting the best out of him for sure
25/4/24, 3:05 am - Gerrard: Should start Elliot every game
25/4/24, 3:05 am - Gerrard: Can't let Everton fans be happy

25/4/24, 3:06 am - James: I'll call it now like jonos POTY prediction
25/4/24, 3:06 am - James: They'll be a slot of 'varpools title charge terminated'
25/4/24, 3:06 am - Gerrard: I want to records checked for more jinxes
25/4/24, 3:06 am - James: Slot of terminator usages
25/4/24, 3:07 am - Gerrard: *to see the records
25/4/24, 3:10 am - Gerrard: Why haven't we talked about Newtle yet?

25/4/24, 3:14 am - Gerrard: I wasn't awake, go again please

25/4/24, 3:16 am - James: The receipts are there to be handed back...
25/4/24, 3:16 am - Gerrard: At you or Liverpool?
25/4/24, 3:16 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I said please
25/4/24, 3:17 am - James: I have no dog in the race. I'm just the guy who walks inbetween the two houses and pokes the wasps nest and fucks off as fast as I can
25/4/24, 3:17 am - Gerrard: They don't want to chuck a @61404060785 and jinx their team
25/4/24, 3:18 am - James: Nunnni is shit
25/4/24, 3:18 am - Gerrard: I think you think too highly of yourself, just a tool for us to use when needed
25/4/24, 3:19 am - James: Me thinks someone is a grumpy boy this moaning
25/4/24, 3:19 am - James: Lashing out
25/4/24, 3:19 am - Liam: LIVERPOOL ARE FUCKING SHIT
25/4/24, 3:19 am - James: Can't be losing to Everton

25/4/24, 3:19 am - James: Jono gone awol
25/4/24, 3:20 am - Gerrard: He messaged on the other chat
25/4/24, 3:21 am - Dave: Honestly. I was slightly ashamed at how happy I was after seeing Liverpool get destroyed at goodison today. I never minded Liverpool until the years of Arsenal abuse  🤷‍♂️
25/4/24, 3:21 am - Gerrard: Don't blame others for the hate in your heart, it's all in your control bud
25/4/24, 3:21 am - Liam: Not hate, just facts
25/4/24, 3:22 am - Dave: You only invited us here to bully James. We didn’t conform so you turned on Liam and I 😢
25/4/24, 3:22 am - Gerrard: I never thought you'd be like them, always singing YNWA with me
25/4/24, 3:23 am - Gerrard: I hated Arsenal long before I met you guys
25/4/24, 3:23 am - Gerrard: And will long after I'm no longer friends with youse
25/4/24, 3:24 am - Dave: https://x.com/joelfc94/status/1783220967235309846?s=48&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA

25/4/24, 3:32 am - James: Explains the drop of form since April
25/4/24, 3:38 am - Gerrard: Weak, Newty
25/4/24, 3:42 am - James: Like the Varpool team
25/4/24, 3:42 am - James: Couldn't breathe 😪
25/4/24, 3:42 am - James: No half time pick me ups
25/4/24, 7:21 am - Gerrard: Blackened heart
25/4/24, 7:21 am - Gerrard: Can't believe you don't wish the best for a good bloke like him
25/4/24, 8:04 am - James: Ask Karius
25/4/24, 8:04 am - Dave: All a farce isn’t it
25/4/24, 8:04 am - Dave: Never seen a fan base turn so quickly
25/4/24, 8:06 am - Pero: Honestly so quickly they are throwing daggers in and turning the handle
25/4/24, 8:08 am - Pero: He saying everton were fouling all game whilst livo had most of the ball. Then at the end just admitted livo were just not good enough
25/4/24, 8:08 am - Pero: Still mathematically a title race . How can you give up now

25/4/24, 8:25 am - Pero: 💯 all those years of hard work at anfield and seems like the fans are dumping the club in a matter of weeks
25/4/24, 8:25 am - Gerrard: Anthony, don't be like the English
25/4/24, 8:25 am - Gerrard: You're a real human
25/4/24, 8:28 am - Gerrard: Going for a massage now, I hope you see a much friendlier group chat when I get out.
25/4/24, 8:29 am - Dave: Almost like the Arsenal fans are rebounding from a solid year of abuse 🫡
25/4/24, 8:29 am - Dave: Be friendlier to Klopp and nuny. Poor blokes need you
25/4/24, 8:30 am - Pero: 2 weeks ago the title was "over" for us and now we are 3 pts in the lead. All I'm saying is anything can happen
25/4/24, 8:30 am - Pero: Find the light bulb
25/4/24, 8:31 am - Pero: You make a good point @14244893404

25/4/24, 8:38 am - James: How the turns have tabled

25/4/24, 1:25 pm - James: You boys ever met a knight before?
25/4/24, 1:25 pm - James: An actual 'sir'
25/4/24, 1:26 pm - James: As Australians in this group...
25/4/24, 1:26 pm - James: Do you know this guy?
25/4/24, 1:33 pm - Pero: Looks like he has won a medal or two
25/4/24, 1:33 pm - Pero: Earned*
25/4/24, 3:00 pm - James: Think he's a peodo
25/4/24, 5:35 pm - Dave: Why’s he strapped?
25/4/24, 5:36 pm - Dave: Because they’re peddling fake news and everyone’s against Liverpool!!!!
25/4/24, 5:36 pm - James: Interesting this
25/4/24, 5:36 pm - Dave: Looks like he’s about to give the club a dose of freedom
25/4/24, 5:37 pm - James: https://www.9news.com.au/national/former-diplomat-accused-of-sexual-assault/8dec51e4-c075-4e67-8e64-d76bbe750b3e
25/4/24, 5:39 pm - James: I met a knight and peado on the same night
25/4/24, 5:39 pm - James: Turns out he was innocent
25/4/24, 5:40 pm - James: However, I googled him when he said he was a knight when he fucked off to get a drink
25/4/24, 5:40 pm - Dave: *had more money than the young lad than he assaulted?
25/4/24, 5:40 pm - Dave: Bunch of nonces
25/4/24, 5:40 pm - James: So I was like, shit, he's a sir

25/4/24, 5:41 pm - James: What a ride
25/4/24, 5:41 pm - Dave: Where did you meet him?
25/4/24, 5:41 pm - James: Some pub at the rocks tonight
25/4/24, 5:46 pm - Dave: Walks around pubs suited up telling randoms he’s a sir and touches children in his free time 🤨
25/4/24, 5:47 pm - James: Na, he actually is
25/4/24, 5:47 pm - Dave: Might as well stay up for the game brew
25/4/24, 5:47 pm - James: Anzac Day
25/4/24, 5:47 pm - James: He legit is a sir
25/4/24, 5:47 pm - Dave: But he’s a nonce, so he’s a sub human
25/4/24, 5:48 pm - James: He was found innocent
25/4/24, 5:48 pm - James: Apparently
25/4/24, 5:48 pm - James: Still a sir?
25/4/24, 5:48 pm - James: Sir Jimmy Saville
25/4/24, 5:52 pm - James: Aussie legend apparently
25/4/24, 5:52 pm - James: Hence my asking in the group

Must leave a sour taste in the poor blokes mouth after all he’s done for that club

26/4/24, 7:43 am - Gerrard: How dare they gender him
26/4/24, 8:00 am - Dave: I can understand that. You were pretty reliant on that illustrious pig bladder football, pre-war era history prior to Klapp
26/4/24, 8:05 am - Gerrard: The 80s so far away <This message was edited>
26/4/24, 8:10 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 just remember that the distance from Liverpool's 1990 title to Arsenal's last title is less than Arsenal's last title and now.

4/5/24, 12:10 am - Dave: I’d be fucking pumped with that signing. Never going to happen
4/5/24, 12:34 am - James: https://www.nowarsenal.com/transfer-news/newcastle-united-in-advanced-talks-to-sign-arsenal-winger/
4/5/24, 12:34 am - James: Never ever ever 🇸🇦
4/5/24, 12:35 am - James: Can we admit Isak is better than Nunez on here yet???
4/5/24, 12:37 am - Liam: Injuried a lot
4/5/24, 12:38 am - James: Never gets chance to recover because our other striker is always injured lol
4/5/24, 12:38 am - James: Isak walks into Varsenal and varpools teams
4/5/24, 12:38 am - James: You'd have both maybe won the league with him up top 🤷
4/5/24, 12:39 am - James: A fit Calum Wilson would have been a better striker than poonez and jesus 🙈
4/5/24, 12:44 am - Dave: Totally agree
4/5/24, 12:45 am - Dave: Agree again
4/5/24, 12:45 am - Dave: Newcastles strikers are better than both arsenals and Liverpools
4/5/24, 12:45 am - James: Gordon gets on your right flank this season too
4/5/24, 12:45 am - James: Left rather
4/5/24, 12:45 am - Dave: Shame the majority of the rest of the team is a bag of shit
4/5/24, 12:46 am - Dave: Agree. I’d have him over martinelli this season
4/5/24, 12:46 am - Dave: I really rate Gordon
4/5/24, 12:46 am - James: Gordon is better than Diaz as well
4/5/24, 12:46 am - Dave: I wouldn’t take any other Newcastle players for starters.
4/5/24, 12:46 am - James: Diaz numbers are shocking
4/5/24, 12:47 am - James: Three seasons now
4/5/24, 12:47 am - Dave: I’d take Joelinton, Bruno and trippier
4/5/24, 12:47 am - Dave: Maybe schar as well for bench
4/5/24, 12:47 am - James: Livramento
4/5/24, 12:47 am - James: He's going to be right back for England for years
4/5/24, 12:47 am - Dave: Don’t see how he gets in
4/5/24, 12:47 am - James: He will
4/5/24, 12:47 am - Dave: He’s competing with white and tomi at Arsenal
4/5/24, 12:48 am - James: He's only 20
4/5/24, 12:48 am - Dave: Wouldn’t get in our squad. But he’s a decent player
4/5/24, 12:48 am - James: Another one out for the season
4/5/24, 12:48 am - Dave: Donkey. When he does anything, it looks chaotic and messy
4/5/24, 12:49 am - Dave: Like a fluke
4/5/24, 12:49 am - James: 5 goals a season
4/5/24, 12:49 am - James: Fuck all assists
4/5/24, 12:50 am - James: If you signed Guimares he would start in your team 100%
4/5/24, 12:50 am - Dave: He wouldn’t
4/5/24, 12:50 am - Dave: Who’s he getting in over
4/5/24, 12:51 am - James: He definitely would as an 8
4/5/24, 12:51 am - Dave: He’s a liability as well, wouldn’t suit arteta. Too much of a hot head
4/5/24, 12:51 am - Dave: He’d get carded every week if he played for us
4/5/24, 12:51 am - James: 9 yellows 0 reds
4/5/24, 12:51 am - James: Hasn't been carded since last year
4/5/24, 12:51 am - Dave: Yeah change them to reds and add 10 yellows if he was wearing an Arsenal shirt
4/5/24, 12:52 am - James: He was one card away from a two match ban
4/5/24, 12:52 am - Dave: Don’t get away with murder like you oil boys lol
4/5/24, 12:52 am - James: And he said 'don't worry boss I won't get a card'
4/5/24, 12:52 am - Liam: I’d take him
4/5/24, 12:52 am - James: And hasn't for four months
4/5/24, 12:52 am - Dave: I said I’d take him on bench
4/5/24, 12:52 am - Liam: Replace Partey
4/5/24, 12:52 am - Dave: Would you start him @61478754484 ?
4/5/24, 12:52 am - Liam: Pivot with rice
4/5/24, 12:52 am - Dave: 100%
4/5/24, 12:52 am - Liam: Be unreal
4/5/24, 12:52 am - Liam: I’d take Isak
4/5/24, 12:53 am - Dave: Exactly. But you wouldn’t start him unless rice was off the boil
4/5/24, 12:53 am - Liam: But injury concerns me
4/5/24, 12:53 am - Dave: Excuse the pun
4/5/24, 12:53 am - Liam: I would start rice and him
4/5/24, 12:53 am - Liam: Both playing the 6 and 8
4/5/24, 12:53 am - Liam: Switching it up in game
4/5/24, 12:53 am - James: He'll be sent off tonight now I've said all that
4/5/24, 12:54 am - James: Going on sports bet now
4/5/24, 12:54 am - Liam: Newy selling players what’s going on?
4/5/24, 12:54 am - Liam: Why this topic
4/5/24, 12:54 am - Liam: Surely not selling those 2
4/5/24, 12:54 am - James: Selling nobody
4/5/24, 12:54 am - James: Maybe almiron
4/5/24, 12:54 am - Liam: Sell anyone but them
4/5/24, 12:54 am - Liam: And Gordon
4/5/24, 12:54 am - James: Wilson, almiron
4/5/24, 12:54 am - Liam: Keep Gordon*
4/5/24, 12:55 am - James: He is going to win us the euros
4/5/24, 12:55 am - Dave: Selling Isak…
4/5/24, 12:55 am - Dave: To us
4/5/24, 12:55 am - James: Travesty if Southgate doesn't start gordon
4/5/24, 12:55 am - Liam: The rest of them can fuck off tho
4/5/24, 12:55 am - Liam: I wouldn’t do this deal
4/5/24, 12:55 am - Liam: Injuries
4/5/24, 12:55 am - James: Varsenal will sign Toney
4/5/24, 12:55 am - James: Or solanke
4/5/24, 12:55 am - Dave: You see the article Jono sent earlier @61478754484
4/5/24, 12:55 am - Dave: Independent
4/5/24, 12:55 am - Dave: Must be true
4/5/24, 12:55 am - Liam: Bruno I would
4/5/24, 12:56 am - James: Miguel Delaney
4/5/24, 12:56 am - Dave: Isak and Havertz I’d be happy with that
4/5/24, 12:56 am - James: Anti Saudi unless it's for his club manure
4/5/24, 12:56 am - Dave: Get rid of Eddie and Jesus
4/5/24, 12:56 am - Liam: Not true unless I hear it from Mark goulbridge
4/5/24, 12:56 am - James: To who
4/5/24, 12:56 am - Dave: Give us another young lad
4/5/24, 12:56 am - James: You won't get any money
4/5/24, 12:56 am - Dave: To work into the position. Wild card
4/5/24, 12:56 am - Liam: Get rid of Eddie, Jesus I would keep but bench and sell next year
4/5/24, 12:56 am - Dave: What you smoking
4/5/24, 12:57 am - James: We're taking a star boy from your academy
4/5/24, 12:57 am - Dave: Eddie we’d get at least 30m for him
4/5/24, 12:57 am - James: That's real
4/5/24, 12:57 am - Liam: I don’t want too much movement in the summer
4/5/24, 12:57 am - Dave: English striker
4/5/24, 12:57 am - Dave: Will fit in well at a small club
4/5/24, 12:57 am - Dave: Jesus we’d get 50m+
4/5/24, 12:57 am - Liam: West ham
4/5/24, 12:57 am - James: No
4/5/24, 12:57 am - Dave: He’s a great player, just doesn’t fit into our system
4/5/24, 12:58 am - Pero: Isak would be epic and most value to what gunners need
4/5/24, 12:58 am - James: Antonio is better
4/5/24, 12:58 am - Dave: You mean you wouldn’t pay 30 for him. A lot of clubs would
4/5/24, 12:58 am - Dave: West ham wanted him for 40 I think
4/5/24, 12:58 am - Dave: But Arsenal wanted 45
4/5/24, 12:58 am - James: Isak would cost £130m
4/5/24, 12:58 am - Liam: Christ
4/5/24, 12:58 am - James: And he's signed a new contract
4/5/24, 12:58 am - Liam: I wouldn’t do that deal
4/5/24, 12:58 am - James: About to be announced
4/5/24, 12:59 am - Pero: 130 is too much
4/5/24, 12:59 am - Liam: Injuries
4/5/24, 12:59 am - Liam: I don’t want another Partey
4/5/24, 12:59 am - James: https://youtu.be/gU5ld20qAck?feature=shared
4/5/24, 12:59 am - Dave: 130 way too much fuck that
4/5/24, 12:59 am - James: https://youtu.be/T763ReQFvH8?feature=shared
4/5/24, 12:59 am - James: Insane baller
4/5/24, 1:00 am - Dave: He’s injury prone
4/5/24, 1:00 am - James: He wasn't
4/5/24, 1:00 am - James: As I said, it's because Wilson is
4/5/24, 1:00 am - James: And he doesn't get chance to recover
4/5/24, 1:00 am - Dave: I’d be pissed if they paid more than 70/80 for him
4/5/24, 1:01 am - James: We spent £70m
4/5/24, 1:01 am - Liam: What does this mean
4/5/24, 1:01 am - Liam: I need the cunt to play 40+ games a year
4/5/24, 1:01 am - Liam: Saka plays every minute
4/5/24, 1:02 am - James: Wilson is always injured. Isak played too many games at start of the season and ran into the ground
4/5/24, 1:02 am - Liam: Made of glass
4/5/24, 1:02 am - James: Gotta rotate these days. Too many games
4/5/24, 1:02 am - James: Wilson has to go
4/5/24, 1:02 am - Dave: Yeah, you’re desperate for the cash now though. Take what you can get FFP broke boys
4/5/24, 1:02 am - Liam: They broke
4/5/24, 1:02 am - James: Will bang in 15 goals next season for a Leicester or someone
4/5/24, 1:02 am - Liam: ?
4/5/24, 1:02 am - Liam: Thought they were rich
4/5/24, 1:02 am - Dave: Isak missed 26 games since 2023. Cunts made of glass
4/5/24, 1:03 am - James: New rules baby
4/5/24, 1:03 am - Dave: Rich on paper but broke in reality. Not allowed to spend more money
4/5/24, 1:03 am - Liam: 3/4 season
4/5/24, 1:03 am - James: Rich as fuck
4/5/24, 1:03 am - James: Richer than god
4/5/24, 1:03 am - Liam: This is so bad
4/5/24, 1:03 am - Dave: Newcastle have an aging, under par squad and need to replace them
4/5/24, 1:03 am - James: How many goals though
4/5/24, 1:03 am - Dave: So need cash injection
4/5/24, 1:03 am - Dave: Arsenal buy isak
4/5/24, 1:03 am - Liam: Who are made of glass
4/5/24, 1:03 am - James: Varsenal need to sell
4/5/24, 1:04 am - Dave: That’s 5 players for a team of Newcastles calibre
4/5/24, 1:04 am - Liam: Goals are good
4/5/24, 1:04 am - James: Varsenal over psr
4/5/24, 1:04 am - Dave: Isak = 5 Newcastle level players
4/5/24, 1:04 am - Liam: But 26 games
4/5/24, 1:04 am - Dave: Eddie and the club have no choice
4/5/24, 1:04 am - Liam: 78 points
4/5/24, 1:04 am - Dave: Shocking isn’t it
4/5/24, 1:04 am - Liam: Can be missing this
4/5/24, 1:04 am - Liam: I’m sure if he played for arsenal he would bang goals
4/5/24, 1:04 am - Dave: Imagine having star striker just bench warming for 26 games over 18 months
4/5/24, 1:04 am - James: Sound like Gez and Jono here you too
4/5/24, 1:05 am - James: Nooni is better
4/5/24, 1:05 am - Liam: Partey
4/5/24, 1:05 am - James: Nooni never misses games
4/5/24, 1:05 am - James: Just goals
4/5/24, 1:05 am - Liam: Plus
4/5/24, 1:05 am - Liam: If he would want high wages
4/5/24, 1:05 am - Liam: You can’t have 300k a week on the bench
4/5/24, 1:05 am - Liam: Or not even on the bench
4/5/24, 1:05 am - Liam: Injured
4/5/24, 1:06 am - James: Varsey should sell Martinelli. He's shite
4/5/24, 1:06 am - James: Trossard is old and looks like he's has aids
4/5/24, 1:06 am - Liam: Had a poor season. Give us 100m we would take it
4/5/24, 1:06 am - James: Tom Hanks philidelphia vibes
4/5/24, 1:06 am - Liam: Does look like he has aids
4/5/24, 1:06 am - Liam: Or cancer
4/5/24, 1:06 am - Dave: Martinelli needs to wake up or fuck offs, he’s looked shocking this season
4/5/24, 1:06 am - Liam: Doesn’t look healthy
4/5/24, 1:07 am - Dave: Trossard is an unbelievable player
4/5/24, 1:07 am - James: Declan Rice needs to fuck off his mrs
4/5/24, 1:07 am - Dave: He’s our best ball striker imo
4/5/24, 1:07 am - Dave: You’re just jealous
4/5/24, 1:07 am - James: Looks like a pig
4/5/24, 1:07 am - Liam: That left Side, it’s been chopped and changed a bit
4/5/24, 1:07 am - Liam: This season
4/5/24, 1:08 am - Liam: Got to take this into consideration when reviewing martinelli form
4/5/24, 1:08 am - James: Saka is burnt out
4/5/24, 1:08 am - James: Not a big game player either
4/5/24, 1:08 am - Liam: Not injuried tho
4/5/24, 1:08 am - James: Doesn't have the mentality
4/5/24, 1:09 am - Liam: Still banging numbers out
4/5/24, 1:09 am - James: He's no foden
4/5/24, 1:09 am - Liam: Can’t bang numbers out, if youre injured <This message was edited>

4/5/24, 1:10 am - Liam: Saw a stat the other day, saka registered a goal or an assist in the last 16 games against the big 6
4/5/24, 1:13 am - James: Must be true
4/5/24, 1:14 am - James: @61409710717 Saka turns up to important games?
4/5/24, 1:15 am - Gerrard: Never seen it
4/5/24, 1:20 am - James: Not an important game at the time
4/5/24, 1:20 am - James: Well well well

4/5/24, 1:28 am - James: Shame the ball was in at SJP earlier in the season hey

4/5/24, 1:29 am - Liam: Well might not matter 🤷🏻
4/5/24, 1:29 am - Liam: Have to wait and see
4/5/24, 1:30 am - Liam: It’s very exciting

4/5/24, 1:32 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 your plan worked, they obsessed with Livo again
4/5/24, 1:46 am - Liam: We not allowed to talk about Liverpool ?
4/5/24, 1:46 am - Liam: What’s wrong with talking about Liverpool?
4/5/24, 1:47 am - Liam: They were title favourites 2 weeks ago, going to do the quadruple.
4/5/24, 1:47 am - Liam: Arguably the most talked about team in the world 2 weeks ago
4/5/24, 1:48 am - Liam: So most expectation
4/5/24, 1:48 am - James: Very active this morning
4/5/24, 1:48 am - Liam: Klopp leaving

4/5/24, 1:55 am - James: You talking to me?
4/5/24, 1:59 am - Gerrard: I think he's talking to you
4/5/24, 2:01 am - James: Oft, villa got pumped by olympiakos at home
4/5/24, 2:02 am - Dave: No gez. But then I read it again and realised it was you with the apparent plan. So same applies for you
4/5/24, 2:03 am - Dave: Don’t know why I’m loving this. We got dicked by them both times this season
4/5/24, 2:03 am - James: Farmers league
4/5/24, 2:03 am - James: English clubs been atrocious in Europe
4/5/24, 2:04 am - James: No way villa go to Greece and win
4/5/24, 2:04 am - James: Hostile as fuck
4/5/24, 2:06 am - Dave: We’re the new farmers of Europe
4/5/24, 2:06 am - Dave: Premier league
4/5/24, 2:06 am - Liam: Klopp said it’s because of the fixture schedule
4/5/24, 2:07 am - Dave: Right
4/5/24, 2:07 am - Dave: Not the grass?
4/5/24, 2:07 am - Dave: Or the wind?
4/5/24, 2:07 am - Dave: Or the heat?
4/5/24, 2:07 am - Dave: Or the rain?
4/5/24, 2:07 am - Liam: Na, 1230 kick off, said its reason they are out of Europe
4/5/24, 2:08 am - Liam: Too much
4/5/24, 2:08 am - Liam: He’s wasn’t happy
4/5/24, 2:08 am - Liam: But I’m not sure he cares anymore
4/5/24, 2:13 am - James: 😳
4/5/24, 2:26 am - Dave: Such a bitch
4/5/24, 2:29 am - Gerrard: They so aggressive, I think they've finally realised they ain't winning anything for another year
4/5/24, 2:32 am - Dave: Always knew that. Weren’t deluded unlike some other fanbases 🙃
4/5/24, 2:35 am - James: Who a rattle
4/5/24, 2:38 am - Gerrard: You tell me
4/5/24, 4:42 am - Dave: ❤️ https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6OQESBvnA2/?igsh=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==
4/5/24, 2:13 pm - Jono: Nice dive 😅
4/5/24, 2:16 pm - Pero: Finally a goal
4/5/24, 2:17 pm - Pero: A pen all day
4/5/24, 2:38 pm - Jono: Haha fuck me

4/5/24, 3:02 pm - James: Over
4/5/24, 3:03 pm - Pero: Needed that. Bournemouth were getting into the match
4/5/24, 3:05 pm - Jono: What’s VAR gonna fuck up this time
4/5/24, 3:11 pm - Pero: Trossard is gassed
4/5/24, 3:34 pm - Liam: VAR was kind today
4/5/24, 3:35 pm - Liam: Bournemouth should of had a red
4/5/24, 3:35 pm - Pero: Nervey bloody game
4/5/24, 3:35 pm - Pero: Couldn't score in that first half I was thinking it's gonna be one of those games
4/5/24, 3:36 pm - Liam: Keeper nearly chopped havertz in half for the pen
4/5/24, 3:38 pm - Pero: Suprised harvertz has both ankles attached
4/5/24, 3:39 pm - Pero: Havertz another cracker game today
4/5/24, 4:44 pm - James: On fire 🔥
4/5/24, 6:02 pm - Dave: Havertz the man
4/5/24, 6:42 pm - Dave: How’s that a fucking pen.
4/5/24, 6:42 pm - Dave: Went for the ball, wasn’t even looking at him
4/5/24, 6:42 pm - Dave: City start moaning at the ref and he instantly gives it
4/5/24, 6:48 pm - James: Big win 🔥
4/5/24, 6:49 pm - James: Eddie Howes injury ravaged mags
4/5/24, 7:57 pm - James: Citeh winning the league
4/5/24, 8:00 pm - James: Haaland decided to win Golden boot then

5/5/24, 2:30 am - Dave: Fuck off 😂😂😂😂😂
5/5/24, 2:32 am - Pero: Big time tranny
5/5/24, 2:38 am - Gerrard: When does City's game in hand come into effect and you guys can all relax?
5/5/24, 2:39 am - Dave: No wonder he can’t defend to save his life. Tripping over those big bellend bottoms
5/5/24, 2:40 am - Dave: When are you playing again so I know to open whatsapp? Can’t wait for next games drama 🤤
5/5/24, 2:41 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 why is this guy so sensitive?
5/5/24, 2:42 am - Gerrard: Not enough peanut butter?
5/5/24, 4:27 am - Gerrard: Why is there an asterisk?
5/5/24, 5:58 am - Dave: Don’t know mate. Ask Castrol
5/5/24, 5:58 am - Gerrard: So defensive
5/5/24, 6:28 am - Liam: Raya the best keeper in the league?
5/5/24, 6:29 am - Liam: Most goals scored
5/5/24, 6:29 am - Liam: Least goals conceded
5/5/24, 6:30 am - Liam: @61409710717 has Mikel’s done a great job?
5/5/24, 6:35 am - Dave: @61409710717
5/5/24, 6:59 am - Gerrard: Nah he's a fucking joke
5/5/24, 7:00 am - Gerrard: It's just spending money innit
5/5/24, 7:01 am - Gerrard: He's Gary O'Neill with money
5/5/24, 7:01 am - Gerrard: And I feel that's a slight on Gary
5/5/24, 7:30 am - Dave: Gary o’neill is a great manager. Not sure why you’re throwing punches
5/5/24, 7:30 am - Dave: You’re about to have poor mans ten hag at the helm
5/5/24, 7:30 am - Dave: Banterpool about to get a whole lot funnier
5/5/24, 7:34 am - Gerrard: Sorry give me an awful manager's name and I'll say Arteta is him but with money
5/5/24, 7:35 am - Gerrard: By the way, none of these are shots - you and Larry asked me for my honest opinion on Arteta
5/5/24, 10:18 am - James: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6jyMiytqPQ/?igsh=MTd3MjlpdnpoM3l0bw==
5/5/24, 10:29 am - Gerrard: And delicious
5/5/24, 10:30 am - Gerrard: Don't be slack, they'll get a chance at the community shield next year by coming 2nd.
As long as City beat United in the FA Cup final, of course. <This message was edited>
5/5/24, 6:26 pm - Dave: What are you going to be getting a chance at?
5/5/24, 6:26 pm - Dave: We’ll get there. At least we’re not crying about oil money and how unfair life is like some fanbases. Just happy to be a part of it ❤️
5/5/24, 10:43 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 struck a nerve
5/5/24, 11:23 pm - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/watch?v=DrCOUcU59sg&si=YSHtMOH3-1uiQbES
First line from Rory is worth it
6/5/24, 12:00 am - Dave: Shut the group down, I think we agree on something 🤯
6/5/24, 12:00 am - Gerrard: Wait til after Arsenal don't win the league first
6/5/24, 12:03 am - Dave: We’ve always known they’re not me old mucca. This only works if the players and fan base spend 4 months saying they’re winning a quadruple
6/5/24, 12:06 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 changing the topic again like a chick
6/5/24, 6:24 am - Pero: https://www.facebook.com/share/v/GQ3CUpyMZuJB4Qav/?mibextid=wILeQC
6/5/24, 7:25 am - Gerrard: Definitely more upside
6/5/24, 7:32 am - James: They're both shit
6/5/24, 7:34 am - Gerrard: Wow
6/5/24, 8:47 am - Dave: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6jxxbwtKwW/?igsh=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==
6/5/24, 9:36 am - Jono: Not good
6/5/24, 10:01 am - James: They do this. Remember Karius
6/5/24, 10:01 am - James: Terrible footballer though
6/5/24, 10:11 am - Gerrard: Play better and no one gets hurt
6/5/24, 10:11 am - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/watch?v=smEC9VQ4lK8&si=-fXsgI5PlNwtZxGY
Put your savings on it
6/5/24, 10:21 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4k1_U8opz2/?igsh=b2Q2bTZ3cnU5cjU1
6/5/24, 10:32 am - Pero: Classless sumbags
6/5/24, 10:38 am - Gerrard: Whoa
6/5/24, 11:01 am - James: Spurs bottling 5th
6/5/24, 11:01 am - James: Shame that won't get you CL now
6/5/24, 11:01 am - James: Thanks to Varsenal 🧐
6/5/24, 11:19 am - Gerrard: Arsenal's trophy this year is Tottenham not getting CL.
United's trophy this year is ruining Liverpool's season.
Newtle's trophy this season is not falling off completely.
Liverpool's trophy this season is an actual trophy that the other teams would love to win but if they don't they say it's meaningless.
6/5/24, 1:20 pm - Gerrard: Copying my gifs, amateur hour
6/5/24, 1:20 pm - Gerrard: Go back into seclusion Larry, this a place for real fans
6/5/24, 1:20 pm - James: Ya but Varpool fans say that trophy is meaningless when they don't win it tbf
6/5/24, 1:21 pm - James: Varsey not won a thing again?
6/5/24, 1:21 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 if anyone here disappeared while their team was shit it's @61478754484
6/5/24, 1:21 pm - Gerrard: Giving it the biggun now
6/5/24, 1:22 pm - Liam: When newy win something last?
6/5/24, 1:22 pm - James: Hope manure finish 8th
6/5/24, 1:22 pm - James: Classic behaviour
6/5/24, 1:23 pm - James: @61409710717 is it true varspy have never defended a title?
6/5/24, 1:23 pm - Gerrard: Newty probably had more parades than Arsenal
6/5/24, 1:23 pm - Gerrard: Sounds true
6/5/24, 1:23 pm - Gerrard: But they got a trophy with gold handles for a lot of draws
6/5/24, 1:28 pm - Liam: Do your teams have a gold PL title?
6/5/24, 1:33 pm - James: The Conor McGregor of football teams @61409710717
6/5/24, 1:34 pm - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣 holy shit that's spot on
6/5/24, 2:53 pm - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4AMD__ob9M/?igsh=MWJ3bGFhZGZiOGNw
Oldie but a goodie

@61452662705 who does he remind you of?
6/5/24, 3:35 pm - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/p/C6PKL_zyKx0/?igsh=MTh3dHZ2eDJubzZ4eA==
6/5/24, 5:51 pm - Dave: 🙋🏼‍♂️ 1955
6/5/24, 5:55 pm - Dave: Defended it multiple times..
6/5/24, 9:52 pm - James: Manure getting pumped
6/5/24, 10:29 pm - Dave: Caretaker manager bounce incoming for us on Sunday
6/5/24, 10:29 pm - Dave: How this cunt hasn’t been sacked blows my mind
6/5/24, 10:30 pm - James: Would be hilarious if you don't beat these
6/5/24, 10:30 pm - James: Should pump them double figures
6/5/24, 10:30 pm - James: Would love olisse
6/5/24, 10:37 pm - Dave: You know what United are like
6/5/24, 10:38 pm - Dave: If they turn up, they have the talent there to beat most sides. Just not a team
6/5/24, 10:38 pm - Dave: Got enough individual talent to fuck you though if they decide to show up
6/5/24, 10:42 pm - James: Destroyed kloppsys farewell
6/5/24, 10:42 pm - James: Twice 😂
6/5/24, 10:43 pm - Dave: ETH > Klapp?
6/5/24, 11:00 pm - James: Well his first season is better than klaps last season
6/5/24, 11:00 pm - James: 🤷
6/5/24, 11:22 pm - Gerrard: @61413646755 Casemiro is such a good centreback
6/5/24, 11:42 pm - Jono: https://youtu.be/0jkjuELL7Yw?si=U1sKSBZnPt7UJQ4C
6/5/24, 11:53 pm - James: Eze and Olise would be cracking signings
6/5/24, 11:53 pm - James: Dunno about that. Lots out injured atm
6/5/24, 11:54 pm - James: Garnacho and unfortunately Fernandes are the only players worth a wank <This message was edited>
6/5/24, 11:54 pm - Dave: Yeah I didn’t realise how many injuries they had mate. I was talking about it to a United fan and he reeled them all off
6/5/24, 11:54 pm - Dave: He said Martinez, Shaw and varane out as well
6/5/24, 11:54 pm - James: Not as bad as us
6/5/24, 11:55 pm - Dave: Yeah but your manager knows what he’s doing
6/5/24, 11:55 pm - James: Manure should be 16th in the league apparently lol
6/5/24, 11:55 pm - James: Going by xg
6/5/24, 11:55 pm - James: Starting to play that way atm
7/5/24, 12:23 am - Louie: End the season already before we miss out on Europe
7/5/24, 12:25 am - James: You will probably win the FA Cup, we'll get 6th and not get Europe because of it
7/5/24, 2:28 am - James: He did achieve more than Klapp  in his first season versus klaps last though?
7/5/24, 4:18 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6d44z6Iym6/?igsh=MXRyYTNxYzh3cnRrag==
7/5/24, 4:21 am - James: What ever happened to Trent De Bruyne?
7/5/24, 4:22 am - James: Next Pirlo end of last season
7/5/24, 4:22 am - James: No better passer in world football?
7/5/24, 4:25 am - Gerrard: 💦💦💦
7/5/24, 4:25 am - Gerrard: When you say it like that I get excited for football again
7/5/24, 4:34 am - James: 'big six' 😬
7/5/24, 4:35 am - James: 7 major trophies!?
7/5/24, 4:35 am - James: I can only think of PL, CL and FA?
7/5/24, 4:35 am - James: Varsenal x2 charity shields?
7/5/24, 4:36 am - Gerrard: I think there was Emery's FA Cup then that community shield.
7/5/24, 4:36 am - James: Woah look at the net spend 😬
7/5/24, 4:36 am - James: £700m
7/5/24, 4:36 am - Gerrard: I know right
7/5/24, 4:36 am - Gerrard: Money talks
7/5/24, 4:37 am - James: If Emery had £700m to spend they'd have been champions by now
7/5/24, 4:37 am - Gerrard: CL too
7/5/24, 4:37 am - James: Sometimes
7/5/24, 4:37 am - Gerrard: United?
7/5/24, 4:38 am - James: Emery won 5 Europas with $1
7/5/24, 4:38 am - Gerrard: Chelsea done a lot more than Arsenal with only 300m more
7/5/24, 4:38 am - James: Biggest club in London unfortunately
7/5/24, 4:39 am - Gerrard: They'd never won the league before 2005?
7/5/24, 4:41 am - Gerrard: And then superseded Arsenal since?
7/5/24, 4:42 am - James: Think they may have won 1?
7/5/24, 4:43 am - James: Before PL became PL
7/5/24, 4:43 am - James: But they have two CLs?
7/5/24, 4:43 am - James: So, domestically and internationally they are known as a bigger club than Varsey
7/5/24, 4:43 am - Gerrard: CL counts for more than some gold handles
7/5/24, 4:43 am - James: That Jose team shits on that one
7/5/24, 4:43 am - Gerrard: I think Arsenal are a good cup team
7/5/24, 4:44 am - James: Ashley Cole said himself he was 'right' when he left
7/5/24, 4:44 am - Gerrard: Was it only 15 conceded?
7/5/24, 4:44 am - James: Are they? They've been knocked out first round of everything for two years now
7/5/24, 4:44 am - Gerrard: Historically
7/5/24, 4:47 am - James: They've won cups 'shields' by default because another team did the double the previous season?
7/5/24, 4:51 am - Gerrard: Kinda fucked up eh, if anything it should be the team who lost in the cup final that gets to play in it
7/5/24, 4:54 am - James: That's what it used to be
7/5/24, 4:54 am - James: I know this because we got to a charity shield final in the late '90s and lost 4-0 to manure
7/5/24, 4:55 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 do you think these guys will start being realistic about Arteta once City win the league?
7/5/24, 4:55 am - James: But we then beat them 5-0 that season
7/5/24, 4:55 am - James: That's he's just not good enough?
7/5/24, 4:55 am - Gerrard: How much more money does he need?

Or just be happy being a top 4 team <This message was edited>
7/5/24, 5:00 am - Jono: PL, CL, FA, CC x2, Club WC, UEFA Super Cup
7/5/24, 5:00 am - Jono: Community shields appear to be removed from that list
7/5/24, 5:03 am - James: No sledge there I just didn't think 'major' was charity shields, caraboos and the WC and Sperm cup
7/5/24, 5:42 am - Liam: 2 trophies 🫶🏻
7/5/24, 5:43 am - Gerrard: Both before Arteta?
7/5/24, 6:00 am - James: Charity shields?
7/5/24, 6:00 am - James: 'major'
7/5/24, 6:00 am - James: 🧐
7/5/24, 6:03 am - James: So rice has dropped off or this guy came good again?
7/5/24, 6:19 am - Liam: Arteta has one
7/5/24, 6:22 am - Gerrard: Counting Emery's?
7/5/24, 6:45 am - Liam: Emery lost the final for us
7/5/24, 6:45 am - Liam: I don’t count losses
7/5/24, 6:55 am - Dave: Emery was dog shit. Bottle job
7/5/24, 6:55 am - Dave: Villa spent a fortune
7/5/24, 6:55 am - Dave: Bore off
7/5/24, 6:56 am - Dave: Net spend argument always comes out when Liverpool are under fire. Klapp inheriting worlds most expensive transfer didn’t help that number whatsoever

7/5/24, 1:16 pm - James: Wasn't Ange a good aus manager?

7/5/24, 2:28 pm - Gerrard: He's done better than Arteta, if you consider the spending
7/5/24, 2:28 pm - James: Similar. Less spending though
7/5/24, 2:29 pm - Gerrard: Took Arteta four seasons to get top 4
7/5/24, 2:29 pm - Gerrard: Took him 3 years to get into top 7
7/5/24, 10:28 pm - Jono: Sancho in a champions league final 🙈

7/5/24, 11:43 pm - Dave: Two full seasons. 8th to 5th in first. 5th to 2nd in second
7/5/24, 11:43 pm - Dave: We’re not counting the half a season taking over from Emery when Arsenal were 12th
7/5/24, 11:44 pm - Gerrard: "full seasons" @61452662705 sensitive
7/5/24, 11:45 pm - Dave: No clue mate. Just happy to see him go in on Neville 😂
7/5/24, 11:47 pm - James: Justice!
7/5/24, 11:47 pm - James: Really was the group of death. Two teams got to the semis
7/5/24, 11:47 pm - James: Hope Dortmund go all the way
8/5/24, 12:17 am - Pero: 😂😂 the place is falling apart
8/5/24, 12:42 am - James: Southgate for next season too
8/5/24, 1:06 am - Jono: https://x.com/paddypower/status/1787862535179280721
8/5/24, 2:07 am - Gerrard: What year?
8/5/24, 2:08 am - Jono: I’ve been advised this is in fact from the Belgium league
8/5/24, 2:08 am - Jono: Same shit I suppose
8/5/24, 2:08 am - Jono: They also lost the game
8/5/24, 2:12 am - Pero: It wouldn't be in the last few years of woke movement that's for sure

8/5/24, 6:19 am - Gerrard: Hey @61452662705 got a question for you....
8/5/24, 6:19 am - Gerrard: Did you know that Dortmund have been to more Champions League finals than Arsenal?
8/5/24, 6:33 am - Jono: Some teams are just built for Europe more
8/5/24, 6:36 am - Dave: Agree. We’ll get there one day
8/5/24, 6:36 am - Dave: Took pep years with city. Best manager in the world and unlimited resources. Not an easy comp to win
8/5/24, 7:00 am - Gerrard: Are you saying that Arsenal were plastic too?
8/5/24, 7:02 am - Dave: Don’t know why you hate Arsenal so much mate. You’re slipping into obscurity again for the foreseeable, just be happy for the clubs that are on an upwards trajectory like Arsenal and Newcastle 🤷‍♂️
8/5/24, 7:03 am - Gerrard: Wow taking a shit at Liverpool out of nowhere, rent free
8/5/24, 7:15 am - James: 😳
8/5/24, 8:00 am - Gerrard: I personally like the "slipping into obscurity" part
8/5/24, 8:08 am - James: https://x.com/NUFC/status/1787847908852641957?s=08
8/5/24, 8:09 am - James: Saudis now starting their own Formula 1

8/5/24, 3:30 pm - Shaun: Where is Rooney?
8/5/24, 5:59 pm - Dave: Participation trophy
8/5/24, 5:59 pm - Dave: Another top tier English managerial prodigy
8/5/24, 10:49 pm - Jono: Madrid man… built for this shit
8/5/24, 10:55 pm - Dave: 100%. Just have another gear, always find a way
8/5/24, 10:55 pm - Gerrard: Because the following year Arsenal lost the CL final
8/5/24, 10:56 pm - James: That technically wasn't 'legal' back then either. For what ever reason it wasn't enforced. Had the ref been strong, Milan would have won
8/5/24, 10:57 pm - Dave: So what you’re saying is. Out of the 3 major trophies you’ve won in the last 35 years… 

1 was during a global pandemic where half the leagues players weren’t available. 

1 was beating Tottenham in a final

1 was with a cheating goalkeeper 

That correct?
8/5/24, 11:01 pm - Dave: Wow. That Bayern goal was onside
8/5/24, 11:01 pm - Dave: Ref dropped the ball there, blew whistle too early before review
8/5/24, 11:01 pm - Dave: Wow
8/5/24, 11:02 pm - Dave: That’ll be talked about for years
8/5/24, 11:05 pm - Pero: Very weird to blow the whistle so early. They let play go every other time why not this time ?
8/5/24, 11:08 pm - Dave: Probably on books. Officiating is so bad man
8/5/24, 11:08 pm - Dave: Tuchel fucked it parking the bus. Why take off Kane and Musiala, what was he resting them for
8/5/24, 11:09 pm - Pero: Soooo dumb ! And the 3 on 1 bayern had, if kane was on he probably would of scored
8/5/24, 11:16 pm - James: Do real just get battered each week but somehow win
8/5/24, 11:16 pm - James: Been like this for years
8/5/24, 11:16 pm - James: Player for player, they got to have the best team in the world. Midfield anyway
8/5/24, 11:16 pm - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6t49aMrMMz/?igsh=aDN6a2dxZ2Q1c3oy
8/5/24, 11:17 pm - James: You seen ancelotti's trophies? Gotta be the goat
8/5/24, 11:17 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 what's he whinging about this morning?
8/5/24, 11:26 pm - Dave: @61409710717
8/5/24, 11:37 pm - Gerrard: What?
9/5/24, 12:10 am - James: https://youtu.be/p6ihWYm8waY?si=qVVCILb9KVHztqzC
9/5/24, 12:11 am - James: He's going to start believing he's cursed now. Joining Bayern was a banker for a trophy
9/5/24, 12:12 am - Dave: “Go to Bayern to win trophies” they said
9/5/24, 12:54 am - Pero: Thats real for ya, champions league is their thing
9/5/24, 1:43 am - Gerrard: You think anyone opened this and watched the whole thing?
9/5/24, 5:45 am - James: This real 😂😂😂
9/5/24, 5:45 am - James: What a cringe
9/5/24, 5:47 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I also just thought that Arsenal would've had to pay music rights to Gerry & The Pacemakers or Liverpool for playing YNWA during training on that doco too 🤣
9/5/24, 5:49 am - Gerrard: When Arsenal don't win again I'm sending light bulbs and tshirts with the cartoon brain and heart to all these guys
9/5/24, 5:49 am - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/watch?v=IOmGdGrRcd0&si=JnaMoQd57nq_Dw5g
Referees at it again?
9/5/24, 5:50 am - James: Stop it 😂
9/5/24, 5:51 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 also this meme was from an Arsenal fan page, like it's a positive thing 🤣
9/5/24, 6:07 am - James: Just noticed that. They're flexing 🤣
9/5/24, 6:26 am - Dave: Maybe Karabao Klapp should try it 🔥
9/5/24, 6:26 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 oh he's not on today 🤣🤣🤣
9/5/24, 6:28 am - Dave: If Karabao Klapp had been getting wolves to carry Liverpool flags instead of having his teenagers talking about winning quads and crying about arteta stealing their celebrations, they might be top of the table. 

Just saying lad
9/5/24, 6:29 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 DM him and help, ghostwrite for him
9/5/24, 6:32 am - James: Fuck

9/5/24, 7:18 am - James: He's calling me 😬
9/5/24, 7:18 am - JD: Haha on holiday trying to leave this group 🤣
9/5/24, 7:18 am - Gerrard: Ouch
9/5/24, 7:18 am - JD: Joking.
9/5/24, 7:18 am - Gerrard: I muted it months ago

@61452662705 I told you Atalanta were good
10/5/24, 5:36 am - Dave: You’re getting mixed up between squad value and club value armchair jez
10/5/24, 5:37 am - Dave: Bit harsh on Brendan
10/5/24, 5:37 am - Jono: This could end up ringing true
10/5/24, 5:39 am - Jono: You know its never been great for the men when chicks dominate a top 10 lists of greatest footballers
10/5/24, 5:41 am - James: Woke and embarrassing
10/5/24, 5:41 am - James: The worst Aussie men's footballer is better than Sam Kerr
10/5/24, 5:42 am - Jono: My goddaughter is playing U10s reps for Sydney Olympic girls team and playing against boys who are 'transitioning' and scoring 5+ goals a game
10/5/24, 5:42 am - James: An overweight, retired, coked up bosnich is better
10/5/24, 5:42 am - Jono: Speaking of woke
10/5/24, 5:43 am - Jono: One other objection i have is Viduka in that list. Amazing at club level. Fucking terrible for the Socceroos
10/5/24, 5:43 am - Jono: His stats prove it
10/5/24, 5:49 am - James: How'd villa screw up the conference league
10/5/24, 5:49 am - James: 6-2 on agg 😳
10/5/24, 5:53 am - Jono: PL fatigue innit
10/5/24, 5:53 am - Jono: Maybe Klapp was right 😛
10/5/24, 5:54 am - Jono: These greek fucks get about 8 weeks off in December to make ouzo
10/5/24, 5:58 am - Dave: Ouzo. Now that’s a word I haven’t heard in a long time 🤮
10/5/24, 5:59 am - Jono: Had a lethal experience with it at Athens Backpackers
10/5/24, 5:59 am - Jono: 50c shots from the rooftop bar only to vomit it all out onto a busy street

10/5/24, 6:56 am - Gerrard: @61422023136 I want a good one from you
10/5/24, 9:09 am - Pero: Their bodies are subconsciously preparing for the time of the month they get anal
10/5/24, 9:09 am - Pero: Perhaps ?
10/5/24, 10:32 am - Gerrard: Wow I thought you might say, can't do you acl while in the kitchen
10/5/24, 10:40 am - James: Pay them the same!
10/5/24, 10:52 am - Jono: Fucking pussies
10/5/24, 11:59 am - Pero: They can't use this statement anymore, research shows they are basically injured 1 out of 4 weeks of the month
10/5/24, 12:00 pm - Pero: Just like jota, when he was playing every game you'd pay 50-60m for him, now that he has been injured alot he isn't worth as much
10/5/24, 12:58 pm - Jono: https://x.com/adamsinger/status/1788546696797909429?s=48

10/5/24, 1:07 pm - Pero: Sugar overload
10/5/24, 1:07 pm - Jono: Calorie count matching price count
10/5/24, 1:09 pm - Jono: At least she went with a palette cleansing fruity soft serve to set herself up for dinner when she gets home <This message was edited>
10/5/24, 1:24 pm - Pero: She earned it after walking so much she'll have 7 cakes waiting for her when she gets home
10/5/24, 1:26 pm - Jono: No way she was walking around. She would’ve bought an unlimited mickey mini train pass to get to her 4000 eateries

10/5/24, 6:17 pm - Dave: Watch out Raya lol. Pickford is definitely getting a start over him
10/5/24, 11:45 pm - Jono: He does
11/5/24, 12:36 am - Dave: Wild
11/5/24, 3:07 am - Gerrard: Give him a bust
11/5/24, 3:08 am - Gerrard: Arteta things
11/5/24, 3:12 am - Dave: Pickford is better than Raya 🤷‍♂️ I’d have him in a heartbeat
11/5/24, 3:13 am - Gerrard: Can't wait to see Arteta sign a star right winger and he drops Starboi
11/5/24, 3:13 am - Dave: They can have a t-rex arm battle in training
11/5/24, 3:13 am - Gerrard: See which side the AFTV boys here choose
11/5/24, 3:13 am - Dave: Who’s better than star boy right now?
11/5/24, 3:14 am - Gerrard: I can't be bothered typing such a long list
11/5/24, 3:15 am - Gerrard: If Arsenal sign Bowen....
11/5/24, 3:22 am - Dave: Saka is better than Bowen lol, you joking
11/5/24, 3:25 am - Dave: Feelings hurt, standard

12/5/24, 1:34 am - Dave: Not so fast. Need you to beat Villa on Monday
12/5/24, 1:35 am - Dave: Beat Villa Monday. Give spurs something to play for
12/5/24, 1:35 am - Dave: They’re doing laps of honor after beating Burnley right now, cunts are already on holiday 😭🤮

12/5/24, 1:54 am - Pero: Spurs are joke they'll let city get a better goal difference too they'll bend over for minimum 5 goals. How are city catching up on goal difference now
12/5/24, 2:01 am - Gerrard: City supporting or using a Drake gif, what's the biggest disgrace???
12/5/24, 2:03 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 what if United and Chelsea finish above Newtle?
12/5/24, 2:05 am - Dave: Spuds fans are odd. 

“I hope Ange sends out the kids”
“We’re bending over for City” 

Tall poppy syndrome. Would rather the title goes north to the oil cheats vs back to London.
12/5/24, 2:06 am - Dave: They won’t
12/5/24, 2:15 am - Gerrard: Overused pic, City fans are so plastic

12/5/24, 5:38 am - Dave: I’ve been expecting city to win since we dropped all those points at Christmas so not going to be a shock. 

There’s only one scenario that I’ll cry… 

If we beat United, city drop points against spurs on Tuesday and we lose to Everton on the final game of the season when it’s in our hands to win it.

If that happens, you’ll get your pic 🤝
12/5/24, 5:39 am - Gerrard: Whoa don't get so upset

14/5/24, 1:23 am - Dave: I’d accept all of those outcomes. The one that would really hurt is if city slip up but we fuck it up against Everton 😂😂😂 <This message was edited>

14/5/24, 5:07 am - Gerrard: @61404060785 that header Livo goal was sick though innit
14/5/24, 5:07 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 what you think of Villa's 3rd?

14/5/24, 10:57 pm - Dave: Dark day the game
14/5/24, 10:58 pm - James: @61409710717 I think the varsey girls thought they actually had a chance of winning the title 🤣
14/5/24, 10:58 pm - James: 5 defeats in a row for mate
14/5/24, 11:00 pm - Gerrard: Title was over after Liverpool dropped off
14/5/24, 11:01 pm - James: You all thought you win it
14/5/24, 11:01 pm - James: Lol
14/5/24, 11:02 pm - Gerrard: So City won 2-0 today but they cheated?
14/5/24, 11:02 pm - James: Apparently
14/5/24, 11:02 pm - Dave: Behave, you were never in it
14/5/24, 11:02 pm - Dave: We all knew that
14/5/24, 11:02 pm - James: @61409710717 so artetsey spent all that money to finish 2nd again?
14/5/24, 11:02 pm - Jono: 50/50 call. Still not as blatant as the no pen for the Rodri handball at Goodison
14/5/24, 11:03 pm - Jono: But again, welcome to the premier league
14/5/24, 11:03 pm - Dave: VAR should have reviewed. Ref didn’t have a clear view
14/5/24, 11:03 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 apparently Liverpool weren't in it so I guess there'll be no talk of bottling there....
14/5/24, 11:03 pm - James: Maybe varsey fans should concentrate on themselves and their own failures 🤷
14/5/24, 11:03 pm - Dave: What’s the point in having VAR if it’s not going to review
14/5/24, 11:03 pm - Gerrard: Many many failures
14/5/24, 11:03 pm - James: @61409710717 var did review lols
14/5/24, 11:03 pm - Dave: Why you bringing Liverpool into this. Don’t make me dig that gif out
14/5/24, 11:03 pm - James: And they still would of lost it was 2-0 🤣
14/5/24, 11:04 pm - Dave: No they didn’t..
14/5/24, 11:04 pm - Gerrard: Maybe VAR can do a review on if Arsenal are bottlejobs
14/5/24, 11:04 pm - James: @61409710717 so salty this morning
14/5/24, 11:04 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 look at him rattle

14/5/24, 11:05 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 zero class, total AFTV in here
14/5/24, 11:05 pm - James: @61409710717 league is corrupt because we lost to Newcastle and Villa
14/5/24, 11:05 pm - James: Odd bunch
14/5/24, 11:05 pm - James: @61409710717 I have to get on with work but if you get chance can you send over the AFTV reactions when they're posted
14/5/24, 11:06 pm - Dave: Won’t happen next year because we’re raiding your squad this summer
14/5/24, 11:06 pm - James: Great watch for smoko
14/5/24, 11:06 pm - Dave: Be left with a few Longstaffs and burns

14/5/24, 11:07 pm - Gerrard: Completely
14/5/24, 11:07 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 embarrassing
14/5/24, 11:07 pm - Dave: All my other footy groups talking about how corrupt the prem is
14/5/24, 11:08 pm - Pero: Wow what scenes
14/5/24, 11:08 pm - Dave: And then there’s this group
14/5/24, 11:08 pm - James: I know
14/5/24, 11:08 pm - James: Deeesgraaace
14/5/24, 11:08 pm - Jono: This was it tbh
14/5/24, 11:08 pm - Jono: Not the pen call
14/5/24, 11:09 pm - Pero: Don't worry lads we still got a chance. Imagine city draw and we win it by GD of 1 ... this is still possible
14/5/24, 11:09 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 @61404060785 how's badly is Arteta taking it?
14/5/24, 11:09 pm - Dave: Give me my final dose of hopium
14/5/24, 11:09 pm - Dave: ❤️
14/5/24, 11:09 pm - James: So much money spent. Zero improvement
14/5/24, 11:09 pm - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
14/5/24, 11:09 pm - Jono: Son in any other game at home this season slots that
14/5/24, 11:09 pm - Jono: How often they’ve scored late
14/5/24, 11:09 pm - James: Maybe he did it on purpose
14/5/24, 11:10 pm - Gerrard: Time for Arteta to go, 700m net spent and zero trophies
14/5/24, 11:10 pm - James: #Corrupt
14/5/24, 11:10 pm - Dave: Doku strikes again
14/5/24, 11:10 pm - Dave: Can’t believe it
14/5/24, 11:10 pm - James: Won't get anywhere until they appoint a real manager
14/5/24, 11:10 pm - Dave: Remember when he karate kicked Mac Allister
14/5/24, 11:11 pm - Dave: Studs to the heart
14/5/24, 11:11 pm - Dave: NO PEN
14/5/24, 11:11 pm - Dave: Reckon he’s got a VAR shield
14/5/24, 11:12 pm - Dave: Howard Webbs rent boy
14/5/24, 11:12 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 "I need more pictures of wolves and more light bulbs!"
14/5/24, 11:13 pm - Dave: Neither will you. 

Newty are Southampton 2.0
14/5/24, 11:13 pm - Dave: Going to RAID that club
14/5/24, 11:14 pm - Dave: Benchy bruno ❤️
14/5/24, 11:14 pm - James: @61409710717 oh dear 🤣
14/5/24, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: Why are you attacking Newtle after Arsenal bottled the title?
14/5/24, 11:14 pm - Dave: Heard were one of many after isak as well
14/5/24, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: It's not their fault
14/5/24, 11:14 pm - James: That's what they do
14/5/24, 11:14 pm - Dave: Going to be a fantastic summer
14/5/24, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: It's Arteta's fault
14/5/24, 11:14 pm - James: Well remember the ball not going out...
14/5/24, 11:15 pm - James: Came back to haunt them 😁
14/5/24, 11:15 pm - Jono: Tonight’s other big winner…
14/5/24, 11:15 pm - Liam: Give him what he wants
14/5/24, 11:16 pm - Jono: Takes his team to the CL again after 42 years and ruined his former clubs title aspirations
14/5/24, 11:17 pm - Liam: Correct, it is his fault we are title contenders 2 years in a row
14/5/24, 11:17 pm - James: This is so true
14/5/24, 11:17 pm - James: But somehow he wasn't good enough but the Spanish Lego head loser is?
14/5/24, 11:18 pm - Gerrard: Oooooo contenders
14/5/24, 11:18 pm - James: 'contenders' @61409710717 <This message was edited>
14/5/24, 11:18 pm - Dave: Got. Ball. First
14/5/24, 11:18 pm - Dave: No var
14/5/24, 11:18 pm - James: @61409710717 ohhhh contender friends <This message was edited>
14/5/24, 11:18 pm - Dave: Scripted
14/5/24, 11:18 pm - Liam: Great tackle
14/5/24, 11:19 pm - ~ James changed the group name from "Auf Wiedersehen Klapp" to "Contender Friends"
14/5/24, 11:19 pm - Dave: 117 charges and no repercussions. Everton, forest, Leicester etc charged
14/5/24, 11:19 pm - Dave: Scripted
14/5/24, 11:22 pm - Pero: Absolute disgrace
14/5/24, 11:22 pm - Liam: Great tackle
14/5/24, 11:22 pm - Dave: Moyes masterclass incoming @61422023136 @61478754484 ❤️
14/5/24, 11:23 pm - Pero: 10000%
14/5/24, 11:23 pm - James: Varsey will lose at home to Everton lol
14/5/24, 11:24 pm - James: @61409710717 bet the 'fans' walk out at half time when it doesn't go their way as usual. So toxic <This message was edited>
14/5/24, 11:25 pm - Dave: Racist
14/5/24, 11:26 pm - ~ James changed this group's icon
14/5/24, 11:28 pm - Jono: I see studs on foot and partially ball. 50/50 call as I said. Dont think VAR should cop it but more so the ref to those who think it’s not a penalty coz if it wasn’t given then it wouldn’t be overturned either
14/5/24, 11:29 pm - James: Exactly. It was given and wasn't clear and obvious. Onfield decision stands. Great officiating 👍
14/5/24, 11:32 pm - Jono: I think we’re all winners tonight coz it’s the last time we’ll hear the god awful term of “The Run-In” which the PL have raped sideways this season for some reason
14/5/24, 11:32 pm - Jono: “The Run-In” can lick my balls
14/5/24, 11:36 pm - James: All that's left is who finishes 6,7,8th 🤣
14/5/24, 11:37 pm - James: I'm hoping everything is settled tomorrow so no need to bother with Monday morning 1am
14/5/24, 11:48 pm - Jono: Keeper was so well positioned
14/5/24, 11:53 pm - James: Great save
14/5/24, 11:54 pm - James: Hero
15/5/24, 12:26 am - Pero: Son ate white instead of brown rice before the match 😩
15/5/24, 1:33 am - Dave: https://x.com/papapincus/status/1790505487810666900?s=42&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
15/5/24, 1:34 am - Dave: Even Ange knows it now. Spurs fans cheering when city scored, doing the poznan
15/5/24, 2:12 am - Jono: He’s walked before
15/5/24, 2:12 am - Jono: No surprise if he walks again
15/5/24, 2:13 am - Jono: And Gez before you speak don’t forget that our boy Klopp walked too 😅
15/5/24, 2:13 am - Gerrard: No he didn't
15/5/24, 2:13 am - Gerrard: He retired
15/5/24, 2:14 am - Jono: I’ll bet you 1000 he’ll return to coaching
15/5/24, 2:19 am - Gerrard: Nothing wrong with coming out of retirement
15/5/24, 2:19 am - Jono: He hasn’t retired then
15/5/24, 2:20 am - Gerrard: Roy retired
15/5/24, 2:20 am - Gerrard: Then came out of retirement
15/5/24, 2:20 am - Gerrard: So was he not retired
15/5/24, 2:24 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C696CUsNrzz/?igsh=MWQ1cGtsNmI1ZXBxbw==
Wheels off
15/5/24, 2:29 am - James: Aww you don't believe that
15/5/24, 2:29 am - James: Five defeats in a row
15/5/24, 2:31 am - James: Were we the farmers when manure won 15 from 20 or whatever it was
15/5/24, 2:31 am - James: The 'contenders' just need to be better
15/5/24, 2:32 am - Gerrard: Sssshhhhh it's a bit
15/5/24, 2:32 am - James: Artsey just needs a more powerful light bulb
15/5/24, 2:32 am - Gerrard: Sorry that Liverpool let everyone down by not stopping City win 4
15/5/24, 2:33 am - Gerrard: OH! Are we thinking that Arsenal were contenders
15/5/24, 2:33 am - James: That's what your mate said earlier this morning 🤷
15/5/24, 2:35 am - Gerrard: Wow
15/5/24, 2:35 am - Gerrard: Are bottlers counted?
Like did anyone REALLY think Arsenal were going to win it?
15/5/24, 2:36 am - Gerrard: Things like Istanbul 2005 don't happen regularly
15/5/24, 2:37 am - Gerrard: I mean Arsenal might have been even bigger underdogs than that crappy Livo team vs AC Milan
15/5/24, 2:37 am - James: Yeah but they didn't have to do much. Emery beat them in their own back yard lol
15/5/24, 2:39 am - Gerrard: I am happier that Liverpool were more than 2pts off because that ref Tottenham thing would've ate me up.
What's worse is having the manager you sacked take the 20yr gap title from you.
15/5/24, 2:49 am - James: That's a right shafting
15/5/24, 2:49 am - James: That fucking casting couch
15/5/24, 2:50 am - James: Black meat on white street
15/5/24, 2:54 am - Pero: Wow respect.  Not many have coaches have come out like this
15/5/24, 2:56 am - Pero: Keep contributing to the jinx gez we need every bit of energy possible
15/5/24, 3:00 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 cute
15/5/24, 3:25 am - James: What's happening
15/5/24, 3:27 am - James: https://x.com/NoContextMarkG/status/1790487795921731863?s=08
15/5/24, 5:40 am - Gerrard: He thinks there's still a chance

Conspiracy?
15/5/24, 5:46 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 imagine being an Arsenal fan upset with a Tottenham striker not scoring.
Always someone else's fault.
15/5/24, 5:55 am - James: So strange. So varsey
15/5/24, 6:18 am - Dave: Handing it to us. Best part was city celebrating as if they’d won the league at the end of the game today. Jinx loading ❤️
15/5/24, 6:19 am - Jono: Both teams to drop points plz 🙏🏼
15/5/24, 6:19 am - Jono: Just for banter on here
15/5/24, 6:24 am - James: Pickford masterclass
15/5/24, 6:25 am - Jono: Rehearsal for his Emirates arrival
15/5/24, 6:25 am - James: Varsey can't afford anyone. They got to sell to buy in the summer 😢
15/5/24, 6:29 am - Dave: Sound familiar? Except we’ve got squad players to sell for big £ 😍
15/5/24, 6:30 am - James: Ummm no?
15/5/24, 6:39 am - James: @61409710717 did you hear the whole crowd cheer at the final whistle 🤣
15/5/24, 6:45 am - Gerrard: Arsenal hoping someone else will win them the league, I can say from the experience of Gerrard managing Aston Villa - good luck with that
15/5/24, 6:45 am - Jono: Was thinking about that game the other night... What fuckery that was
15/5/24, 6:46 am - Jono: Especially when Salah scored
15/5/24, 6:46 am - Gerrard: 2-0 up
15/5/24, 6:47 am - Jono: Salah thought Villa were still winning 😰
15/5/24, 6:47 am - Gerrard: Imagine a nice after the final bottle like Sir Alex on the field when Aguero scored 🤣
15/5/24, 6:48 am - Jono: That was the only time i ever cheered for City
15/5/24, 6:48 am - Dave: That was the one of the best games of footy I’ve ever watched
15/5/24, 6:48 am - Jono: So naive
15/5/24, 6:48 am - Dave: Joey Barton drama as well
15/5/24, 6:49 am - Jono: Joey B got completely trolled on field
15/5/24, 6:49 am - Jono: Took the bait
15/5/24, 6:49 am - Dave: Couldn’t have asked for a better championship Sunday
15/5/24, 6:49 am - Jono: Ended his career pretty much
15/5/24, 6:49 am - Dave: Hope we get some drama this Sunday whatever the outcome. At least give us some hope until late in the game
15/5/24, 6:50 am - Gerrard: Not an Arsenal game of course
15/5/24, 6:50 am - Dave: I watched an interview with him a while back where he said he only completely lost it after the red because the lads were telling him him to get a city player sent off as well
15/5/24, 6:51 am - Gerrard: If only Arsenal players had a pair balls like his between them
15/5/24, 6:51 am - Dave: Can appreciate the beautiful game 🤷‍♂️
15/5/24, 6:51 am - Gerrard: Definitely not at Emirates
15/5/24, 6:52 am - Jono: Aguero punched the back of his head hey
15/5/24, 6:52 am - Jono: Aguero only stayed on coz he had a clean reputation
15/5/24, 6:52 am - Jono: If that was Balotelli he'd have been gone too
15/5/24, 6:53 am - Jono: Balotelli's assist for Aguero was pure class though
15/5/24, 6:53 am - Jono: On top of the finish
15/5/24, 6:58 am - Dave: “Why always me” <This message was edited>
15/5/24, 6:58 am - Anthony: Nah. A few guys at aftv don't speak on behalf of the fanbase
15/5/24, 6:59 am - James: He didn't mean it. Was falling over
15/5/24, 7:51 am - Dave: I can confirm, I have no penis anymore
15/5/24, 8:55 am - James: What!?
15/5/24, 10:04 am - James: Funny, Ange is just another manager who's flipped his lid about spurs and their fans / the owner
15/5/24, 10:04 am - James: It's just taken him till the end of the season to throw a strop
15/5/24, 10:04 am - James: Spurs playing at their level now
15/5/24, 10:05 am - James: Probably not promised any funds so he'll end up walking
15/5/24, 10:05 am - James: Might end up at his boyhood club Varpool?
15/5/24, 10:13 am - Jono: Valid point
15/5/24, 10:42 am - Pero: Very similar to when conte flipped his pasta lid

No more VARsenal ?! 😱
15/5/24, 7:27 pm - Dave: That would be a dark day for livarpool. Then throw Lego ten hag into the mixer. Going to be crickets in this group next season
15/5/24, 7:34 pm - Dave: All joking aside about next season, a mate of mine is well connected and he said the real reason Michael Edwards left Liverpool in 2022 because he despised Klopp. He was obviously responsible for all Liverpools great business (selling Coutinho, signing firminho, mane, salah, alisson, VVD etc)
15/5/24, 7:36 pm - Dave: Now Klopp’s off, FSG were able to bring him back in. So the departure of Klopp may not hit too hard if you’ve got this elite director back at the club
15/5/24, 10:21 pm - Jono: Yeah it was widely reported Edwards and Klopp didn’t get along
15/5/24, 10:30 pm - Dave: Didn’t know that. Great news anyway for you lads!
15/5/24, 10:30 pm - James: I knew that it's common knowledge 😅
15/5/24, 10:31 pm - James: It was on talkshite lol
15/5/24, 10:32 pm - Dave: He told me at the same time as something else that definitely isn’t common knowledge so assumed it wasn’t as well
15/5/24, 10:32 pm - Dave: I know nothing about Liverpool back of house lol
15/5/24, 10:33 pm - James: Think I remember because Jordon goes 'yeah and they offered him more money so he went back'
15/5/24, 10:33 pm - James: I wanted Edwards as DOF
15/5/24, 10:33 pm - Dave: 🤷‍♂️ good to have him back anyway. He was responsible for some unreal signings
15/5/24, 10:33 pm - James: Before we got Ashworth
15/5/24, 10:33 pm - Dave: Dog shit transfers at Liverpool since he left
15/5/24, 10:33 pm - James: So I had a small interest
15/5/24, 10:34 pm - Dave: You watching the game brew?
15/5/24, 10:36 pm - James: I'm at work so not really
15/5/24, 10:36 pm - James: I heard Fernandes is having a worldie
15/5/24, 10:37 pm - James: Typical
15/5/24, 10:38 pm - Dave: I’m not watching it either, just wondering if Newcastle had shown up or not. Chelsea sneaking into top 6 🙄
15/5/24, 10:41 pm - James: Yep Chelsea got it. Brighton didn't show up
15/5/24, 10:42 pm - James: Manure showed up like they sporadically do
15/5/24, 10:42 pm - James: Means nothing though they'll still finish 8th lol
15/5/24, 10:47 pm - Louie: Watch us concede two pens
15/5/24, 10:48 pm - James: Fernandes unbelievable
15/5/24, 10:49 pm - James: We all lose, Chelsea get 6th 😢
15/5/24, 10:59 pm - James: Almost 😅
15/5/24, 11:00 pm - James: Just got told even the sky sports manure studio were saying pen all day at ht
15/5/24, 11:00 pm - Louie: We must have paid our VAR fees this week
15/5/24, 11:00 pm - James: I didn't see it
15/5/24, 11:07 pm - Jono: Ten Hag takes the microphone
15/5/24, 11:08 pm - Jono: Was hoping he’d spontaneously break out some Take A Chance On Me
15/5/24, 11:51 pm - James: Reece James back from injury and a red card lol

It’s getting too wild. Glad my kids are at a Catholic school
16/5/24, 5:10 am - Jono: Happy to be explained otherwise but seeing boys out on the field against girls coz they’re transitioning threw me over the edge
16/5/24, 5:10 am - Pero: The conventional male was very polite in his decline . Conventional chiks were never so polite when declining
16/5/24, 5:10 am - Jono: Poor bloke didn’t know where to run
16/5/24, 5:11 am - Pero: He got out as quick as possible 😅

19/5/24, 11:13 pm - Gerrard: Back up the truck
19/5/24, 11:14 pm - James: Arteta needs to move with the times
19/5/24, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: Someone tripped over the extension lead and took out Arteta's one idea
19/5/24, 11:14 pm - James: Use LED's
19/5/24, 11:14 pm - James: Wasting so much electricity
19/5/24, 11:14 pm - James: Not energy efficient
19/5/24, 11:14 pm - Gerrard: Next season will be their season for sure
19/5/24, 11:15 pm - James: Trust the process...
19/5/24, 11:15 pm - Gerrard: Yeah ask Philadelphia 76er fans how the Trust The Process motto treated them
19/5/24, 11:16 pm - Gerrard: Took them to zero titles too
19/5/24, 11:16 pm - James: https://x.com/footballontnt/status/1792224155594596836?s=08
19/5/24, 11:17 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 I think he's having a stroke, keeps sending the same photo over and over
19/5/24, 11:17 pm - James: @14244893404?
19/5/24, 11:17 pm - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣
19/5/24, 11:17 pm - Gerrard: Everyone else is just rattled
19/5/24, 11:18 pm - James: Fuck sake we scored 85 goals. Shame we can't defend
19/5/24, 11:21 pm - James: He is the best
19/5/24, 11:21 pm - James: Always innovative
20/5/24, 12:01 am - Dave: He is, no denying it
20/5/24, 12:13 am - Gerrard: Can be the best and still be a cheater
20/5/24, 12:14 am - Gerrard: @61404487873 would love to see what he could do with Arsenal
20/5/24, 12:16 am - Wilson: He gave them arteta, jesus and zinchenko, he turned them into a team that beat Liverpool to second
20/5/24, 12:23 am - James: And trained cryteta
20/5/24, 12:24 am - James: @61409710717 I guess varsey will have to spend another £250m to 'compete' in the summer?
20/5/24, 12:24 am - Gerrard: It's still funny that Arsenal fans thought City's and Chelsea's rejects were good players and gonna win them the league
20/5/24, 12:24 am - Gerrard: Probably
20/5/24, 12:25 am - Gerrard: More money please daddy Edu
20/5/24, 12:25 am - James: Woah
20/5/24, 12:25 am - Gerrard: Do we have more photo's of Arsenal players crying?
Can someone Photoshop that Oddygard with the camera onto it?
20/5/24, 12:26 am - James: Haven't seen any. When are fan reactions out?
20/5/24, 12:30 am - Gerrard: Did Arteta cry or blame the refs?
20/5/24, 12:32 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7Kn-EEvIGt/?igsh=a2Nzb2NnMnRlZGxh
@61404487873 if Pep cares more about Klopp leaving than 4 in a row

20/5/24, 12:33 am - Gerrard: All 20 of them
20/5/24, 12:33 am - Gerrard: Can't expect someone else to do the job for you

20/5/24, 12:35 am - Gerrard: 👋🏻@14244893404 hope you not having another stroke!
20/5/24, 12:35 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 now he's hoping for a title strip
20/5/24, 12:36 am - James: Embarrassing
20/5/24, 12:36 am - Gerrard: Arteta's body isn't even cold yet
20/5/24, 12:37 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 you know best thing about today?
20/5/24, 12:40 am - James: I'm listening
20/5/24, 12:41 am - Dave: Just highlighting your obsession lad. We’re on the same side
20/5/24, 12:41 am - Gerrard: It's not @14244893404's tears.
It's being right.
20/5/24, 12:41 am - Dave: Stop cumming your pants <This message was edited>
20/5/24, 12:42 am - Dave: Sums it up
20/5/24, 12:43 am - Dave: Pep didn’t even celebrate when whistle went. Business as usual
20/5/24, 12:44 am - Dave: 115
20/5/24, 12:44 am - Gerrard: Right about:
Arsenal not winning the league.
Arteta not being the guy who'll win them anything.
Arsenal being serial bottle jobs.
Their players being weak willed.
Arteta being a cry baby.
Rice not being the gamechanger they thought.
20/5/24, 12:44 am - Dave: Rent. Free.
20/5/24, 12:44 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 I can tell that one hurt

20/5/24, 12:45 am - Dave: If Jono had typed it I would have been hurt, I respect his ball opinion. 

Don’t even blink when jezzy the troll sends a message anymore
20/5/24, 12:46 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 he's desperate and cornered, trying everything he can
20/5/24, 12:49 am - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/shorts/YDKGJ0ERK3E?si=NEk6Z5iggcVNV99e

Never forget
20/5/24, 12:50 am - James: They don't run around taking their clothes off wanking each other silly over last minute equalisers either
20/5/24, 12:50 am - Gerrard: Especially halfway through the season
20/5/24, 12:51 am - Gerrard: Hey good news is Arsenal will get a shot at another community shield, three cheers for United being shite 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
20/5/24, 1:00 am - James: They didn't win anything though?
20/5/24, 1:21 am - Jono: https://www.facebook.com/share/v/nhtnaARhGjUznnHd/?mibextid=WC7FNe m
Fuck I hate this cunt but pending 115, he’s absolutely right
20/5/24, 1:32 am - Pero: Didn't realise how deep the arsenal hate is
20/5/24, 1:33 am - Pero: If arsenal are this bad everyone below them must be bottom of the barrel scum
20/5/24, 1:41 am - Gerrard: Wow called out
20/5/24, 1:42 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 Curly's stroke is contagious
20/5/24, 1:47 am - James: Still rattling?
20/5/24, 1:48 am - Gerrard: Like a dodgey trolley wheel
20/5/24, 1:50 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 Arsenal suck balls
20/5/24, 1:51 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 Arteta is a Spanish Brendan Rodgers
20/5/24, 1:55 am - James: What a photo
20/5/24, 1:56 am - Dave: Classic!!!
20/5/24, 1:56 am - Jono: I wonder if we'd have beaten Palace that day would Arsenal have done the same v Villa...
20/5/24, 2:04 am - Jono: Now you know...
20/5/24, 2:07 am - Gerrard: Ouchie
20/5/24, 2:08 am - Gerrard: I wonder if Arsenal had a real manager what would've happened
20/5/24, 2:18 am - James: Oh my is that real!?!
20/5/24, 2:18 am - Jono: It is
20/5/24, 2:18 am - Jono: We had one too the year City beat Villa on the last day
20/5/24, 2:18 am - James: Unfair on Lance, they were all doing it
20/5/24, 2:19 am - James: Fuck bro 🤣
20/5/24, 2:31 am - Gerrard: Don't humanise Arsenal fans
20/5/24, 2:43 am - Gerrard: @14244893404 Arsenal
20/5/24, 2:43 am - Gerrard: The moral victory.
Arteta has neither @14244893404
20/5/24, 2:47 am - James: https://x.com/Iewdawg/status/1792255791187063218?s=08
20/5/24, 3:20 am - Dave: Crumblepool rekt. We were the only side good enough to challenge city this year. Klapp fucked it
20/5/24, 3:21 am - Dave: Do Bruno’s. So I can decide whether I want him or rice next season
20/5/24, 3:24 am - James: @61409710717 nerve struck and he's active in the chat but I don't know what he's going on about now?
20/5/24, 3:24 am - Dave: Liverpool may have bottled it, but it’s an improvement from last year. Champions league footy 🤝
20/5/24, 3:25 am - Dave: Newty though
20/5/24, 3:25 am - Dave: Leicestercastle with zero accolades lolz 😂😂😂😂😂
20/5/24, 3:26 am - James: @61409710717 he's going on about Newcastle for some reason?
20/5/24, 3:31 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 precious
20/5/24, 3:32 am - James: Is he trying @61409710717?
20/5/24, 3:32 am - Gerrard: Rattle city bitch, rat-rattle city bitch
20/5/24, 3:32 am - Gerrard: He's either not trying or trying so hard he's fumbling it
20/5/24, 3:32 am - Dave: Klapp only won his last game because he played 10 men 😳
20/5/24, 3:32 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
20/5/24, 3:33 am - Dave: @61452662705 Watch your step,
It’ll only be us in here next year
20/5/24, 3:34 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 completely lost it
20/5/24, 3:35 am - James: Like varsey?
20/5/24, 3:35 am - Dave: Going to @ you so much next year 🤗
20/5/24, 3:35 am - Dave: Glorious
20/5/24, 3:36 am - Dave: Do us all a solid. Stay in here and don’t set up a Liverpool fan support group again. 

We want to feel the pain this time
20/5/24, 3:37 am - Dave: Jezzy the definition of sing when you’re winning
20/5/24, 3:37 am - Dave: And jimmity just a psychopath but I respect that
20/5/24, 3:38 am - Dave: Knows he’s shit but keeps swinging 👊
20/5/24, 3:40 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 oh my gawd
20/5/24, 3:56 am - James: When do we begin to worry about him?
20/5/24, 4:37 am - Gerrard: I started worrying about him when he said "I support Arsenal"
20/5/24, 5:45 am - Gerrard: Big X-Men fan in here today
20/5/24, 5:47 am - Gerrard: Brilliant
20/5/24, 6:03 am - Gerrard: Arteta: "To me, my ex-men!"
20/5/24, 6:04 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 can't believe Xhaka got a title one year away from Arsenal
20/5/24, 6:23 am - Gerrard: https://youtube.com/watch?v=XqvgS2NRwzI&si=4kIz2EKy5Ev6VNbE
20/5/24, 6:33 am - James: Trouble in paradise?
20/5/24, 6:41 am - Gerrard: ArtetaIN I say
20/5/24, 6:42 am - Gerrard: Robbie taking Oddy over KDB
20/5/24, 6:45 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 what do you think of all these Arsenal fans that slagged off Klopp for not getting more titles, now saying Arteta is up against such a force in Pep&City so forgive him. <This message was edited>
20/5/24, 6:46 am - James: That yardman spoke the most sense
20/5/24, 6:46 am - James: Never heard such wisdom and truths from a varsey supporter
20/5/24, 6:47 am - Gerrard: As Liverpool learnt, you ain't gonna win the league with a Brendan Rodgers - Arsenal should learn, not even the Spanish Brendan Rodgers can

20/5/24, 8:31 am - James: Home AND away @61409710717!!!
20/5/24, 8:31 am - Gerrard: Collectors items
20/5/24, 8:32 am - James: @61409710717 so much content
20/5/24, 8:32 am - James: Bless the internet
20/5/24, 8:32 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 it's almost like it's not just us that think Arsenal are so arse
20/5/24, 8:51 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4qCBacsPeM/?igsh=MTFleWlwaTRseDd5dA==
20/5/24, 11:33 am - Pero: All distractions to how crap livo finished the season after being favourites to win it in klopps final year
20/5/24, 11:36 am - James: https://x.com/NetSpendKings/status/1792259732134072781?s=08
20/5/24, 4:35 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 he didn't sleep that stroke off
20/5/24, 4:37 pm - Dave: It’s been deflection city, totally rent free. Never seen so many messages about Arsenal. That’s how I know we’re on the right track. 

No one’s even talking about flopp abandoning Liverpool after bottling 3 trophies <This message was edited>
20/5/24, 4:40 pm - Dave: @61422023136 @61478754484 we move onwards and upwards. Clubs growing, teams growing and maturing. Major trophies are loading 💪
20/5/24, 4:41 pm - Gerrard: If you got more than 30yrs you'll never hear the end of this

20/5/24, 4:47 pm - Dave: We won’t. We’re not Liverpool
20/5/24, 4:47 pm - Gerrard: Two thirds of the way there Curly
20/5/24, 4:48 pm - Gerrard: You've been pretty confident of winning something last few years and it's turned up a big fat goose egg
20/5/24, 4:48 pm - Dave: Let us know we are as shit as you in ten years then, set a reminder
20/5/24, 4:49 pm - Gerrard: Stick to posting that picture, you sound daft when you type words
20/5/24, 4:49 pm - Gerrard: Oh he's typing again
20/5/24, 4:49 pm - Gerrard: Arsenal suck

20/5/24, 4:50 pm - Gerrard: Goodnight
20/5/24, 4:50 pm - Dave: Rent free. Nothing to say. Hero abandoned you and a long lonely road of decline ahead ❤️
20/5/24, 10:11 pm - James: 🤣
20/5/24, 11:07 pm - James: Put Ten Hag or Arteta in that role and Citeh win nothing
20/5/24, 11:07 pm - Dave: Behave you dope
20/5/24, 11:07 pm - Dave: Ten hag no. Arteta would win trophies <This message was edited>
20/5/24, 11:07 pm - Dave: So would Klopp
20/5/24, 11:07 pm - Dave: So would Howe
20/5/24, 11:08 pm - Dave: Any decent manager would destroy that league with city resources. 

Peps still a genius, still best manager in the world. 

Maybe other managers wouldn’t be winning trebles etc, but they’d win major trophies
20/5/24, 11:10 pm - Dave: You actually got me there. Comparing ten hag to arteta lol. Trigggeeeereeeddd
20/5/24, 11:31 pm - Pero: 💯we'll be stronger again next year growing even more, playing even better, improving on weaknesses
21/5/24, 12:08 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 🧐
21/5/24, 12:33 am - Wilson: Even Le Professeur agrees
21/5/24, 12:42 am - Gerrard: That old senile cunt has lost it
21/5/24, 4:21 am - Gerrard changed this group's icon
21/5/24, 12:54 am - James: I knew who they were 😬
21/5/24, 2:23 am - James: Trouble in paradise?

21/5/24, 2:34 am - Gerrard: Jose is so much better than Wenger eh
21/5/24, 2:53 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 this guys is just like Arteta, one trick pony, no back up plan
21/5/24, 2:56 am - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
21/5/24, 2:56 am - Gerrard: They really did this to themselves
21/5/24, 2:56 am - Gerrard: I remember @61478754484 and @61422023136 saying they weren't gonna get carried away like other years
21/5/24, 2:57 am - James: Wow
21/5/24, 2:57 am - Gerrard: They promised me
21/5/24, 2:58 am - Gerrard: I like Oddygard but you can't expect a 5yrold to captain a bunch of Muppets to a title
21/5/24, 3:00 am - James: Jesus!
21/5/24, 3:05 am - Gerrard: I feel bad for Rice, going from winning European trophies to bottling titles
21/5/24, 3:12 am - Pero: Didn't get carried away at all we were cheering on the gunners till the very end , cant get much closer then that. Unlike all the other shitbox teams their seasons were bottled and sealed weeks prior
21/5/24, 3:15 am - Jono: I always thought 3rd was our ceiling. Was always shocked when that Opta bullshit predictions would have us further up than Arsenal especially when they were unbeaten for over 2 months
21/5/24, 3:16 am - Jono: So that softened the blow slightly. Kind of wish we were 10 pts back in Jan but i guess that may have put us further back in the pack

@61452662705
21/5/24, 3:17 am - Gerrard: Saying "we" puts you in with the getting carried away AFTV boys in here
21/5/24, 3:35 am - Dave: So proud of the lads this season. Fought until the bitter end. Huge improvement on last season mate
21/5/24, 3:36 am - Dave: Took 4 points off city, 4 off Liverpool, 6 off United, 6 off Chelsea, 4 off spurs
21/5/24, 3:36 am - Dave: Incredibly good season. Little rough patch at the end of last year cost us the title. Is what it is
21/5/24, 3:43 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 fark, if you do that and still not win the title - I guess they really bottled it against some lesser teams
21/5/24, 4:20 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7Nhmfehq7u/?igsh=OW81NWdhY214d2h3

21/5/24, 5:53 am - Dave: There was only one bottle job this year lad 😁
21/5/24, 6:02 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 now he's a Tottenham sympathiser, head's gone
21/5/24, 6:17 am - James: Probably shouldn't have gone to spurs then!?

21/5/24, 7:00 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 this is what I mean, imagine they made even a cup final - pandemonium

21/5/24, 8:17 am - Gerrard: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7H_Cp1CVZk/?igsh=aDk3YnlkYnphaTk3
21/5/24, 8:37 am - Gerrard: 🥲🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
21/5/24, 12:44 pm - James: That they only wear for one tournament
21/5/24, 5:16 pm - Dave: That’s wild
21/5/24, 5:17 pm - Dave: Refuse to buy anymore shirts until Southgate is gone
21/5/24, 8:19 pm - Dave: https://x.com/deadlinedaylive/status/1792834533446082577?s=42&t=K3bpVxrTHOXknZ71ZGmfhA
21/5/24, 8:20 pm - Dave: Looks like city are getting off scott-free then.
21/5/24, 10:12 pm - James: Poch gone
21/5/24, 10:12 pm - James: Weird. He did well
21/5/24, 10:12 pm - James: In the end
21/5/24, 10:30 pm - Dave: That todds a fucking idiot. Like you said, was just starting to get some great results
21/5/24, 10:35 pm - James: Basket case for 18 months and he finally got them gelled
21/5/24, 10:35 pm - James: Must be something else
21/5/24, 10:36 pm - James: Like he's not allowed to have a say on transfers or something
21/5/24, 11:29 pm - Dave: Thanks city
21/5/24, 11:31 pm - James: Not their fault they won games
21/5/24, 11:31 pm - Dave: Many more years of that to come
@61404487873. UK government essentially confirmed today they’re in bed with Middle East and nothings going to change lol
22/5/24, 12:36 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 what are the AFTV boys crying about today???
The season's been over a while now.
22/5/24, 12:46 am - James: That forward selection is insane
22/5/24, 12:46 am - James: Where is Tomori though 😂
22/5/24, 12:46 am - James: And wtf is Gomez and Quansah doing in there
22/5/24, 12:47 am - James: @61404060785 think you said there is no excuses to not win the tournament
22/5/24, 12:47 am - James: Except for the fact its England
22/5/24, 12:47 am - James: And Southgate
22/5/24, 12:48 am - Gerrard: And Curtis
22/5/24, 12:48 am - James: No sledge but no
22/5/24, 12:48 am - James: The back five will be the exact same as the last three tournaments
22/5/24, 12:49 am - Gerrard: Best English players in the league
22/5/24, 12:49 am - Gerrard: You sound like an Arsenal fan with your false hope
22/5/24, 12:49 am - James: No hope at all
22/5/24, 12:49 am - James: Until we get to semis
22/5/24, 12:49 am - James: Then it's coming home
22/5/24, 12:50 am - James: They're not even English
22/5/24, 12:50 am - Gerrard: Exactly right
22/5/24, 12:55 am - Jono: Gomez a jack of all trades i think its probably why Gareth threw him in. Tomori should've gone instead of Quansah 100%
22/5/24, 12:56 am - James: What is it with tomori
22/5/24, 12:56 am - James: He's class
22/5/24, 12:57 am - Jono: Foden has to play in the 10 role in front of Jude... I think Kane being injured could be a blessing. Watkins would do a great job and would have less pressure than Harry
22/5/24, 12:57 am - Jono: England HAVE to win a trophy with this squad sooner rather than later
22/5/24, 1:03 am - Gerrard: 🤣🤣🤣
22/5/24, 1:08 am - Dave: Won’t win a bean with Southgate anywhere near that squad
22/5/24, 1:09 am - Dave: No call up for solanke lol. He’s on the pipe
22/5/24, 1:09 am - Dave: Guarantee his reasoning is “well solanke doesn’t play for a big team”
22/5/24, 1:10 am - Dave: Wonder if he has beef with him. He’s such an odd bloke
22/5/24, 1:11 am - Jono: No Sancho either lol could win a UCL in a few weeks
22/5/24, 1:12 am - Dave: Exactly. Anyone with half a brain cell can see the problem with Sancho was ten hag
22/5/24, 1:13 am - Jono: So many Palace players lol
22/5/24, 1:13 am - Dave: I was watching a highlight clip of Antony at Ajax a couple of days ago and was blown away by how good he was there
22/5/24, 1:13 am - Jono: Southgate must've made a trip to Selhurst and went, my work here is done
22/5/24, 1:14 am - Dave: Don’t know what ten hag is doing to those lads but he needs to take a long look in the mirror
22/5/24, 1:29 am - Gerrard: No Arsenal highlights worth watching, resorting to Anthony highlights now
22/5/24, 2:10 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 got him up to 51 posts of the same pic, I should get a prize
22/5/24, 2:14 am - Dave: = 51 toxic shit posts about Arsenal. 

Got a lot of hate in that heart of yours 🖤

22/5/24, 2:22 am - Gerrard: Definitely more than that, you missed a few - just like Arsenal missed out on winning anything since Arteta took over <This message was edited>
22/5/24, 2:24 am - Gerrard: 52, the number of times Arteta dummy spat this season about refs
22/5/24, 2:27 am - Dave: That’s 52 in the last 4 days. You’re into solid 5 figures this season. 

RENT. FREE
22/5/24, 2:45 am - Gerrard: Arteta is the worst manager I've ever seen and I've seen Steve Bruce
22/5/24, 3:05 am - Gerrard: Bruce has more people's respect
22/5/24, 3:24 am - James: Arwetta said he was one of the most important managers in the history of managers <This message was edited>

22/5/24, 6:44 am - Jono: Haha
22/5/24, 7:06 am - Dave: What Liverpool cherry picked dribble is this
22/5/24, 7:07 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 damn he didn't post his pic
22/5/24, 7:07 am - Gerrard: Oh wait
22/5/24, 7:09 am - Dave: Back in the day of real rivalries.

Not pretend ones where certain clubs had to rely on global pandemics and mass absences to win a title <This message was edited>
22/5/24, 7:11 am - Gerrard: Aren't Arsenal fucking shit eh

22/5/24, 11:39 am - Dave: Manchester just deleted from the prem 🤤
22/5/24, 11:46 am - Gerrard: Booya
22/5/24, 11:46 am - Gerrard: Told you
22/5/24, 11:50 am - Dave: You’re an absolute smooth brain if you’re putting Klopp above Mourinho or Wenger. 

Shows you it’s just kids and casuals using that app.
22/5/24, 11:50 am - Gerrard: Where's Arteta?
22/5/24, 11:54 am - Dave: Why would arteta be in there?
22/5/24, 11:55 am - Gerrard: Exactly because he's a shithouse manager
22/5/24, 11:55 am - Dave: Why would Klopp be in there LOL
22/5/24, 11:55 am - Gerrard: Arsenal are in a fucking joke
22/5/24, 11:55 am - Dave: One title in ten years and 9% of the votes went to klippety 😂😂😂
22/5/24, 11:55 am - Gerrard: Arsenal fans are the most delusional in the world
22/5/24, 11:59 am - Dave: Not at all, we’re just not delusional like you lot. 

Shouldn’t even be in the discussion if you haven’t won multiple titles.
22/5/24, 12:00 pm - Gerrard: Smells like AFTV up in here
22/5/24, 12:02 pm - Dave: Fergie should have won that poll by about 85% of the votes with a few delusional city, Chelsea and Arsenal fans going for pep, mourinho and Wenger. 

It’s a disgrace even seeing cult hero Klopp’s name in that poll
22/5/24, 12:04 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 heads gone
22/5/24, 12:04 pm - Dave: James what’s that box around pep’s name? Did you vote for pep?
22/5/24, 12:17 pm - James: Yeah I can't vote for fergie
22/5/24, 12:17 pm - James: Fuck him
22/5/24, 12:17 pm - James: Just a cheerleader
22/5/24, 12:18 pm - James: Wouldn't know what to do in the modern game
22/5/24, 12:20 pm - Gerrard: He was better than Wengy though
22/5/24, 12:27 pm - Jono: Fuck me why are Euro selected players playing in this exhibition game? Haha
22/5/24, 12:44 pm - James: Madness

22/5/24, 9:57 pm - James: Gaped Ange in his own back yard in front of his own people 💪
22/5/24, 10:08 pm - Dave: Alright Jamie. Get back to what you’re good at, spitting at little girls
22/5/24, 11:00 pm - Jono: #AlonsoOut
22/5/24, 11:00 pm - Jono: How dare he lose a game
22/5/24, 11:00 pm - Jono: What a spanking
22/5/24, 11:00 pm - Jono: Knew Atalanta were a pretty good team
22/5/24, 11:03 pm - James: Lookman and Scamacca their star players.
22/5/24, 11:03 pm - James: Both shite in England
22/5/24, 11:04 pm - James: Time to go innit
22/5/24, 11:11 pm - James: How has Kompany got the Bayern job 😂
22/5/24, 11:12 pm - Pero: Doesn't matter what he done throughout the season , coming 2nd he must be a piece of shit #alonsoOut
22/5/24, 11:13 pm - Dave: Liverpool dodged a bullet there, good job they got their lego ETH
22/5/24, 11:15 pm - Jono: He coached in England so he must be awesome
22/5/24, 11:18 pm - Jono: https://x.com/dalejohnsonespn/status/1793387436761854212?s=46

This is really complicated
22/5/24, 11:22 pm - Jono: I love that UCL title holders get higher rankings when it comes to pot allocations
22/5/24, 11:22 pm - Jono: 👏🥰
22/5/24, 11:44 pm - Dave: Who’s comparing them? 

This another little fantasy beef Liverpool fans are creating to make themselves relevant again
23/5/24, 3:45 am - Gerrard: Arteta is so shit
23/5/24, 4:03 am - Gerrard: Arteta is a genius that he got Arsenal fans to believe he's improved the club
23/5/24, 4:03 am - Gerrard: @61452662705 it was just spending money finally that got them there, I wish the club back Wengy and Unai like that
23/5/24, 4:04 am - Gerrard: Smallest club in London
23/5/24, 4:06 am - Dave: No Liverpool players 🤔 https://amp.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/20/premier-league-2023-24-review-players-of-the-season

23/5/24, 10:36 pm - James: Paqueta is in big trouble
24/5/24, 12:34 am - Pero: Paqueta even looks like Bruno
24/5/24, 6:45 am - Liam: Great players
24/5/24, 7:43 am - Dave: Especially xhaka. Club legend. Happy for him. Don’t turn on our own 🤝

24/5/24, 11:40 am - James: Looks like it. Why bother
24/5/24, 11:59 am - Chris: Don't know a single one of them. I'd request a refund.
24/5/24, 12:22 pm - Pero: It could of been a cricket line up for all we knew
24/5/24, 12:32 pm - Chris: With a line up like that you wouldn't know they're the richest club in the world
24/5/24, 5:45 pm - Shaun: hope he goes to liveprool
24/5/24, 6:44 pm - Dave: This real? 😂😂😂😂😂😂
24/5/24, 6:56 pm - Dave: Liverpool fans turned on him as quickly as a concussed Karius

25/5/24, 4:44 pm - James: True
25/5/24, 4:54 pm - Louie: We are only 2-0 up, so this is different 🤞
25/5/24, 5:58 pm - Louie: Nostradamus
25/5/24, 5:59 pm - Wilson: Good night everyone 🍻🥲🍻🥲🍻🥲
25/5/24, 6:12 pm - You changed this group's icon
25/5/24, 6:12 pm - James: Innit. Called
25/5/24, 11:59 pm - Gerrard: @61452662705 no community for Arsenal this time....
25/5/24, 11:59 pm - Gerrard: That's what you get

26/5/24, 6:05 am - Gerrard changed this group's icon
26/5/24, 6:05 am - Gerrard changed the group name from "Good Stats Friends" to "Teams who won trophies Friends + Arsenal Fans"
26/5/24, 7:12 am - Dave: I remember when we won FA cup and finished 8th in 2020 and got absolutely bantered for celebrating a Mickey Mouse trophy and not getting champions league
26/5/24, 7:14 am - Dave: United fans gone from wanting ten hags head on a stick to building a statue of him outside old Trafford
26/5/24, 7:15 am - James: Ten Hag first two seasons FA Cup, Carabou and a 3rd place finish
26/5/24, 7:15 am - James: Klips last two seasons, 3rd and a Karaboo
26/5/24, 7:16 am - Dave: Inherited a world class squad
26/5/24, 7:16 am - Dave: Expected
26/5/24, 7:16 am - James: Arteta last two seasons, 2x 2nd place
26/5/24, 7:16 am - James: 🤷
26/5/24, 7:16 am - James: 🤷🤷🤷
26/5/24, 7:16 am - James: Yet, Ten Hag is a failure 🤷
26/5/24, 7:17 am - James: Inherited a toxic squad
26/5/24, 7:18 am - Dave: Like I said to my ecstatic United mate this morning when he came knocking to gloat.. 

Would you swap our season and squad for yours given the chance? Went awfully quiet
26/5/24, 7:20 am - James: Trophies
26/5/24, 7:20 am - Dave: He controls the culture and mentality at the club, that’s literally his job. He’s totally inept at keeping his house in order. Sancho drama, rashford drama, Ronaldo drama, Antony drama
26/5/24, 7:21 am - Dave: Yeah I wouldn’t give up the progress we’ve made in the last two seasons for 10 FA cups lol, keep them
26/5/24, 7:42 am - Gerrard: Way better than Arteta

5/6/24, 2:12 am - Dave: No clue. Been singing it for years 😂 

Illegal for Germans to deny the details of WWII but English also banned from reminding them of it 🫠
5/6/24, 2:13 am - James: The should be reminded each day
5/6/24, 2:14 am - Dave: Watch them backtrack. They’ll be defending city IF charged

7/6/24, 5:42 am - James: Away one especially
7/6/24, 5:47 am - Dave: Also my only real gripe. Would like white in there as well, best backup available for Walker. Is what it is <This message was edited>

8/6/24, 4:25 am - James: Saka doesn't start does he?
8/6/24, 4:26 am - James: If we want to win that is
8/6/24, 4:26 am - Gerrard: Is it, let Southgate fuck it up?
8/6/24, 4:26 am - James: Gordon and Foden flanking Kane
8/6/24, 4:26 am - James: Heard Gordon was best player

10/6/24, 2:49 am - Pero: Indeed. It'll give other good attackers in real more reason to find another club next season

11/6/24, 5:15 am - James: Coaching
11/6/24, 5:16 am - James: He's no Mark Schwarzer
11/6/24, 5:26 am - Gerrard: Lol
11/6/24, 5:39 am - James: James Trafford on way to Newcastle apparently
11/6/24, 5:39 am - James: No Pope. No hope
11/6/24, 5:48 am - Gerrard: Who's that.
11/6/24, 5:48 am - Gerrard: ?
11/6/24, 5:54 am - James: Man City product was at Burnley last season

11/6/24, 6:50 am - James: Ruthless from Gareth for once. No rashford, sterling or maguire 😯
11/6/24, 6:50 am - James: Coming home 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
11/6/24, 7:19 am - Dave: Best part is United patiently waiting in the wings to get their man
11/6/24, 7:19 am - Dave: So obvious they’re waiting for Southgate to get booted so they can swoop in
11/6/24, 7:19 am - Dave: Absolute weirdos
11/6/24, 7:20 am - James: Nothing has changed there
11/6/24, 7:21 am - James: Still a toxic cesspit
11/6/24, 7:24 am - Dave: But what’s the point in getting Southgate? Because he’s a nice bloke and used to be a diplomat? What’s the obsession? 

Didn’t think he’d even get a job in the championship after England
11/6/24, 7:38 am - James: They tapped up our DOF and he's been put on gardening leave for two years until they pay what we want. Sir Jim thinks it 'silly'.

Silly to pay compensation for another clubs DOF even after being found out that they approached him illegally. Jimmy also thinks the British tax payer should pay for the refurbishment of old trafford 😂 rich coming from Mr Tax Dodger himself
11/6/24, 7:39 am - Gerrard: Southgate doing the George Constanza opposite day
11/6/24, 7:40 am - Dave: Get fucked, you serious?! Taxpayer should pay?! 😂😂😂 on what grounds?
11/6/24, 7:40 am - James: Nobody watches Seinfeld
11/6/24, 7:41 am - James: If you're bored, look up what I've said there. About the Newcastle DOF and what he said about old trafford
11/6/24, 7:41 am - James: Guy is cooked. Perfect for them
11/6/24, 7:42 am - James: Another mike ashley 👌
11/6/24, 7:43 am - James: They thought they were going to get a Dubai prince, instead they got the poundshop version

12/6/24, 3:17 am - James: Interesting how Villa are £0 in debt but have to sell a star player to meet PSR 😂 whilst manure are hundreds of millions in debt and can spend...

Oh and Chelsea just sold a hotel to themselves to meet PSR rules 😂
